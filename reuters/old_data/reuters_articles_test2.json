            "text": "Israeli airline El Al (ELAL.TA)New Tab said on Sunday it was returning Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 777-200ER aircraft to its fleet to meet high travel demand during the summer. Israel's flag carrier sidelined six 777s at the outset of the COVID-19 crisis when it halted all flights between March and September 2020 amid plunging demand. Its aging 747s had already been retired and replaced by 15 new Dreamliner 787 aircraft on long haul routes to North America and Asia. The airline has six 777 planes with an average age of nearly two decades and said it would return some of them to service for its routes to Bangkok, Phuket, Athens and Dubai -- destinations it said are in demand. \"The return of the planes will make it possible to expand the flight schedule in the peak season and even allow additional destinations,\" El Al said. It added that the aircraft, some of which were used on cargo routes, have passed all tests and adjustments needed to return to the skies. According to Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion Airport data, the number of passengers on El Al rose 151% in June over June 2021. Over the first half of 2022, 1.6 million passengers flew El Al, up from 400,000 a year earlier.",

            "text": "The U.S. Space Force said on Monday that Elon Musk's SpaceX was granted approval to lease a second rocket launch complex at a military base in California, setting the space company up for its fifth launch site in the United States. Under the lease, SpaceX will launch its workhorse Falcon rockets from Space Launch Complex-6 at Vandenberg Space Force Base, a military launch site north of Los Angeles where the space company operates another launchpad. It has two others in Florida and its private Starbase site in south Texas. A Monday night Space Force statement said a letter of support for the decision was signed on Friday by Space Launch Delta 30 commander Col. Rob Long. The statement did not mention a duration of SpaceX's lease. The new launch site, vacated last year by the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance, gives SpaceX more room to handle an increasingly busy launch schedule for commercial, government and internal satellite launches. Vandenberg Space Force Base allows for launches in a southern trajectory over the Pacific ocean, which is often used for weather-monitoring, military or spy satellites that commonly rely on polar Earth orbits. SpaceX's grant of Space Launch Complex-6 comes as rocket companies prepare to compete for the Pentagon's Phase 3 National Security Space Launch program, a watershed military launch procurement effort expected to begin in the next year or so.",

            "text": "UN aviation experts are again discussing toughening emissions standards for commercial aircraft, less than six years before a previously agreed clampdown takes effect. Support for a new emissions standard could put pressure on planemakers, which need years to adapt to rule changes due to long production cycles, to cease producing their least efficient models, two sources familiar with the talks said. Experts from the United States and some European countries backed tougher emissions standards during a virtual gathering of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) group this week, according to working papers and sources. One of the sources said ICAO's Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) agreed on Thursday to draft new standards for civil aircraft, as part of broader efforts through 2025 to update rules for aircraft noise and emissions. But it remains unclear when the proposed standards for commercial aircraft, such as those made by planemakers Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab and Airbus SE (AIR.PA)New Tab , would be drafted and take effect, and how stringent they would be, the source said. \"It's a real struggle to see it all getting done by 2025,\" the source said. The meeting comes as ICAO is seeking broad agreement this fall on a long-term climate goal amid differences between Europe and China and growing pressure for aviation to curb emissions. While any standard would take years to draft, win support from countries and wind its way through ICAO, the prospect of tougher emissions rules could potentially become one more headache for pandemic-weary planemakers. \"Any new standard creates pressure for planemakers,\" said the second source. \"What we don't know is how much pressure.\" Montreal-based ICAO sets standards on everything from runway markings to crash investigations, which its 193 member states typically translate into regulatory requirements. ICAO declined comment ahead of an official announcement. ICAO's governing council has already backed emissions rules that would be phased in for existing aircraft built from 2023, with a cut-off date of 2028 for planes that do not comply with the standard, unless exempted. Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab has already said it is weighing an exemption for its 767-300F, a popular freighter model that would otherwise have to cease production in 2028. ICAO experts also supported the drafting of new standards for supersonic jets, the first source said. Aircraft makers wanted new noise and engine emissions standards for supersonic jets, to help the fledgling industry. read more",

            "text": "A top Boeing (BA.N)New Tab executive on Wednesday urged suppliers to maintain the pace of the current 737 production schedule, but acknowledged that an ongoing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) audit of the company's 737 MAX production line could force changes to the schedule. Boeing reaffirmed its 737 master schedule in a Jan. 22 email to its suppliers following the Jan. 5 mid-air cabin panel blowout on a MAX 9, Reuters previously reported. The supplier master schedule, which lays out the expectation for when suppliers should be at a given production rate, calls for a production rate for the 737s of 42 per month, starting this month. However, the FAA capped Boeing's 737 production line at its current rate of 38 aircraft per month while the regulator investigates Boeing's manufacturing practices -- a situation which could leave Boeing lagging behind its supply chain, depending on how long the limit on production lasts. \"I would ask all of you to bear with us,\" Boeing supply chain head Ihssane Mounir said at an aerospace supplier conference outside Seattle, adding that the planemaker understands suppliers have had to hire workers and make investments ahead of the planned ramp-up. \"We will work with you on an individual basis in terms of what you need to do, whether that is building inventory, whether that is your business requirements,\" he said. Boeing has been embroiled in a full-blown safety and reputational crisis following the Jan. 5 accident involving a recently delivered Alaska Airlines (ALK.N)New Tab MAX 9. Mounir, in his first public remarks since the accident, struck a tone of unity, imploring suppliers to be transparent about problems that could lead to a breakdown in quality. \"Please raise your hands, talk to us,\" he said. \"If there are business requirements we need to address to help your stability and help the quality, we'll sit down and we'll go through those discussions.\" In addition to a Jan. 17 memo directing suppliers to ensure that bolts are properly tightened, which Reuters reported last month, Mounir said Boeing recently issued guidance to its supply chain to reduce traveled work on the 737 program. Traveled work is the practice of completing work on a production line out of the ordinary sequence.",

            "title": "Airbus rejects pressure to curb record jet output goal",
            "text": "Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab has rebuffed calls by aircraft leasing companies to temper plans to almost double production of its best-selling A320 jet family, telling them its ambitions are justified by expectations for post-pandemic demand, industry sources said. Major lessors have joined engine makers in warning Airbus that an aggressive output increase to a new peak above 70 aircraft a month could upset the market and hurt plane values while a recovery from the coronavirus crisis remains fragile. The latest approach came in separate letters to Airbus from at least two of the world's largest leasing companies, the sources said, confirming a Financial Times report. Airbus has responded by saying it is sticking to its plans, which involve a firm target of 64 A320-family jets a month in the second quarter of 2023, along with studies to raise monthly output to 70 in early 2024 and 75 by 2025. That compares with about 40 A320-family jets a month now and what was then a record level of 60 before the COVID-19 crisis. Airbus told leasing companies complaining about the plans that \"demand is there\", two people familiar with the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity. An Airbus spokesperson declined to comment on confidential correspondence but said: \"We continue to work on our commercial aircraft production ramp-up in line with the planning communicated in May 2021.\" Shares in the planemaker fell more than 2% on Monday. Representatives of lessors AerCap (AER.N)New Tab and Avolon, which are reported to have written to Airbus, were not immediately available for comment. The exchange deepens a row over the speed of recovery from a pandemic-induced travel slump that led to thousands of planes being grounded in the past year. Although arguments over right levels of supply are common between jetmakers and lessors who rely on maintaining the value of planes, tensions have escalated since the pandemic as lessors have collectively overtaken airlines as the biggest buyers. \"It’s the normal tension, but Airbus have to play the game carefully,\" said one senior industry source. \"Lessors always take their aircraft; you don’t want to alienate them too much.\" Industry pioneer Steven Udvar-Hazy, executive chairman of Air Lease Corp (AL.N)New Tab , warned of the dangers of overproduction at an Airline Economics conference last month read more . While most analysts agree that any recovery will benefit small jets such as the A320 and Boeing 737 first, the dispute focuses on whether it makes sense to raise output sharply before a glut of parked jets has returned to service - a step needed to rescue their earning potential for lessors and engine makers. Airbus says its demand forecasts are based on verified contracts and that the supply chain needs transparency over its future production plans to finance future capacity. However, it has yet to reach agreement with its suppliers over the most ambitious part of its plan. \"There is no agreement beyond 64 (a month); discussions are still happening,\" one supplier said. Others cautioned that even those output levels must confront post-crisis challenges over labour, shipping and inflation. Airbus aims to reach monthly output of 45 A320-family jets this quarter as a stepping stone towards its goals, but suppliers say the flow of parts is steady for now at about 40. Suppliers are worried that they may be forced to invest in more machinery and factory space only to see demand fail to recover as quickly as Airbus hopes, while lessors fear that any excess output could chop years off the life of jets that they rent out, forcing them to take a hit on their balance sheets. Engine makers fret that raising output of new jets too quickly could upset their own recovery by forcing existing jets into retirement rather than their repair shops. read more Airbus this month suggested it would exploit competition between engine makers CFM and Pratt & Whitney to secure its output plans. read more Both Safran (SAF.PA)New Tab , which co-owns CFM with General Electric (GE.N)New Tab , and Raytheon Technologies (RTX.N)New Tab , which controls Pratt, voiced concerns over jet output at mid-year.",

            "text": "Indian budget carrier IndiGo is in talks with both Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and its current supplier Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab to order more than 500 passenger jets, potentially smashing an industry record set by domestic rival Air India a few weeks ago, industry sources said. India's largest airline has until now been an exclusive buyer of narrow-body jets from Airbus and French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said last month that IndiGo was close to ordering several hundred planes from the European planemaker. But negotiations to keep renewing the budget carrier's fleet from the end of the decade have also broadened to include mid-sized wide-body jets, sparking a contest between Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and the upgraded Airbus A330neo, the sources said. IndiGo, owned by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd (INGL.NS)New Tab , is also comparing the A320neo with the Boeing 737 MAX as it weighs a major new order for narrow-body jets, they added. The split between wide- and narrow-body jets was not immediately clear. An IndiGo representative told Reuters the airline is constantly in talks with manufacturers as it plans its next phase of growth. \"However, we haven't finalised anything till now.\" Airbus declined to comment on any talks, saying it is \"always in contact with existing and potential customers\". Boeing had no immediate comment. IndiGo, which counts a 55% share of the domestic market, is widely expected to maintain Airbus as its supplier of narrow-body jets to squeeze out further economies of scale. It is already one of Airbus's largest customers and has so far ordered a total of 830 Airbus A320-family jets of which 488 are still to be delivered. But Indian analysts say Airbus will face a tougher fight for the wide-body order. In a departure from its single-aisle strategy, IndiGo last month began international operations with a Boeing 777, its first wide-body aircraft, taken from codeshare partner Turkish Airlines, which provides the pilots. Efforts by Indian carriers to keep pace with the world's fastest-growing aviation market, serving what is soon to become the largest population, have sent industry records tumbling even though manufacturers are struggling to meet output goals. Tata-owned Air India last month sealed deals for a record 470 jets from Airbus and Boeing and plans to lease another 25 for immediate needs, bringing the acquisition to 495 aircraft. The head of budget airline Akasa Air told Reuters last month it would place a \"substantially\" large order for new narrowbody jets this year on top of an existing Boeing 737 MAX order. Industry publication CAPA reported last month that IndiGo was looking at around 500 jets as Air India closed its own deal. Indian aviation has been hobbled in the past by airline failures, weak infrastructure and questions over the rights of foreign leasing companies that step in to finance the sales. While analysts have warned the market could overheat again, Dublin-based Avolon, one of the largest lessors, has said consolidation and airport upgrades have improved the outlook and India is set to remain a major source of growth. Indigo began operations in 2006 and flies to more than 75 Indian cities including to remote destinations in the country's northeast. It also flies internationally to nearby places including Dubai, Singapore, Hanoi and Maldives and is expanding into Europe through its partnership with Turkish Airlines.",

            "text": "Ethiopian Airlines (ETHA.UL) expects its passenger business to recover to pre-pandemic levels in its financial year ending in June, its chief executive told Reuters. Africa's biggest carrier will ferry 12.7 million passengers during the year, Mesfin Tasew Bekele said in an interview, up from 8.6 million passengers in the previous financial year and 12.1 million before the pandemic struck. Mesfin attributed the forecast to lifting of restrictions on movement around the world, the carrier's own expansion in terms of new planes and destinations, and a peace deal signed last month to end a two-year conflict in the north of the country. Any delays in re-opening of China could however curb the projections, Mesfin said, since it is a key market for both passengers and cargo. \"China is lagging behind in relaxing COVID restrictions... If it doesn't gradually relax the restrictions starting in January, it may have adverse impact on us,\" said Mesfin, who took over as CEO in March. Ethiopian fared much better than other African carriers during the pandemic, thanks to its cargo business that was able to compensate for a steep drop in passenger traffic. It is already looking beyond the health crisis with an expansion plan to double its fleet and network, boost annual revenue and passengers by 400% and 440% respectively, by 2035. \"Unless we grow, we cannot be successful,\" Mesfin said, adding that a larger network will give the business economies of scale. Under the expansion plan, Ethiopian is ordering new planes from Boeing (BA.N)New Tab , Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and De Havilland across all categories, aiming to double the size to 271, he said. It has started new routes to Zurich, Amman and Bulawayo since July, Mesfin said, and it is targeting Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Karachi, Copenhagen and Atlanta, part of the drive to double international destinations to 207 by the target year. The airline is also investing in new airport and training facilities, the chief executive said. Ethiopian is in final negotiations with the Nigerian government to set up a national airline for the west African nation in a joint venture, Mesfin said, adding the company has also signed an agreement with the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo for a similar arrangement. \"These two are big countries with big economies and populations providing strong base for national carriers. We are very eager to start these airlines in partnership,\" he said.",

On an adjusted basis, profit was $2.60 per share, compared with expectations of $2.59. Honeywell on Thursday also announced the election of CEO Vimal Kapur to the additional role of chairman of board, effective June 7.",

            "text": "The head of Dubai's Emirates has urged Rolls-Royce (RR.L)New Tab to go \"back to basics\" and focus on the performance of its engines, a day after the British firm laid out plans to quadruple profits. Shares in the engine maker rose after CEO Tufan Erginbilgic unveiled a strategy on Tuesday to revive its fortunes including a sharp increase in profit margins and \"value-driven pricing,\" suggesting higher servicing bills. But Emirates Airline President Tim Clark, who criticised Rolls over pricing and the performance of its largest engine at this month's Dubai Airshow, appeared unswayed by the plans which rely on sharply increasing civil engine profit margins to 15-17%. \"If you have an engine ... not performing as it should do, your costs are going to rise. But your ability to extract value from the client is going to fall simply because the client won't accept non-performance,\" he told Reuters, referring to the costs borne by engine makers due to service contracts per flight hour. \"It's a very clear kindergarten understanding of cause and effect. Get your product right, design it to what the client wants, give it that high level of reliability. And yes, paradoxically, you can extract more value for your money for your buck in terms of your investment.\" At this month's air show, Clark ruled out an immediate deal to buy Airbus A350-1000 jets, the larger of two models, blaming a dispute with Rolls over the poorer-than-expected durability of its engines, coupled with pressure for higher servicing prices. \"I said, guys, you need to go back to basics. Design engines that meet what the client base wants,\" Clark recalled saying to the engine maker during negotiations, which ultimately gave way to a top-up order for the smaller A350-900. \"We were ready on the -1000. You have no idea how much work I've spent on the interiors of these airplanes,\" Clark said, adding the engine stand-off had \"opened the door\" to reviving the Boeing 777-8 as a passenger variant as well as a freighter. Rolls-Royce had no further comment beyond Tuesday's investor presentation. Airbus declined to comment. Rolls has acknowledged that the downtime on the XWB-97 engine is greater than expected but has denied suggestions by Clark that the performance level equates to being \"defective\". Clark said the idea of ordering the A350-1000 was \"not off the table\" but added it depended on progress on downtime, noting that Rolls plans to introduce some modifications inherited from its Ultrafan engine technology research in late 2025 or 2026. \"I would say get your engines right .... I promise you: you come up with a good engine, and we will talk to you seriously about a sort of maintenance cost, which gives you the kind of returns that you seek without being over-greedy.\" Erginbilgic said on Tuesday the problem of durability was specific to the XWB-97 engine used on the A350-1000 and only in challenging climates. He said Rolls was working with Airbus \"to improve that engine to a great level\". The dispute between Emirates and Rolls has brought to light a tug of war between fuel efficiency and \"time on wing\" or durability of engines, which often have to be traded off against each other on the drawing board, especially for hot climates. Engine makers want to be rewarded more for their investments in cutting-edge technology given the value of the fuel savings and lower emissions they offer airlines on every mile of flight. Airlines say they bear the brunt of the disruption and reputational damage when aircraft face unplanned repairs, and have to do so on far narrower profit margins. \"When I see people talking about rates of return ... of 10% or 15%, and we're struggling as an airline industry generally in the realm of 3% or 4% - it's a partnership,\" Clark said. He brushed aside the idea of renegotiating existing engine contracts to raise hourly pricing, saying \"don't go there\". Clark, who is seen as one of the airline industry's most influential leaders and who runs the largest wide-body fleet, described Rolls as the \"gold standard\" in engineering but added they and others had been \"coming at it the wrong way\". The Emirates boss has also sharply criticised quality problems at Boeing. Broader industrial or supply problems have lingered since the pandemic, while some in the industry including Raytheon Technologies are returning cash to investors. Clark's message to the wider industry was straightforward. \"You're all fixated on buybacks, rates of return ... I promise you, build us the airplanes that we want and all this will fall into place\".",

            "text": "A global aviation leasing watchdog has for the second time cut India's compliance rating with international leasing laws and kept the country on a watchlist with a negative outlook amid a dispute between local airline Go First and its aircraft lessors. The move by the Aviation Working Group (AWG), a UK-based entity that monitors leasing and financing laws, comes as bankrupt budget carrier Go First is locked in a legal tussle with aircraft lessors seeking to repossess jets. The courtroom battle started after Go First was granted bankruptcy protection in May. Under Indian law, that prevented lessors from recovering 50-plus grounded Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab planes. The lessors have complained that critical plane parts are now corroding or getting \"robbed\". The AWG said 130 days had passed since the lessors' request to repossess their aircraft, more than double the maximum waiting period of 60 days according to India's obligations under the Cape Town Convention, an international treaty protecting the repossession rights of lessors. India has ratified the Cape Town Convention but has yet to pass a law resolving conflicts with the country's insolvency and bankruptcy code, which is backed by parliament. \"The prolonged failure to make remedies, including repossession and deregistration, available to creditors ... and provide for asset maintenance and value preservation ... negatively impact scoring,\" the AWG's notice said, warning of further rating downgrades. The AWG, a not-for-profit entity co-chaired by Airbus and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab , has reduced India's score to 2 from 3.5 out of 5. The negative outlook from AWG is under what it calls the compliance index, which addresses whether requirements under the Cape Town Convention are met in practice. This is the second such downgrade by AWG, which first placed India on a watchlist in May and assigned the country a negative outlook for its failure to process lessors' plane repossesion applications before the freeze on Go First's assets. The move could further hurt lessor confidence in the world's third-largest aviation market, warned AWG, whose members include major lessors and financial institutions such as Aircastle, BOC Aviation, SMBC Aviation Capital, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. SMBC, the world's second-largest aircraft lessor, which also has some planes leased to Go First, warned in May that India's decision to block leasing firms from reclaiming the airline's jets would hit lessors' confidence in that market.",

            "text": "U.S. President Joe Biden on Sunday secured deals with Vietnam on semiconductors and minerals as the strategic Southeast Asian nation lifted Washington to Hanoi's highest diplomatic status alongside China and Russia. The U.S. has been pushing for the upgrade for months as it sees the manufacturing dynamo as a key country in its strategy to secure global supply chains from China-related risks. A half-century after a lengthy and brutal Cold War-era conflict, Biden arrived in Hanoi to a ceremony organised by the ruling Communist Party that included school children waving American flags and honour guards carrying bayoneted rifles. Biden noted the strides that had been taken toward improved ties. \"We can trace a 50-year arc of progress between our nations, from conflict to normalization, to this new elevated status,\" he said. The partnership with Vietnam is part of the Biden administration's push \"to demonstrate to our our Indo-Pacific partners and to the world, the United States is a Pacific nation and we're not going anywhere,\" Biden told reporters after the meeting in Hanoi. Vietnam is navigating frosty relations between Washington and Beijing as the tech and textile exporter seeks its own foothold in the international competition to be a low-cost manufacturing hub. Top Chinese officials, possibly including President Xi Jinping, are expected to visit Vietnam in the coming days or weeks, officials and diplomats said, as Hanoi seeks to maintain good relations with all super powers. Biden also said in Hanoi he had talked with Xi's deputy at the G20, and that the two talked about stability. Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, 79, remarked on the 80-year-old U.S. president's appearance inside party headquarters, saying \"You have nary aged a day and I would say you look even better than before.\" Vietnam's longstanding relationship with Russia faces tests over the war in Ukraine, including talks with Moscow over a new arms supply deal that could trigger U.S. sanctions. Reuters has seen documents describing talks for a credit facility that Russia would extend to Vietnam to buy heavy weaponry, including anti-ship missiles, antisubmarine aircraft and helicopters, antiaircraft missile systems and fighter jets. One of them, a letter sent in May by Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh to the Russian government, showed interest in the possible new deal. A Vietnamese military officer confirmed the authenticity of the letter and the talks for a new $8 billion credit facility to buy heavy weaponry. A spokesperson for Vietnam's foreign ministry did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the documents, which show Moscow pushing for months for a loan deal that would bypass Western sanctions on Moscow. Hanoi is in similar talks with multiple arms suppliers, including the United States. In recent weeks, Vietnam has engaged in several high-level defence meetings with top Russian officials. The U.S.- Vietnam upgrade will include a security dimension, Jon Finer, the U.S. principal deputy national security adviser, told reporters on Sunday, while on the plane with Biden to Vietnam from a Group of 20 summit in India. He said he had no arms deals to announce at this stage but stressed that the U.S. and its partners could offer Vietnam help to diversify away from Russian military supplies, an offer which he said Vietnam was receptive to. That would help Vietnam reduce military reliance on Moscow, \"a relationship we think they are increasingly uncomfortable with,\" Finer said. Biden's visit comes as bilateral trade and investment ties are growing and a long-simmering territorial dispute between Vietnam and China heats up in the South China Sea. Vietnam Airlines (HVN.HM)New Tab is expected to sign an initial agreement to buy about 50 Boeing (BA.N) 737 Max jets in a deal valued at $10 billion, timed to the trip. Highlighting Vietnam's growing importance as a \"friendshoring\" destination for U.S. technology companies, executives from Google (GOOGL.O)New Tab , Intel (INTC.O)New Tab , Amkor (AMKR.O)New Tab , Marvell (MRVL.O)New Tab , GlobalFoundries (GFS.O)New Tab and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab are expected to meet on Monday with Vietnamese tech executives and Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Hanoi. Still, semiconductors are the centrepiece of an action plan adopted during Biden's visit, U.S. officials said. Besides possible announcements by U.S. corporations, it is unclear what else the the partnership could mean. The US government has $100 million a year for five years available under the CHIPS Act to support semiconductor supply chains globally. A large part of it could go to Vietnam, officials said. More support to train skilled workers is also part of the deal, as Vietnam faces a major shortage of engineers in the chips sector. Another key issue is strengthening supply chains of critical minerals, especially rare earths, of which Vietnam has the world's largest deposits after China, according to U.S. estimates, officials said. Two people familiar with the plans said an agreement on rare earths was expected during Biden's visit, which ends on Monday when he flies back to America. Details, however, are scant. Past attempts by U.S. companies to partner with Vietnamese rare earth firms have not succeeded, according to a person involved in one recent plan. Human rights remain a controversial issue, with U.S. officials regularly criticising Hanoi for jailing activists and limiting freedom of expression. Vietnam may show goodwill, with diplomats suggesting activists could be freed.",

            "text": "Boeing's (BA.N)New Tab first delivery of the 737 MAX 7 has been delayed to 2024, the company said in an SEC filing on Wednesday. Boeing still expects the Federal Aviation Administration to certify the MAX 7 and begin FAA certification flight testing for the MAX 10 in 2023, the company said. MAX 10 is currently slated for first delivery in 2024. Both the MAX 7 and MAX 10 are seen as critical for Boeing to compete against Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab for orders at the top and bottom of the narrowbody markets. A delay in getting the MAX 7 to launch customer Southwest Airlines (LUV.N)New Tab will further draw out its entry into service, originally set for 2022, and could hinder the carrier's expansion, as it exclusively operates the 737. Boeing shares were up 7.7% on Wednesday afternoon on the strength of second quarter-results that beat Wall Street consensus. Boeing and the FAA have been going back and forth on the safety management system paperwork for months needed to get the MAX 7 certified and there is no clear timetable when the FAA might be able to sign off on Boeing’s submissions, sources told Reuters. \"Safety dictates the timeline of certification projects. We cannot discuss ongoing certification projects,\" the FAA said in a statement. Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun had said in January the company thinks \"first delivery for the 7 will be this year and probably for the 10 the next year.\" But in May, Mike Fleming, Boeing's senior vice president for commercial development programs, said that MAX 7 certification was taking a \"considerable amount of time\" due to new documentation requirements. The MAX 10 is the Boeing’s answer to Airbus’ wildly-successful A321 neo, which has dominated in competitions against the MAX 9, while the smaller MAX 7 competes against Airbus’ A220. Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said in March that he didn't anticipate putting the MAX 7 into service in 2023, as the process could take six months from delivery, and that an early 2024 entry into service was the best case scenario. Last month, Alaska Airlines (ALK.N)New Tab CEO Ben Minicucci told Reuters the airline is \"anxious\" to begin taking deliveries of the larger Boeing 737 MAX 10 to help it carry more passengers once the plane is certified. Boeing must first win approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for its smaller MAX 7 before it can get approval for the MAX 10. Both variants have faced major delays amid more intense regulatory scrutiny after criticism of the earlier certification process for the MAX 8, which suffered fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.",

Acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen in a \"call to action\" memo on Tuesday seen by Reuters said the safety review team will \"examine the U.S. aerospace system’s structure, culture, processes, systems, and integration of safety efforts.\" The FAA will hold a safety summit in March to examine what additional actions \"the aviation community needs to take to maintain our safety record.\" Nolen, who is set to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday, said a group of commercial and general aviation leaders, labor partners, and others \"will examine which mitigations are working and why others appear to be not as effective as they once were.\" The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating a series of serious close calls including a near collision last month between FedEx (FDX.N)New Tab and Southwest Airlines (LUV.N)New Tab planes in Austin and a runway incursion at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. On Tuesday, the NTSB said it would investigate a Dec. 18 incident in which United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab Flight 777, a Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 777 jet, lost significant altitude before recovering shortly after departing Kahului, Hawaii. In January, the FAA halted all departing passenger airline flights for nearly two hours because of a computer outage, the first nationwide ground stop of its kind since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The United States has not had a major fatal U.S. passenger airline crash since February 2009. \"We are experiencing the safest period in aviation history, but we cannot take this for granted,\" Nolen wrote. \"Recent events remind us that we must not become complacent. Now is the time to stare into the data and ask hard questions.\" Nolen asked the FAA Commercial Aviation Safety Team to take a new look at Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing data \"to see whether there are other incidents that resemble ones we have seen in recent weeks.\" The review team will focus on the Air Traffic Organization and assess its internal processes, systems, and operational integration, Nolen said. Association of Flight Attendants President Sara Nelson praised Nolen's announcement. \"U.S. aviation is the safest transportation system in the world. But we cannot ever rest. It takes constant vigilance and engagement of all stakeholders in our collective responsibility to safety,\" Nelson said.",

Warren East, overseeing his last trading update before he retires after seven years, said that the company was continuing to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and that cuts made at the time had positioned it well for the uncertain economic environment. He hands over to former BP executive Tufan Erginbilgic at the end of the year, who must wrestle with Rolls's COVID-19 debts of 4 billion pounds ($4.50 billion) and a civil aerospace unit which is still being affected by travel restrictions in China. Shares in Rolls-Royce fell 5% in mid-morning deals. It said it was targeting low-to-mid-single digit underlying revenue growth, a profit margin broadly in line with last year's 3.8% level and modestly positive cash flow. The stock had risen 10% in the week ahead of the update but is down 36% this year. \"Rolls Royce is doing all it can within its control,\" said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Sophie Lund-Yates. \"The trouble is, and which has been the case since the pandemic struck, the group's grappling against a multitude of headwinds from external forces.\" Like all manufacturers, Rolls-Royce, whose engines power the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787, is also facing higher input costs. In Britain, it said it agreed a 6.5% wage increase and additional 1,500 pound payment for staff represented by unions. Rolls said it aims to recover the higher costs through efficiency gains and higher prices and that higher stock levels, as a result of supply chain pressures, would not affect its ability to meet forecasts. Aero-engine maker General Electric (GE.N)New Tab has also noted supply chain strains, specifically in obtaining castings from suppliers, while planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab has said that the global supply chain remains a \"very degraded environment\" following the pandemic.

The company also raised its full-year forecasts for revenue and profit as the Ukraine war drives up demand for defense equipment. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and some other lawmakers had urged the Defense Department to thoroughly review the proposed deal, saying it could impact the operations of Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Boeing - all of which depend on products that only Aerojet is able to produce. Aerojet makes liquid and solid rocket propulsion and hypersonic engines for space, defense, civil and commercial applications. L3Harris, which announced it would buy Aerojet in December, said it expects to close the deal on or about July 28. The FTC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. With the Ukraine war driving up demand for missiles and defense systems, Aerojet became an attractive takeover target. In 2022, Lockheed Martin (LMT.N)New Tab walked away from its deal with Aerojet after antitrust regulators sued to block it on competition concerns. On Wednesday, L3Harris raised its annual revenue forecast to between $18 billion and $18.3 billion, from $17.4 billion to $17.8 billion estimated earlier. L3Harris now expects profit to be between $12.15 and $12.55 per share, from $12 to $12.50 estimated earlier.

The deals reflect growing interest in battery-powered aircraft that can take off and land vertically, offering a new way for travellers to beat traffic and hop between cities. Vertical's VA-X4 has a range of 120 miles but that could be extended further, Avolon Chief Executive Domhnal Slattery said on late Thursday. \"The challenge for incumbent (planemakers) is if the range can extend to 400-500 miles, what is the implication for traditional narrowbodies?\" he said in a Reuters interview. Asked if the vehicles for four passengers and a pilot could take business from much larger commercial planes, Slattery said, \"Eventually, yes of course. This is the inevitable future.\" Planemakers have themselves invested in such projects. PARTNERSHIPS Helicopter travel could also be squeezed. \"You have got to think that you have these machines that can disintermediate the legacy helicopters through just being 100 times quieter and no emissions,\" Slattery said. Avolon has placed a firm order for 310 eVTOLs worth $1.25 billion and 190 options worth $750 million, Slattery said. They will join an owned or managed fleet of 568 passenger aircraft all the way up to the 396-seat Boeing 777-300ER. Slattery said Avolon had not decided how to deploy the air taxis, whose relatively short product development cycles mark a shift for leasing companies used to long-term jet investments. \"We could partner with airlines, we could establish our own entities in different jurisdictions around the world, we could partner with helicopter operators,\" Slattery said. \"I think it is going to take a lot of different forms over time. But the technology is here and we are going to lead commercialisation of it with zero-emission credentials\". The move comes at a time when aviation companies are jostling for leadership of the environmental agenda as they came under pressure from investors to help decarbonise flying and bolster their environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores. Vertical Aerospace says eVTOL aircraft can help the industry meet carbon reduction goals through zero emissions and electrical power, where possible derived from renewable energy. But experts say questions remain over the timing of safety certification, which eVOTL suppliers expect as early as 2024.",

            "text": "A rift between Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and engine makers over plans for higher jet output blotted strong aerospace earnings this week, with worries over the supply chain's industrial capacity masking a deeper tug of war over contrasting business strategies. With travel demand snapping back in key U.S. and Chinese markets, Airbus wants to almost double jet production in a few years as it capitalises on a bulging order book for new jets and the recent woes of embattled U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N)New Tab . In May, it issued a mix of firm targets and scenarios that could lift narrowbody output to 75 jets a month by 2025 from 40 now, and 60 before the COVID pandemic. read more That has rattled engine makers and others who fear the world's largest planemaker will upset their own recovery by flooding markets with new jets too quickly, forcing existing ones straight into retirement rather than their repair shops. \"The engine makers look at the production plans and see them displacing older airplanes that are still profitable for them,\" said Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia. The standoff could accelerate efforts by engine makers to adapt their service-dependent business models by charging more upfront for their engines, Aboulafia said. Doing so is potentially risky since planemakers also eye a bigger slice of their suppliers' service revenues. Public differences over production can unsettle the whole supply chain, reducing the appetite for risk, suppliers say. Few quibble with a smooth return towards pre-crisis levels for in-demand narrowbody jets, through Boeing remains more cautious as it emerges from a separate crisis over its 737 MAX. \"They (planemakers) can feel the momentum coming back,\" the head of the world's largest engine maker GE Aviation, John Slattery, told a Eurocontrol podcast, while pledging to support a return to pre-crisis levels by early 2023 for narrowbodies. But industry sources say GE's French engine partner Safran (SAF.PA)New Tab was speaking for many suppliers when it questioned plans to take output swiftly beyond that to uncharted levels. \"I have to say we are not sure that the market has the appetite for such rates and that rates well above 60 can be sustainable,\" Safran CEO Olivier Andries told analysts on Wednesday, echoing previous warnings against over-production. Also speaking to analysts at mid-year results, Greg Hayes, CEO of Pratt & Whitney parent Raytheon Technologies (RTX.N)New Tab , expressed surprise at \"pretty aggressive\" Airbus output plans. Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury defended the plans, saying he was ready to \"do the math\" with suppliers based on solid orders. \"I'm really disappointed to see that some usual partners are still challenging the rates,\" he told analysts. In public, the debate revolves around the resilience of both demand and a weakened supply chain. Behind the scenes, the argument aggravates differences that have been simmering for years, some industry sources said. \"There is a legitimate point to make about the industrial worries and appetite for risk among lower-tier suppliers. But it is also legitimate to say that engine makers have to get work out of airplanes already in service,\" one industry source said. SPLIT BUSINESS MODELS Both jetmakers and engine makers have reaped a bonanza from demand for popular narrowbodies used by low-cost carriers, but the way they recoup their investments is generally different. While planemakers get paid on delivery of new jets, allowing them to absorb fixed costs fairly quickly, engine makers rely on servicing older jets and have to wait years to make money back. Until now, a strong economy left room for both models and supported record new jet orders while keeping older planes flying long enough to generate lucrative service visits. But Airbus' plans have triggered disagreement over how the burden of the crisis should be shared. Engine makers already face delays in future parts revenues, because the maintenance clock has paused on thousands of jets idled during the crisis. \"It is rather surprising to see production going to the highest levels ever seen while the number of stored airplanes is also at the highest level ever seen,\" one industry source said. CFM, a GE-Safran (GE.N)New Tab venture which powers all Boeing and some Airbus narrowbody jets, and Pratt & Whitney (RTX.N)New Tab , which competes with CFM on Airbus jets, have voiced private concerns over the long-term impact of the plans, industry sources said. CFM, Pratt & Whitney and Airbus declined to comment. As sole supplier on the 737 MAX, which was hit by a recent safety crisis, CFM will also be wary of the signal it sends to the U.S. company if it helps Airbus assume too flamboyant a lead in the market with its A320neo family, one industry source said. Planemakers say they are the primary risk takers and argue the whole industry has feasted off demand for their products. They argue that although engine makers see their margins diluted in the short-term by delivering engines for little or no immediate cash, they reap high margins on later repairs. Tensions over production are just one threat to a fragile balance between business models in the $150 billion jet sector. Airlines are also under pressure to retire jets sooner for environmental reasons, sometimes in return for COVID bailouts. That too could reduce the number of prized engine overhauls. A trend towards shorter lifespans was revealed in recent climate reports from Airbus and Boeing, calculating emissions from their jets based on a life around 22 years. read more That's lower than the mantra of 25 years underpinning a growing air finance industry and has potential implications for aircraft prices, leasing profits and future airplane orders. \"The market is going to dictate how many engines the engine makers will produce,\" Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said in a recent interview. \"Ultimately I think you are seeing a convergence in the number of engines and airframes being produced.\"",

Australia, to date the only non-U.S. customer for the remotely piloted high-altitude, long-endurance aircraft, has so far ordered three to compliment its fleet of crewed Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab P-8A Poseidon planes. The first Australian aircraft was unveiled in California on Wednesday. It is due for delivery in mid-2024, and will be based primarily in Australia's tropical north but controlled from a base near the southern city of Adelaide. Australia has been boosting its defence spending over the past few years as China steps up its presence in the Indo-Pacific region. Last year, Australia agreed to buy nuclear submarines from the United States and Britain. read more The new centre-left government last month announced a defence strategic review due in early 2023. RAAF Head of Air Force Capability Air Vice-Marshal Robert Denney said at the Triton unveiling ceremony that the final number to be purchased would be decided after the review was completed. \"That defence review will take into consideration the decision not to proceed on SkyGuardian,\" he said, referring to Australia this year scrapping plans to buy up to 12 General Atomics-built MQ-9B armed medium-altitude long-endurance drones. The addition of Triton will allow Australia's crewed P-8 planes to focus on anti-submarine warfare (ASW) rather than splitting their time between that and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), said Doug Shaffer, Northrop Grumman vice president autonomous ISR and targeting programmes. \"So a Navy maritime patrol gets 10 times more ISR and they free up the P-8 to focus on the ASW mission, so you get three times more ASW capability,\" he said in an interview. \"That is really the force multiplier by having a manned-unmanned teaming.\" The U.S. Navy, which also has P-8s, has deployed Triton from Guam and Japan.",

            "text": "Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab voiced optimism on Monday about sales of a new A350 freighter after Boeing (BA.N)New Tab launched a competing cargo version of its future 777X jetliner and said it was doing everything possible to shore up fragile global supply chains. Airbus launched the freighter version of its A350 wide-body jet last year to address rising air cargo demand and penetrate a profitable part of the jet market dominated by Boeing, which hit back with a 777X freighter launch order from Qatar Airways. \"Yes, you can expect to see more orders for the A350 freighter,\" Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said ahead of the Singapore Airshow which runs from Feb. 15-18, but declined to elaborate. Provisional customers for the A350 freighter include Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI)New Tab which could confirm a provisional order to coincide with this week's air show, delegates said. The airline signed a tentative deal in December to buy seven A350 freighters and become its first major airline operator. But the deal also involves dropping previous orders for 15 A320neo jets and two A350-900 passenger versions. Both Airbus and Boeing have agreed to convert some passenger plane orders in order to secure wins for their new twin-engined freighters. Scherer declined comment on a dispute with Qatar Airways which has led the Gulf carrier to refuse to consider buying the A350 freighter and back Boeing's 777X cargo version. It has also placed a provisional order for at least 25 Boeing 737 MAX jets, after Airbus revoked an order for A321neos as part of the same dispute over surface damage to A350 jets. Scherer played down industry concerns over supply chains when asked whether Russian titanium could be swept up in any tit-for-tat sanctions resulting from tensions over Ukraine. \"Fundamentally, we are not concerned about the structural issue,\" Scherer said. Industry sources have said Airbus and Boeing have increased stocks of the strategically important metal, of which Russia is the largest producer. read more Asked whether broader supply chain problems could also hamper Airbus' plans to increase jetliner production, he said, \"we are doing everything we can for that not to be the case.\" Boeing also indicated on Monday it was not concerned about Russian titanium supplies, but said it was keeping a close watch on other pinch points. read more Concerns over the Ukraine crisis hit European shares on Monday, with Airbus down 3% and major airlines falling 6%. Planemakers are gathering for Asia's largest aerospace event, whose attendance has been hit by COVID-19 restrictions. Airbus said it had firmed up previously tentative orders for 20 A220 small jets from leasing company Aviation Capital Group, a subsidiary of Tokyo Century Corp, and 28 A320neos from Kuwaiti carrier Jazeera Airways. Airlines have been rushing to buy such jets again as some markets recover, though long-haul travel remains depressed. Analysts say one exception has been China, which has been notably quiet as U.S.-China trade tensions cast a pall over its demand for Boeing jets, spilling over to affect demand for Airbus as planners avoided all politically sensitive purchases. Scherer noted the risk that China could miss out on available airplanes as other airlines fill the gap. Usually China accounts for about a quarter of global purchases. \"We are still hopeful to be able to include additional transactions by Chinese customers,\" Scherer said. \"Notwithstanding the pandemic crisis, we've continued to sell very successfully...so there's a lot of pressure now on our friends in China to come to the party or run the risk of seeing not enough capacity to satisfy their needs. But I remain optimistic that China will come back to an ordinary cycle.\" Airbus also hopes China will soon certify its A220 jet.",

            "text": "Qatar Airways took a spiralling $4 million-a-day dispute with Europe's Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab to social media on Friday, publishing a video of the scarred exterior of grounded A350 jets that the airline said underscored \"serious and legitimate safety concerns.\" The two companies have been locked for months in a dispute over deterioration to paint and anti-lightning protection on the long-haul jets, which Airbus has acknowledged needs attention while insisting it does not put safety at risk. Qatar Airways hit back with the first official images of jets grounded by its national regulator in a bid to keep the spotlight on technical matters after Airbus accused the state-owned airline of engineering the dispute to obtain compensation. The dispute has led to the grounding of 21 planes out of 53 A350s operated by Qatar Airways and cast a pall over the airline's preparations for the World Cup later this year. The airline says it needs planes to accommodate thousands of fans. It has also prompted Qatar Airways to exclude Airbus from a multi-billion-dollar deal to replace almost three dozen freighters, which is expected to go to rival Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and could help bolster ties with Washington in an upcoming visit. Qatar Airways is pressing for compensation of $618 million plus $4 million a day and halted taking new A350 deliveries. Airbus has said it will fight the claim in full. In the video lasting just over a minute and a half released on YouTube, Qatar Airways showed rows of defects on the skin of some of the A350s grounded by the country's regulator. Airbus had no immediate comment on the video. Airbus has said there is \"no reasonable or rational basis\" for the groundings, which have not happened elsewhere. read more The clip showed areas of peeling or missing paint, cracks and damage to anti-lightning protection, as well as what the airline described as patches of carbon-fibre that were exposed to moisture and potentially damaging ultra-violet light. The lightweight carbon-fibre jetliner relies on metallic foil embedded beneath the paint to help lightning wash safely over the fuselage, which is less conductive than earlier metal. Lightning strikes jetliners about once a year. The video showed flakes of the copper-mesh anti-lightning system, which is supposed to be fixed to the plane with resin, coming loose when paint was teased away by a gloved hand. The images echoed damage to A350s first revealed in pictures exclusivelyNew Tab published in a Reuters investigation last November. The investigation showed that at least five other airlines had reported A350 paint or skin flaws since 2016, well before Qatar raised concerns in November 2020 when an attempt to repaint a jet in World Cup livery exposed some 980 defects. \"We continue to strongly believe that Airbus must undertake a thorough investigation of this condition to conclusively establish its full root cause,\" Qatar Airways said. Airbus has said that it is looking at changing the design of anti-lightning mesh for future A350s, but insists there is adequate backup lightning protection. It says Qatar is undermining global protocols by seeking leverage over safety. The question of whether a \"root-cause analysis\" exists is part of a UK court case due for a hearing in late April. Airbus says it has provided the relevant information and concluded that there is no airworthiness risk, a view echoed by Europe's air regulator. The jet video capped 24 hours of intense exposure for the usually secretive aviation world after Airbus took the rare step of revoking a separate Qatar order for smaller A321neos. Qatar Airways indicated it would fight the move, saying it was upholding all its current contracts. The jet has been a major success for Airbus which faces problems in keeping up with demand. \"The opportunity cost to Airbus (of cancelling) is zero; it may even be convenient,\" said consultant Bertrand Grabowski.",

            "text": "General Electric Co (GE.N)New Tab on Tuesday raised its full-year profit outlook after quarterly earnings topped Wall Street estimates on robust demand for jet engine spare parts and services from airlines looking to cash in on surging air travel. The company's shares were up about 6% at $116.44 in morning trade. CEO Larry Culp in an interview said the company has not seen any signs of softening in demand despite rising interest rates. \"We feel very good about the demand that we see broadly,\" he said. A faster-than-expected recovery in aviation from pandemic lows has lifted results of engine makers as shortages of commercial planes have forced airlines to use old jets for longer, boosting demand for lucrative aftermarket services. GE's aerospace unit, which makes engines for jets of Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab and Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab , posted double-digit growth in orders, revenue and operating profit from a year earlier. Its services revenue was up 31% in the second quarter from a year ago. Services accounted for 70% of the unit's revenue last year. The company also reported growth in deliveries of LEAP engines, which it produces in a joint venture with France's Safran (SAF.PA)New Tab . Culp said while supply-chain constraints are improving, the company needs to do more to keep up with \"unprecedented\" production ramp-up at Boeing and Airbus. He reaffirmed the company's forecast to deliver 1,700 LEAP engine units this year. GE is also seeing a moderation in cost pressures, he said. Its aerospace unit will carry out a price increase for parts in August, Culp added. The Boston-based industrial conglomerate now expects 2023 adjusted profit per share of $2.10 to $2.30, compared with its previous forecast of $1.70 to $2.00. The outlook compares with analysts' consensus earnings estimate of $2.06 per share for 2023, according to a Refinitiv survey. Free cash flow for the year is estimated to be in a range of $4.1 billion to $4.6 billion, up from $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion expected previously. GE said operating profit at its aerospace business was now expected to be in a range of $5.6 billion to $5.9 billion this year, up from $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion estimated earlier. In a sign of improvement at its renewable energy business, the company said the unit was expected to post stronger revenue than its previous estimate, translating into \"significantly\" better operating profit in 2023. GE's adjusted profit for the June quarter came in at 68 cents per share, compared with a profit of 46 cents per share estimated by analysts in a Refinitiv survey.",

            "text": "Launch teams at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida spent a final full day of preparations ahead of Monday's planned liftoff of NASA's giant next-generation rocket on its debut test flight, kicking off the agency's Artemis moon-to-Mars program 50 years after the end of the Apollo era. NASA officials said on Sunday that all systems appeared \"go\" for liftoff, and weather forecasts called for an 80% chance of favorable conditions at the top of Monday's two-hour launch window, starting at 8:33 a.m. EDT (1233 GMT), diminishing to 60% toward the end of that period. If the countdown clock is halted for any reason, NASA has set Sept. 2 and Sept. 5 as potential backup launch dates. \"Everything to date looks good from a vehicle perspective,\" said Jeff Spaulding, senior NASA test director for the landmark mission, called Artemis I. \"We are excited, the vehicle is ready, it looks great.\" Although lightning rods at the launch site were struck during a storm on Saturday, Spaulding said he has not \"seen anything on the ground systems that give us any concerns.\" NASA said there was no damage to the spacecraft or launch facilities. The Space Launch System (SLS) rocket is set to propel an uncrewed capsule named Orion around the moon and back on a six-week test flight designed to put both vehicles through their paces before flying astronauts in a subsequent mission targeted for 2024. The SLS-Orion combo, standing 322 feet (98 meters) tall, form the centerpiece of the U.S. space agency's successor to the Apollo moon program of the 1960s and 1970s. Billed as the most powerful, complex rocket in the world, the SLS represents the biggest new vertical launch system NASA has built since the Saturn V flown for Apollo, which grew out of the U.S.-Soviet space race of the Cold War era. If the first two Artemis missions succeed, NASA is aiming to land astronauts back on the moon, including the first woman to set foot on the lunar surface, as early as 2025, though many experts believe that time frame is likely to slip by a few years. The last humans to walk on the moon were the two-man descent team of Apollo 17 in 1972, following in the footsteps of 10 other astronauts during five earlier missions beginning with Apollo 11 in 1969. The Artemis program seeks to eventually establish a long-term lunar base as a stepping stone to even more ambitious astronaut voyages to Mars, a goal that NASA officials have said will probably take until at least the late 2030s to achieve. SLS has been under development for more than a decade, with years of delays and cost overruns. But the Artemis program also has generated tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in commerce under the primary contractors Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab for SLS and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N)New Tab for Orion. One issue NASA officials were eyeing on Sunday before the maiden flight of SLS concerned a potential - but minor - helium leak in launch pad equipment, though Spaulding told reporters during a launch-eve news conference that he did not expect any technical show-stoppers to the countdown. \"This is a test flight, remember that,\" NASA chief Bill Nelson said in a Reuters interview that was interrupted by an unexpected phone call from U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, who will be in Florida to see the rocket launch in person. \"She's excited!\" Nelson said after the call.",

            "text": "The United States and the European Union have agreed a truce in their near 17-year conflict over aircraft subsidies, suspending for five years one set of Trump-era tariffs which had soured relations between them. The two sides have been battling since 2004 in parallel cases at the World Trade Organization over subsidies for U.S. planemaker Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and European rival Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab , which each argued exposed the other to unfair competition. They agreed in March to a four-month suspension of tariffs on $11.5 billion of goods from EU cheese and wine to U.S. tobacco and spirits, which the WTO had sanctioned. Businesses have so far paid more than $3.3 billion in duties. On Tuesday they said they would suspend the tariffs for five years, in line with a Reuters report on Monday read more , while still working on the overarching agreement on subsidies they had envisaged in March. \"Grounding the Airbus-Boeing dispute delivers a major confidence boost for EU-U.S. relations,\" EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference after an EU-U.S. summit with U.S. President Joe Biden. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the two sides had agreed to clear statements on what support could be given to large civil aircraft producers. They would also work to counter investments in aircraft by \"non-market actors\", she said, referring specifically to China. Others were launching their own industries and the United States and the EU had been too busy fighting each other to pay attention, she said. \"The deal...includes a commitment for concrete joint collaboration to confront the threat from China's ambitions to build an aircraft sector on non-market practices,\" she said. Both sides said they were confident the Airbus/Boeing dispute would indeed end within five years. The United States and the European Union have agreed to set up a working group on the issue, provide financing on market terms, be transparent on R&D funding, avoid support that would harm the other side and cooperate to address \"non-market practices\" elsewhere. Airbus said the deal levelled the playing field and ended \"lose-lose\" tariffs, which had also been imposed on planes. Boeing said the understanding committed the EU to address launch aid. Biden welcomed the \"major breakthrough\", as did ministers of France and Germany, both with Airbus facilities. WTO director-general Ngozi Okonjo said she was delighted the two sides had shown seemingly intractable problems could be resolved. Shares of Airbus and Boeing traded slightly higher on the day. BRITAIN WAITS, STEEL DISPUTE LINGERS Former EU member Britain, which was also involved in the dispute as a home to Airbus production, said it hoped for a similar deal within days. Tai is due to meet her British counterpart Liz Truss on Wednesday. The EU-U.S. agreement removes one of two major trade irritants left over from Donald Trump's presidency, the other being tariffs imposed on grounds of national security on EU steel and aluminium imports. The European Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, last month suspended for up to six months a threatened June 1 doubling of retaliatory tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorbikes, U.S. whiskey and motorboats, and refrained from slapping tariffs on more U.S. products from lipstick to sports shoes. Brussels and Washington have said they would seek to address excess global steel capacity largely centred in China. The United States may find it tougher to remove the metals tariffs, which also apply to other countries such as China, because they are still backed by many U.S. metal producers and workers. An EU official said the two sides had a \"robust\" discussion on metals, with disagreement on the rationale for the tariffs. The EU hopes to resolve the issue by December. Brussels is also pushing what it dubs a new \"positive agenda\" on trade with Washington, including forging an alliance to drive WTO reform. The two also agreed to cooperate on trade and technology, such as for setting compatible standards and facilitating trade in artificial intelligence.",

The order includes 25 of the 737 MAX 10 variant which Boeing is battling to get certified ahead of an end-year deadline. It also includes 25 737-8200 variants in a deal whose total value is pegged at $6.25 billion at official list prices, before widespread industry discounts that can exceed 50%. IAG, which also owns Ireland's Aer Lingus and Spain's Iberia and Vueling, has a further 100 purchase options as part of the deal, which is subject to shareholder approval. \"The addition of new Boeing 737s is an important part of IAG's short-haul fleet renewal,\" IAG Chief Executive Luis Gallego said in a statement. Boeing shares rose 0.8% against a slightly weaker market. IAG stunned the industry when it struck a tentative deal for 200 Boeing 737 MAX jets at the Paris Airshow in 2019 at a time when the MAX was grounded worldwide in the wake of two fatal crashes. The global outbreak of COVID-19 early the following year caused that deal - intended as a show of confidence in troubled Boeing by then-IAG boss Willie Walsh - to lapse, and the airline group later started a formal contest between Boeing and Airbus. The deal \"provides a much needed booster shot of confidence\" for Boeing, Susannah Streeter, senior analyst at UK brokerage Hargreaves Lansdown, wrote in a note to investors. In particular, the firm 737 MAX 10 order from a top-tier customer is an important signal to the market at a time when Boeing faces a high-stakes battle to win certification of the largest MAX variant before year-end, analysts said. read more The partial poaching, or \"flip,\" of an Airbus fleet in Boeing's favour comes months after the European firm won campaigns to oust Boeing at Dutch KLM and Australia's Qantas in a fierce sales war between the two plane giants. The MAX 10 competes at the top end of the single-aisle market recently dominated by Airbus. Boeing's financial health hinges on the resumption of deliveries of 787 Dreamliners and clearing MAX inventories. The head of Germany's Lufthansa (LHAG.DE)New Tab predicted on Thursday that Boeing would \"get back to its feet.\" read more Reuters in February reported IAG was likely to preserve part of the tentative MAX commitment with an order involving closer to 50 jets rather than the original 200, while also splitting its requirements and ordering Airbus jets. read more IAG continues to negotiate with Airbus for an order of roughly the same size, industry sources said on Thursday. Talks also continue inside the airline about which parts of the network will use the MAX, which is most suited to operations at London's Gatwick airport that do not require containers for cargo, they said. IAG said the planes, to be delivered between 2023 and 2027, \"can be used by any airline in the group for fleet replacement\".",

            "text": "Alaska Air Group (ALK.N)New Tab , the operator of the Boeing plane that suffered a mid-air incident earlier this month, said on Thursday it expects a $150-million profit hit in 2024 from the more-than-two-week-long grounding of 737 MAX 9 aircraft. Earlier this month, an Alaska 737 MAX 9 aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing after a cabin panel fell off during a flight full of passengers. The Federal Aviation Administration subsequently grounded over 170 MAX 9 jets across carriers. Including the impact, the airline forecast 2024 adjusted earnings per share to be between $3.00 and $5.00. Analysts polled by LSEG had expected a profit of $4.93 this year. Alaska also cast doubt on its capacity growth target of 3% to 5% this year, saying: \"Given the grounding, and the potential for future delivery delays, the Company expects capacity growth to be at or below the lower end of this range.\" The airline swung to a fourth-quarter loss, from a year-ago profit, hurt by an increase in fuel and labor expenses. The U.S. aviation regulator lifted the grounding on Wednesday, but also barred Boeing from expanding production of its best-selling 737 MAX narrowbody planes, which is expected to have wide-ranging effects across the industry. Alaska executives are set to address investors and analysts later in the day. The airline placed ordersNew Tab for 42 737-10 and 10 737-9 jets in 2022, as part of a plan to sunset Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab aircraft by the end of 2023. Alaska and United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab together account for 70% of Boeing's MAX 9 fleet and had been forced to cancel thousands of flights in the wake of the incident. Alaska saidNew Tab it expects to bring the first few planes back into service on Friday and that it discovered and immediately corrected a minor fault on one 737-900ER plane after an FAA-recommended inspection as part of its scrutiny of Boeing. The groundings had no impact on the company's results for the October-December quarter, during which its revenue rose nearly 3%, to $2.55 billion, due to strong travel demand. However, an increase in labor and fuel-related costs pushed Alaska to a loss of $2 million, or 2 cents per share for the quarter, from a profit of $22 million, or 17 cents per share, a year ago.",

Europe's largest budget carrier halted negotiations for at least 100 Boeing 737 MAX 10 jets in a pricing dispute towards the end of the COVID-19 crisis some 18 months ago. Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Wednesday Ryanair was now considering the 200-seat 737 MAX 8200 and the 230-seat 737 MAX 10 \"as long as the price parameters are acceptable\". A potential deal for 100 planes, plus 100 options, is likely to take several months to negotiate, he told Reuters on the sidelines of an A4E airline conference in Brussels. Boeing shares were up 1% at mid-session in New York. He also said he expected the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to certify the 737 MAX 7, Boeing's smallest model, in the first half of 2023 and the MAX 10 to win approval from U.S. regulators towards the end of this year. Ryanair is one of Boeing's largest customers and is seen as one of a handful of airlines that can insist on the best prices in their region, alongside U.S. carrier Southwest Airlines. In late 2021, O'Leary accused Boeing of trying to impose a \"delusionary\" price increase and declared a \"marital rift\" between the Irish carrier and its long-time sole supplier. Boeing said at the time it valued Ryanair's business but had to exercise discipline. On Wednesday, it declined comment. Industry sources had said the breakdown was a test of two competing views on the speed of the post-COVID recovery, with Boeing gaining confidence from renewed sales of the MAX following a safety crisis and Ryanair prepared to wait it out. O'Leary told the Financial Times last week that talks had resumed. On Wednesday, O'Leary said the breakthrough came after Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun and Stan Deal, head of its commercial division, approached Ryanair two months ago. \"They are back talking to us; I think it takes maybe six, nine months to get a deal done,\" he added. The Ryanair CEO voiced support for Calhoun and said he hoped Boeing's management would stabilise \"over a number of years\", adding the company had been through a rough period of delays. \"I think Calhoun is putting together a good team and we would like to see that team stabilise over a number of years, and we could get back to kind of normal for doing business relations,\" he said.

The plane with five crew members safely returned and no injuries were reported. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating. The FAA said a post-flight inspection showed a softball-size hole above the engine, while the NTSB said it \"has opened an investigation and is collecting information to evaluate and determine scope of the investigation.\" Unverified videos on social media platform X showed flames shooting out of the left wing of the aircraft while in flight. \"The crew followed all standard procedures and safely returned to (Miami International),\" the air freight company said, adding that it would conduct an inspection to find the cause. U.S. air safety expert John Cox said having problems with one engine is generally not a significant event, but the incident sounded like an uncontained engine failure due to the hole and NTSB investigation. “On the interior of that engine there are a lot of rotating parts including blades,\" Cox said. \"An engine is designed to try and contain a blade separation and they do testing and certification for it. But it does happen that you get an uncontained failure. When you do, it does elevate the investigative significance of it.\" Cox said incidents of uncontained engine failures, like a 2018 Southwest Airlines flight where a passenger was partially sucked out the window are coming under increased scrutiny. Investigators will be looking at questions like the age of the engine and its maintenance record. Boeing said it is supporting Atlas and \"the NTSB investigation into this incident.\" The Atlas Boeing 747-8 is eight years old, according to the FAA and is powered by four General Electric (GE.N)New Tab GEnx engines. GE Aerospace said it is providing technical assistance to the FAA and the NTSB. The engine failure comes against the backdrop of two high-profile jetliner accidents this year. An Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab A350 passenger plane operated by Japan Airlines collided with a Coast Guard aircraft in Tokyo, killing five crew members on Jan. 2. A few days later, a Boeing 737 MAX 9 jet made an emergency landing following a cabin panel blowout, which prompted the FAA to temporarily ground 171 jets for safety checks. The Atlas Air Flight was headed for San Juan, Puerto Rico, from Miami International Airport late on Thursday. The pilot made an emergency call to report an engine fire and requested to return to the airport, according to multi-channel recordings of conversations between air traffic control and the plane available on liveatc.net. \"We have a engine fire,\" one of the plane crew said, adding the fire occurred \"on the climb out\" of the airport. Atlas Air, customers of which include parcel delivery giants DHL and FedEx, went private last year when it was bought by a group led by private equity Apollo Global Management (APO.N)New Tab .

The latest boost to SpaceX's NASA contract is part of the agency's effort to ensure a steady run of astronaut flights to the space station as Boeing (BA.N)New Tab , the other company with a similar crew transportation contract, has struggled to complete development of its Starliner space capsule. The award \"allows NASA to maintain an uninterrupted U.S. capability for human access to the space station until 2030, with two unique commercial crew industry partners,\" the agency said in a statement. SpaceX and Boeing each won multibillion dollar NASA contracts in 2014 to develop, test and routinely fly space capsule systems capable of sending astronauts to and from the space station, an orbital research lab that has housed international crews of astronauts for over two decades. SpaceX's reusable Crew Dragon capsule has flown five crewed missions for NASA since it was crew-certified in 2020, when it became the first private company to launch humans into orbit and revived NASA's human spaceflight program after the U.S. shuttle program retired in 2011. Boeing's CST-100 Starliner capsule, beset by software glitches and valve malfunctions, aims to fly its first crew of astronauts in February next year, looking to pass a final test mission before NASA can certify the spacecraft for routine astronaut flights.

            "text": "Dubai carriers threw down the gauntlet to emerging regional rivals with more than $50 billion of Boeing jet orders on Monday, as competition intensifies to secure dwindling supplies of long-haul jets and anticipate growth in international travel. Government-owned Emirates and sister airline flyDubai secured 125 Boeing (BA.N)New Tab wide-body jets at the opening of the Dubai Airshow, but left Europe's Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab waiting for an order for broadly similar A350 jets. Orders included 55 of the 400-seat Boeing 777-9 and 35 of the smaller 777-8 in a boost for the over-arching programme known as 777X, which has been plagued by five years of delays. Emirates also took five extra 787 Dreamliners while flyDubai ordered 30 of the same type in its first ever long-haul order. \"Together these orders represent significant investments that reflect Dubai's commitment to the future of aviation,\" said Emirates and flyDubai Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum. He said Emirates expected to receive the 777X in 2025, which is in line with Boeing's latest target. Aviation and tourism industries are crucial to Dubai's economy, which lacks the oil wealth of many neighbouring states. In New York, Boeing shares rose 4.4% after the orders, which also included 45 narrow-body 737 MAX for German-Turkish airline SunExpress. Shares were also lifted by a Bloomberg report that talk this week between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping could end a prolonged freeze on Chinese 737 purchases. Medium-haul planes like the 737 MAX and competing Airbus A32neo drive planemaker and supplier profits globally. But the Gulf is the biggest customer for larger wide-body jets given the favourable geography of its UAE and Qatar hubs. Industry officials said latest orders raised the stakes as Saudi Arabia looks to establish its own footprint and Turkey and India forge plans to draw connecting traffic away from the Gulf. \"They (Dubai) are saying we are the big elephant in the room (and) demonstrating that they are a big player,\" Air Lease Corp (AL.N)New Tab Executive Chairman Steven F. Udvar-Hazy said. Industry officials estimate airlines worldwide are in talks to buy 700-800 new jets, including 200-300 wide-bodies, as they catch up on replacement plans set aside during the pandemic. But Udvar-Hazy questioned whether there was room for all the capacity being explored simultaneously by the region's carriers. \"They are fighting for the same passengers,\" he told Reuters. Analysts said tight supply chains also remained a concern. \"This is a multiple order and a lot of airplanes. The problem is that manufacturers can't make enough of them,\" said Bernstein analyst Douglas Harned. \"Not only are they oversold, but they can’t make what they have already sold.\" Expectations of a 777X deal first surfaced ahead of the show and Bloomberg reported a major order was in the works on Sunday. Turkish Airlines (THY) (THYAO.IS)New Tab burst onto the show's agenda on Saturday with word from state-run Anadolu news agency that it was in talks to buy up to 355 Airbus jets. That triggered preparations for a high-profile announcement at the air show on Monday, and then Tuesday, as a Mideast source predicted a \"bold move\" in the backyard of Gulf rivals. In an unusual holding statement, Airbus said it had reached agreement \"in principle\" on a significant THY order. But it added the deal needed to be ratified in the coming days, in what sources saw as a sign it may no longer be announced at the show. Other significant orders appeared to be in the works without being played out in public in Dubai. Saudi Arabia's newest airline Riyadh Air said it is still in talks with planemakers to place an order for narrow-body jets. Saudia Airlines Group is planning to order about 150 narrow-bodied aircraft for Saudia Airline and low-cost Flyadeal, the group's vice president for fleet management told Asharq TV. Saudi Arabia has established Riyadh Air as part of plans to transform the kingdom into a major aviation hub. With many jets not due to be delivered until 2030 and remain in the skies for two decades, airlines are gambling on long-term demand from future travelers, many of whom have yet to be born. But the show was overshadowed by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza that is pushing up demand for weapons and closing airspace. Ordering six Boeing 787s, Royal Jordanian's chief executive said the airline was seeing a reduction in traffic and having to operate longer routes as a result of the neighbouring war. \"There's enough statistical evidence, at least in the short term, to show that there's been a substantial drop in tickets sales into the region,\" said Daniel Silke, director of Cape Town-based Political Futures Consultancy. Analysts have said the war in Gaza is likely to reinforce demand for weapons on top of a surge in the past 18 months as the United States and its allies rearm Ukraine against Russia. However, few major arms deals were expected at the show where stands of Israeli arms firms Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems remained empty.",

Average compensation for equity and nonequity partners together rose to $1.18 million. Easley's disclosureNew Tab showed $498,750 in salary and bonus at McGuireWoods, where he has worked since 2010. Easley, the son of a former North Carolina governor, became a partner effective January 2020. His clients have included DuPont de Nemours Inc, Smithfield Foods Inc, The Boeing Co, Wells Fargo Bank NA and the Bank of New York Mellon. Last year, profits per equity partner increased at McGuireWoods to $1.6 million, and the firm saw revenue per lawyer tick up to $891,000, according to The American Lawyer.

The work conducted in Tianjin on the jet includes cabin installation, painting, production flight test, and aircraft delivery, Airbus said in a statement. Foreign media were not allowed to attend the delivery event in Tianjin. Airbus has been more aggressive than Boeing in moving parts of its manufacturingprocess to China in the hope of increasing its share of sales in the world's biggest market for new planes. Airbus expects to deliver this year a total of five A350s from Tianjin. In 2008, Tianjin became the company's first final assembly line for the A320 narrowbody jet outside Europe, and in 2017 it became a completion and delivery facility for the A330. Boeing waited until December, 2018 to open its first completion plant in China at Zhoushan for the 737 MAX. But, the model was grounded three months later following a second fatal crash and its return to service has yet to be approvedNew Tab by China's aviation regulator. Airbus has been gaining market share in China as the domestic travel market has rebounded to pre-COVID levels, while Boeing is still grappling with Chinese scrutiny over the 737 MAX and a dearth of orders amid broader U.S.-China tensions. Airbus delivered 99 planes to China last year and 64 more in the first half this year despite the global pandemic, although Chinese airlines have used COVID-related border restrictions as an excuse to defer taking some deliveries from overseas. read more Customers in the Asia-Pacific region have unfilled orders for 123 A350 planes as of end-June, the latest data from the European planemaker showed.",

The preliminary agreement for 20 A320neo and 8 A321neo aircraft was made on the third day of the Dubai Airshow, the largest in-person aerospace industry event since before the pandemic. Jazeera Chief Executive Rohit Ramachandran told reporters the new aircraft, due to be delivered from 2026, would help reduce emissions by replacing older A320 models and also power expansion plans including in Europe and the Middle East. \"We would like to take deliveries sooner. We understand the supply chain constraints with Airbus,\" he said, adding that he was enthusiastic and hopeful jets would arrive sooner. Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said the planemaker would look to identify any opportunities to speed up deliveries if possible. The order was worth $3.4 billion at list prices, Jazeera said later in a stock market filing, though its common for airlines to receive large discounts on orders. The deal includes options to buy a further five jets. Reuters had reported earlier on Tuesday that Jazeera was close to handing Airbus an order for A320neos at the airshow. The order was posted after years of deliberations by the Kuwaiti airline which as recently as Nov. 1 said it was in talks with Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N)New Tab . \"We believe now we are through with what we consider to be the worst of the effects of the pandemic and we need to now be decisive,\" Ramachandran said.",

The flights from its hub in Guangzhou to Zhengzhou and Wuhan, if completed, would be the first 737 MAX passenger flights since the country's aviation regulator grounded the model in March 2019 after fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Chinese airlines had 97 of the planes before the grounding, according to Cirium data in 2019. China Southern did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment on China Southern's plans but said the manufacturer continued to work with regulators and customers to safely return the 737 MAX to service worldwide. On Wednesday, Boeing said it had another 138 planes manufactured for Chinese carriers that were in the United States waiting to be delivered, though it had begun remarketing the jets to other carriers given there were no concrete signs that Chinese airlines would accept the planes in the near term. China is the only major market in the world where airlines have not returned the 737 MAX to passenger flying. \"It is really hard for me to find signals that things are going to change in China and move in our direction,\" Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun told analysts on an earnings call. His comments came despite China Southern flying at least two of its 737 MAX jets on test flights over the past week, according to data from flight tracking website FlightRadar24, in a move that would be expected ahead of a return to commercial service.

            "text": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan. With market visibility extremely low, bouts of optimism about peak interest rates this year are being repeatedly punctured by the related fear of falling demand and the prospect of a looming profits recession. And deep in the weeds of the fourth-quarter corporate earnings season, Microsoft's (MSFT.O)New Tab overnight rollercoaster probably defines the uncertainty. Microsoft stock surged almost 5% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after its bottom line beat the Street consensus. But the gains were quickly wiped out after a gloomier outlook for its cloud business Azure dampened the mood, before Wednesday's outage of its Teams and Outlook services added another glitch to leave the stock down 1% ahead of Wednesday's open. The mixed earnings picture dampened early week enthusiasm surrounding tech stocks and chipmakers. Even forecast sales growth of 25% in 2023 wasn't enough to stop shares in Dutch chip equipment giant ASML (ASML.AS)New Tab giving back some of its 20%-plus gains for the year so far and they dropped 2% on Wednesday. Antitrust worries also rattled Big Tech. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O)New Tab lost 2% on Tuesday after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Google for abusing its dominance of the digital advertising business. Up next on the corporate roundup on Wednesday are Tesla, IBM, Boeing, AT&T and NextEra Energy. After a spluttering close on Tuesday, Wall St stock futures were down almost 1% before the open today. The bigger macro picture was no less equivocal than the earnings drumbeat. While the first U.S. business surveys of the year showed some of last year's pessimism lifting, and above forecast, they also showed the 7th straight month of contracting activity in January. The Richmond Federal Reserve's manufacturing index plunged back to its lowest since June, the low for the current cycle. U.S. Treasury yields slipped back, with 10-year yields falling to 3.43% as eyes drift to next week's Fed policy meeting and the assumption the central bank will downsize its latest rate rise to 25 basis points. With the debt ceiling impasse also in the background, the U.S. yield curve between 3-months and 10-years inverted to another 40-year low of minus 130bp. Traders will watch the Bank of Canada policy decision later on Wednesday for confirmation that interest rate rises are slowing down at least. The BoC is expected to raise rates by another 25bp to 4.5% this week, but then hit the pause button on what has been an aggressive tightening campaign. The global inflation picture also gives mixed signals. While annual British input and factory gate price inflation fell back far more than forecast last month, Australian consumer price inflation data shocked markets as it shot to a 33-year high in the December quarter. The chance it may force the Reserve Bank of Australia to lift interest rates again boosted the Aussie dollar. There was more evidence of the new year euro zone business rejuvenation as Germany firms' optimism improved amid easing energy costs and a warm winter. In deals news, Rupert Murdoch withdrew a proposal to reunite News Corp (NWSA.O)New Tab and Fox - with the company exploring a sale of Move Inc, which operates the Realtor.com website, to CoStar Group for about $3 billion. Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday: * Bank of Canada policy decision. * U.S. Treasury Secretary visits South Africa * U.S. Treasury auctions 5-year note, 2-year floating rate note * U.S. corp earnings: Tesla, Ameriprise, Nasdaq, U.S. Bancorp, Abbott, NextEra, AT&T, IBM, Boeing, CSX, Seagate Technology, Crown Castle, Lam Research, Freeport-McMoRan, Hess, Las Vegas Sands, ADP, ServiceNow, Teradyne, United Rentals, Kimberly-Clark, Norfolk Southern, Marketaxess, Amphenol, Textron etc",

Macron and Modi agreed to expand bilateral ties in defence production, nuclear energy, space research and the use of artificial intelligence for public services like climate change, health and agriculture, the statement said. It did not specify the value of any deals. After Russia, France is the largest arms supplier to India, which has relied on its fighter jets for four decades. The leaders welcomed the setting up of maintenance, repair and overhaul services by France's Safran (SAF.PA)New Tab for leading-edge aviation propulsion (LEAP) engines in India and adding such services for Rafale engines, and a helicopter partnership. The bilateral summit during Macron's 40-hour visit, was the fifth Macron-Modi meeting since May. India's Tata Group and France's Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab have signed an agreement to manufacture civilian helicopters together, Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said. French jet engine maker CFM International also announced an agreement with India’s Akasa Air to buy more than 300 of its LEAP-1B engines to power 150 Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 737 MAX aircraft. Akasa Air previously ordered 76 aircraft powered by the engine, of which 22 are in use. India and France agreed to intensify cooperation in the southwest Indian Ocean, building on joint surveillance missions carried out from the French island territory of La Reunion in 2020 and 2022, the government statement said.

            "text": "Tuesday's runway collision in Japan marks the first time a modern lightweight airliner has burnt down and is being seen as a test case for how well a new generation of carbon-composite airplanes copes with a catastrophic fire. The Japan Airlines (JAL) Airbus A350 crashed into a De Havilland Dash-8 coast guard turboprop plane shortly after landing at Haneda airport in Tokyo, bursting in to flames. All 379 people aboard the A350 were evacuated from the burning aircraft, but five of the six coast guard crew were killed. Photographs of the wreckage showed the A350 fuselage in cinders. While investigators seek the cause of the collision, the aviation industry is keen to confirm the survivability of high-tech composite airliners which have transformed the economics of long-haul flight and airlines in the past decade. The crash \"is really the first case study that we have, not only from a fire perspective, but also just from a crash survivability perspective,\" said Anthony Brickhouse, an air safety expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Both Boeing (BA.N)New Tab , with the 787 Dreamliner, and Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab , with the A350, made big bets in the early 2000s that lightweight carbon composites would produce major fuel savings and be less susceptible to fatigue, reducing maintenance. Shortly after being put into service, the Dreamliner contended with battery problems that led to fires, resulting in its brief grounding in early 2013. A later fire on an Ethiopian Airlines 787 in July 2013 was caused by a short circuit in the jet's emergency locator transmitter and led to fuselage repairs. None of these incidents resulted in hull losses, however. The A350 contains 53% composite materials by weight, with composites making up most of its external structure, including its fuselage, major portions of its tail and wings, and part of the nose section. Experts said the fact that all passengers and crew evacuated safely while the structure was intact will renew confidence in the materials which were certified with special conditions. But they cautioned it is too early to draw full conclusions about how the A350's composite hull held up against fire or what technological lessons may be learned. Comparing the A350 crash to a 2013 crash involving a Boeing 777 operated by Asiana Airlines - which caught fire after it struck a sea wall, killing three passengers - could provide engineers with valuable insights into the differences between composite and aluminum planes during a fire, Brickhouse said. The JAL (9201.T)New Tab A350 is the first commercial airliner built mainly of composites to be destroyed by fire but not the first transport aircraft, though it is unclear what lessons about composite fires will be available to Japanese investigators. In 2015, an Airbus A400M military airlifter - which also relies heavily on composites - plowed into a field outside Seville, Spain, after wrongly installed software jammed its engines. But an investigation into the crash by Spanish military investigators was kept confidential. The accident, which resulted in a high-speed impact and fire, killed all four flight test crew and left hardly any visible trace of the plane in the blackened earth. Composite airframes have several advantages over aluminum planes, said Bjorn Fehrm, a composites expert at trade publication Leeham News. While aluminum has a melting point of about 600 degrees Celsius (1,100 degrees Fahrenheit) and conducts heat, carbon fiber can withstand temperatures about six times that, with the structure smoldering and burning away instead of melting, he said. Airbus, in a 2019 guide for firefighters, said the A350 demonstrated \"an equivalent level of safety\" compared to traditional aluminum planes, with tests showing an \"increased resistance\" to fire penetration. But when exposed to intense heat for long periods of time, Airbus noted that composite airframes can lose their structural integrity even if the composite skin appears to be intact. In particular, the resin will burn off first and flames will propagate more slowly while the fire is ongoing, according to a United States Federal Aviation Administration document. The JAL A350 burned for more than six hours before firefighters were able to completely extinguish the flames, broadcaster TBS reported, citing the fire department. That raises a question about whether firefighters need additional training for handling fires involving composite jets. Photos of the accident showed firefighters wearing surgical masks and helmets but no other protective clothing. \"The fire brigades of the airports actually have to look at why couldn't they stop the fire,\" Fehrm said. Airbus noted earlier tests have shown composites offer similar fire-resistance to aluminum, with a spokesperson adding that it had carried out a full evacuation test of the an Airbus A350-1000 in 2018 with authorities present. Various factors can impact how flammable composites are, including the structure, fiber materials and layers of fire-blockers used, said Nabil Al Kabir, a sales manager at German fire safety solutions firm svt Products GmbH. \"One point can be taken for sure, if the heat generated from burning kerosene is that intense, aluminum would also fail.\"",

            "text": "A door panel that flew off a Boeing 737 MAX 9 jet mid-flight on Jan. 5 appeared to be missing four key bolts, according to a preliminary report from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board released on Tuesday. Here are five key takeaways from the report. The 19-page NTSB report said four important bolts that played a role in holding the door plug in place appear to be missing and have not been recovered. Damage patterns and the lack of damage around holes associated with the missing bolts \"indicate that the four bolts that prevent upward movement of the MED (door) plug were missing\" before the door plug moved upward and blew out of the plane. The report noted five damaged rivets next to the site of the door plug. The bolts in the door plug would have needed to be removed to repair the rivets. In a photo supplied by Boeing (BA.N)New Tab in the report, one can see the door plug after the rivets were repaired and just before interior material like insulation was restored. In three locations visible in the photo the key bolts were missing. \"The investigation continues to determine what manufacturing documents were used to authorize the opening and closing of the plug during the rivet rework,\" the report said. The door plug was manufactured by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N)New Tab in Malaysia in March 2023 and then sent to its facility in Wichita, Kansas, in May where it was installed on the fuselage before being delivered to Boeing. During the building process it was noted that the door seal was off very slightly. But no action was required because Spirit determined that situation \"was structurally and functionally acceptable.\" Inside the airplane investigators found damage in seat rows 25 ABC and 26 ABC, but otherwise no signs of any other failures or malfunction in the plane or any of its systems. The report said Boeing and Spirit Aerosystems staff still need to be interviewed and that investigators will be looking at safety management systems as the investigation continues.",

            "text": "Recusal motions are always a risky bet. No judges, no matter how fair-minded and thick-skinned, welcome the suggestion that they cannot decide a case fairly or that their impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Plaintiffs lawyer Patrick Jones of Chicago's PMJ law firm took that bet twice in one case – and lost both times. Jones represents a prospective class of international pilots who claim that The Boeing Co is responsible for the money they spent on training to fly 737 MAX jets and for the wages they lost when the jets were grounded after two fatal crashes. He brought two different motions calling on U.S. District Judge Steven Seeger of Chicago to step aside. The first oneNew Tab , filed in 2020, was premised on Seeger’s former partnership at Kirkland & Ellis, which is defending Boeing in the pilots’ case. The second motionNew Tab , filed last month, was based on Seeger’s tenure at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which began investigating Boeing shortly before Seeger left for the bench. The judge denied both bids, with some sharp words for Jones and his co-counsel. “The two motions pull in opposite directions,” Seeger wrote in an orderNew Tab on Monday. “Is this court biased in favor of Boeing, because it used to work at defense counsel's firm? Or is this court biased against Boeing, because it used to work for an agency that investigated and charged Boeing? This court can't help but think that plaintiffs are playing a game of heads−I−win, tails−you−lose.\" Recusal, Seeger said, \"is not a game, and this court will not play along.” You might think a lawyer would be chastened by that kind of admonishment. Not Jones. In a phone interview on Tuesday, he told me he has no regrets. “We had to rattle [Seeger’s] cage,” he said. Jones said that before this litigation, he had never filed a single recusal motion, let alone two in one case. But he maintains that the pilots’ two motions were both warranted. And the second bid, he said, served an important strategic purpose. In fact, you could make a decent argument that the second motion advanced Jones’ case, despite Seeger’s harsh words about gamesmanship. Seeger did not respond to a detailed phone message I left with a clerk. Boeing counsel Michael Slade of Kirkland also did not respond to my query. Boeing has said it is engaged in an effort \"to responsibly resolve outstanding legal matters related to the 737 MAX accidents,” but has insisted that the pilots' case is meritless. The company argues that the international pilots suffered no direct injury from 737 MAX jets and, as employees of Boeing customers they are too far removed from any relationship with the company to hold Boeing liable. Seeger joined the Chicago federal bench in 2019, after his aforementioned jobs at Kirkland and the SEC. The pilots’ case was one of the first to be transferred to his docket. Jones told me he quickly sensed that Seeger was skeptical about the pilots’ claims. At the first status conferenceNew Tab he oversaw, for instance, Seeger questioned whether the pilots had standing to sue in federal court based on a complaint that emphasized their fear of flying unsafe jets. (Jones called the comments “very snarky and unprofessional.”) Jones said he filed the first recusal motion after he realized that Boeing’s lead lawyer had been a partner when Seeger was an associate at Kirkland. “There was no way he would trust our arguments more than Mike Slade’s arguments,” Jones said. Kirkland arguedNew Tab that the timing of the motion, which followed Seeger’s ruling that the pilots could not proceed anonymously, was suspicious. The firm also said that a search of its old records turned up no evidence that Seeger ever billed Boeing before departing the firm in 2010. No “reasonable and informed person,” Kirkland argued, could question Seeger’s fairness based on that record. Seeger denied the motionNew Tab from the bench in March 2020, highlighting the pledge he took when he was named a judge. “I take that oath incredibly seriously, more seriously than you can probably know,” he said. “If you want me to rule in your favor, here's all you've got to do: Make a better argument than the other side, convince me that the law is on your side, the facts are on your side, and I'm going to rule in your favor. I really will.” That hearing took place several days after Boeing filed its motion to dismissNew Tab the pilots’ case on March 6,2020. Briefing on that motion concluded in July 2020. For the next two years, nothing substantive happened in the case, according to the docket. Jones said he and his clients were convinced Seeger would grant Boeing’s dismissal motion, since the judge had already signaled doubts about the pilots’ theory. He told me he was sure that he would eventually have to take the pilots’ case to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But he and his clients, Jones said, were frustrated by the two-year wait for a ruling. “We had to at least push him to rule so we could appeal,” Jones told me. That was at least part of the motivation, he said, for the pilots’ second recusal motion, which Jones filed on Oct. 19, about a month after the SEC announced a $200 million settlement with Boeing. “It is now clear that the court is inextricably intertwined with all sides of this dispute,” the motion said. “Beyond the obvious appearance of impropriety created by Judge Seeger’s prior experience at the law firm now representing the defendant, Judge Seeger [has] failed to acknowledge that his experience at the SEC immediately before becoming a judge further [warrants] his recusal.” If the point of the second recusal motion was to prod Seeger to rule on the Boeing dismissal motion, Jones got what he wanted. On Monday – less than two weeks after Jones filed the motion – Seeger finally ruled on Boeing’s dismissal motion. As Jones expected, he tossed the pilots’ caseNew Tab , holding that Boeing was too far removed from any injury the pilots experienced. Jones said he will appeal. When you’ve got almost nothing to lose, as Jones believed he did in the Boeing case, even a bad bet isn’t much of risk.

            "text": "Boeing shares (BA.N)New Tab fell 4% in early trading on Thursday after the U.S. planemaker warned of delays in near-term deliveries of 737 MAX jets due to a fresh quality issue involving its biggest supplier Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N)New Tab . This could put pressure on the top end of Boeing's annual 737 delivery target of 450 planes, some Wall Street analysts warned even as the planemaker said it was evaluating that goal. It is for the second year that Boeing's delivery targets are under review, after supply-chain issues forced it to temper its goal last year. The latest quality issue is due to improperly shaped holes in the aft pressure bulkhead of some planes. The bulkhead is a structure that seals off the rear of the pressurized cabin. The parts in question were made by Spirit, whose shares hit an over two-and-a-half year low of $20.09. But not all 737 fuselages will be impacted as Spirit usesNew Tab multiple suppliers for the aft pressure bulkhead. Boeing believes the defect is limited to a portion of its bestselling MAX 8 model, but was evaluating if older-model 737 Next Generation jets have also been impacted. \"It is early days on both the near and long-term financial impacts of the issue, but it appears the fix is likely to take several weeks for completed aircraft,\" Citi analyst Jason Gursky said in a note. The planemaker's ratio of enterprise value to sales for the next 12 months is 2, compared to 1.3 for rival Airbus, as per Refinitiv data. A low ratio implies a more attractive investment opportunity. The defect also adds more pressure on Spirit after it took a financial hit from a another quality issue and reported bleak results due to a worker strike earlier this year. Boeing's shares were trading at $219.50 compared with Wall Street's median price target of $254.70. It was $238.50 three months ago.",

Delta, which made the announcement at the Farnborough Airshow, said it would start taking MAX 10 deliveries in 2025. Delta previously was the only major U.S. airline without a MAX in its fleet or on order. The MAX was grounded for 20 months after two fatal crashes killed 346 people. The grounding was lifted in November 2020 after software and training updates. \"This is a huge testament to the value of the MAX,\" said Boeing senior vice president of commercial sales and marketing Ihssane Mounir at a signing event. \"What an endorsement from a world-class airline.\" Boeing has had \"strong demand\" for the MAX since the ungrounding, with over 1,000 gross orders and 1.7 million flight hours, Boeing's Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal said.

Reuters separately reported a top-up order from Delta for around a dozen Airbus A220s is set to be signed as soon as Tuesday at the air show. Boeing faces a December deadline to win approval for the 737 MAX 10 - the largest member of its best-selling single-aisle airplane family. Otherwise, it must meet new cockpit alerting requirements under a 2020 law, unless Congress waives it. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told Aviation Week in an interview published this month that the planemaker could be forced to cancel the 737 MAX 10 over potential regulatory issues. On Sunday, Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal said that canceling the MAX 10 was \"not a high probability path.\" Delta said in the event of a delay in certification \"the agreement has adequate protection in place, including allowing Delta to shift to another model of the MAX family if necessary.\" Delta had extensive discussions with Boeing before it agreed to the deal. \"It took us a long time getting here,\" Delta senior vice president Mahendra Nair said, saying it had options if the MAX 10 does not move forward. \"This is really the airplane that we would want and we would hope that Boeing can get the extension that they need for the certification.\" The MAX 10 aircraft will be 20%-30% more fuel efficient than the retiring Delta planes it will replace.",

            "text": "Planemakers are betting on steady demand for business jets as the world's largest corporate aircraft show kicks off on Tuesday, but analysts are turning cautious about the appetite for private flying due to growing macroeconomic risks and a fading pandemic-induced boom. The National Business Aviation Association's (NBAA) annual corporate aircraft show kicks off in Las Vegas against a backdrop of persistent supply-chain snags, high interest rates, an uncertain economic picture and escalating geopolitical tensions amid the military conflict in the Middle East. Private aviation witnessed a surge during the pandemic, both in users and buyers, as the wealthy took control of their travel due to public health concerns. Although those concerns have faded and commercial air service on key routes has resumed, industry executives have said they don't see demand slowing. But Wall Street is turning cautious. \"If the Israel-Hamas situation worsens, oil prices spike up and the economy slows down. That could be a factor affecting demand,\" TD Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr said. \"It is a cyclical business after all.\" Marquee names such as Bombardier (BBDb.TO)New Tab , Textron (TXT.N)New Tab , Embraer (EMBR3.SA)New Tab and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab are expected to showcase their latest models at the show, according to the NBAA. Textron (TXT.N)New Tab took the wraps off its newest Cessna Citation CJ3 Gen2 business jet on Monday, while Embraer unveiled its Phenom 100EX business jet, its latest aircraft in the Phenom 100 series, last week. \"We're happy with the conversations we're having with our customers and are looking forward to a great show,\" a Textron Aviation spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Bombardier (BBDb.TO)New Tab also said on Monday it will detail flight testing progress for its Global 8000 aircraft, which it says will be the world's fastest business jet. \"We continue to see growing demand globally for our BBJ (Boeing Business Jets) family of airplanes,\" Boeing said. On Sunday, engine maker Honeywell estimated a 10% growth in new business jet deliveries in 2024 and joined several planemakers in emphasizing the strength of global demand for new business jets. As a pure-play business jet provider with financial leverage, Bombardier is most exposed to any weakness in demand, followed by Textron, J.P.Morgan analyst Seth Seifman said in a note. Manufacturers are expected to continue reporting robust backlogs and book-to-bill ratios above 1.00, though likely not as strong as those seen 12 to 18 months ago, said Adam Cowburn, managing director at Alton Aviation Consultancy. The book-to-bill ratio is an indication of future demand and a ratio of over 1 is considered healthy. Cowburn said he expects the market will eventually settle at levels that are structurally around 15% higher than pre-COVID levels. Meanwhile, industry watchers expect new jet orders to be announced at the NBAA event. Private jet company Flexjet is expected to place a large order and analysts expect Bombardier will be the likely winner. \"Textron, Dassault Falcon and Bombardier are most likely to announce fleet orders given their relatively strong positions with fractional program customers,\" said Rolland Vincent, a consultant and founder of business aviation forecasting service JetNet. Fractional ownership is an arrangement in which multiple owners share the use and costs of purchasing and operating a private aircraft. However, General Dynamics' (GD.N)New Tab Gulfstream Aerospace, a major business jet manufacturer, said on Monday that it is not participating in the event.",

Although the planes are insured, the unprecedented nature and scale of the potential losses will likely mean years of litigation between lessors and insurers before any decisions on payouts are taken, analysts say. read more And even if the planes are repossessed, the recoverable value would be in question because the aircraft must have accurate maintenance records to ensure they have been fitted with genuine, traceable components - another area targeted by Western sanctions on Russia. read more Although the total value of the planes is huge, the impact on individual leasing firms may still be manageable even if writedowns are required as aircraft leased to Russian airlines account for less than 10% of most leasing firm portfolios. \"It's not going to cripple these businesses,\" said Brad Dailey, a director at Alton Aviation Consultancy who previously worked at Ireland-based leasing giant AerCap Holdings (AER.N)New Tab . \"What it does do in my view is it changes the future market potential of Russia,\" he said. Some private airlines have indicated their willingness to hand back planes to the lessors, although it is unclear whether the Russian government will approve the transactions. Russia's UTair Airlines (UTAR.MM)New Tab said on March 14 it would withdraw from service all nine of its leased Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 737 NGs, citing owner requirements, a move that could preserve longer-term relations after sanctions end. Those planes have not flown since that announcement but remain in Russia, data from flight tracking website FlightRadar24 show. In some cases, lessors have security deposits that could be forfeit and could help cover a portion of any losses - but still only a fraction of a plane's value. For example, a security deposit on narrowbody plane worth $20 million could be about $450,000, the equivalent of three months rent, Alton's Dailey said. Ratings agency KBRA said security deposits generally range from one to four months of rent, depending on the credit assessment of the airline leasing the plane. Russian national carrier Aeroflot (AFLT.MM)New Tab had been viewed as the best credit risk before the invasion, industry sources said, although that assessment no longer applies after Moscow's move to register its planes in Russia. A person at a Chinese lessor with exposure to Aeroflot said no security deposits had been taken from the airline and said insurance payouts appeared to be the only route to cover losses. The lessor plans to begin insurance claims after the March 28 deadline has passed, said the person, who was not authorised to speak publicly about the matter. A source at another Chinese lessor with exposure to Aeroflot said that, instead of taking a security deposit, it held U.S. dollar letters of credit from Russian banks - but the source said they had no effective value now because of Russian currency controls imposed in response to financial sanctions. At lower-tier airlines, lessors are more likely to have stronger security deposits in place, Dailey said.",

            "text": "Ryanair (RYA.I)New Tab expects to be five to ten aircraft short for its peak 2024 summer season due to Boeing (BA.N)New Tab delivery delays, likely forcing it to revise down its traffic growth, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told the Financial Times on Tuesday. Ryanair was due to have 57 Boeing MAX 8200 planes delivered by the end of April, and O'Leary said the delays mean it will likely carry 200 million passengers for the financial year beginning in April versus the 205 million previously forecast. The low cost carrier made cuts to its winter schedule due to the ongoing delays that forced it to lower its traffic forecast for the year to March 2024 to 183.5 million passengers from 185 million, representing year-on-year growth of 9%. \"We were supposed to have 27 aircraft delivered prior to Christmas, we finished up getting 11. We're supposed to have 57 aircraft delivered to us by the end of April, and we think we'd be lucky to get 50 by the end of June,\" O'Leary said in an interview with the Financial Times. \"So we're going to be left five, seven, maybe 10 aircraft short for the peak summer season this year.\" \"It costs us, if you're talking being down 5 million on 205 million passengers . . . probably two, two and a half per cent of profits,\" he added. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded 171 MAX 9 planes on Saturday after a panel called a door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines flight not long after taking off from a Portland, Oregon, airport on Friday. While Ryanair operates and orders different variants of the 737 MAX from the type grounded, O'Leary said Boeing and rival planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab \"need to significantly improve quality control\" as they seek to catch up on production delays. The Irish airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, exclusively uses Boeing 737s for its mainline fleet and is one of Boeing's largest customers. \"The 737 is fine. But it doesn't need these kind of short-term reputational issues,\" O'Leary said in the interview.",

            "text": "General Electric Co (GE.N)New Tab will split into three public companies as the storied U.S. industrial conglomerate seeks to simplify its business, pare down debt and breathe life into a battered share price, the company said on Tuesday. The split marks the endNew Tab of the 129-year-old conglomerate that was once the most valuable U.S. corporation and a global symbol of American business power. GE shares closed 2.6% higher at $111.29 on Tuesday, after reaching a nearly 3-1/2 year high, compared with a 0.35% drop in the broader S&P 500 (.SPX)New Tab index. The industrial conglomerate's shares have gained about 9% since July 30 when the company reduced the number of its traded shares. In the past three years, GE Chief Executive Larry Culp has focused on reducing debt by selling assets, and improving cash flows by streamlining operations and cutting overhead costs. \"With the progress on the deleveraging, the progress with our operational transformationNew Tab , the pandemic lifting ... there's no reason to wait a day (for the split),\" Culp told Reuters in an interview. \"It's the right thing to do.\" [nL4N2S04PI] The Boston-based company said the three businesses would focus on energy, healthcare and aviation. GE will separate the healthcare company, in which it expects to retain a stake of 19.9%, in early 2023. It will combine GE Renewable EnergyNew Tab , GE Power and GE Digital and spin off the business in early 2024. read more Following the split, it will become an aviation company, helmed by Culp. The aviation company will inherit GE's other assets and liabilities, including its runoff insurance business. A company spokesperson said brands and names of the spun-off units will be decided later. It is the boldest attemptNew Tab under Culp, who took GE's reins in 2018, to simplify the company's business. Measures taken so far have led to an improvement in GE's balance sheet, putting it on track to reduce debt by more than $75 billion by the end of 2021. The company now expects to generate more than $7 billion in free cash flow in 2023 and is planning to monetize its stakes in Baker Hughes, AerCap and the healthcare unit to cut its net debt to less than $35 billion by then. Culp told Reuters the decision to split the company was paved by GE's progress in terms of repairing its balance sheet and operational performance. He did not expect the spinoff to face any regulatory or labor issues and said there was no investor pressure behind the decision. \"Spins create a lot of value,\" he said in the interview. \"These are moves geared toward making GE stronger, helping our businesses and the teams perform better.\" INDUSTRIAL POWERHOUSE Culp's strategy is in stark contrast to the path GE pursued in the 1980s and 1990s under Jack Welch, who expanded the company into an industrial behemoth. A founding member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI)New Tab in 1896, GE spent more than a century in that storied stock index before getting the boot in 2018 following years of sliding valuation. It created the first electric cooking range and clothes washer, the first nuclear power plant, and supplied the U.S. space program. Its interests have spanned television, movies and insurance to lightbulbs and locomotives. However, it has been facing investor skepticism about its ability to turn a corner since the 2008 financial crisis, while struggling with debt. The sagging fortunes prompted the company to fire Chief Executive John Flannery and hand over the reins to Culp. For a graphic, see https://tmsnrt.rs/30eqk2rNew Tab . The company's revenue for 2020 was $79.62 billion, a far cry from the $180 billion-plus in revenue it booked in 2008. In 2015, activist investor Nelson Peltz took a stake in GE and demanded changes at the company, including moving away from finance operations and toward its industrial roots. On Tuesday, Peltz's company, Trian, said it \"enthusiastically supports this important step in the transformation of GE.\" GE's aviation business, usually its cash cow, makes jet engines for Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab and Airbus SE (AIR.PA)New Tab . Questions remain over how the company will fund the unit's operations, which tend to be very capital-intensive. The company reckons the aviation unit's low-cost structure, strong order book and investment-grade balance sheet would let it tap capital markets. But some analysts say the unit's valuation could suffer as it will also take over GE's financial liabilities after the split. \"There is clearly a debate among investors as to how much the aviation valuation should be penalized vs peers because of the financial liabilities,\" analysts at Barclays wrote in a note. An industry source, however, said the aviation business has been distracted until now by propping up rest of the company, which took a lot of the unit's bandwidth. The unit is expected to be valued at more than $100 billion after the spinoff, the source added. Culp also said the split would make different units \"more focused\" and result in \"greater accountability.\" read more The company expects to take a one-time charge of $2 billion related to separation and operational costs and tax costs of less than $500 million.",

            "title": "North American aviation companies get labor relief from foreign workers, at a cost",
            "text": "Aerospace supplier CEO Hugue Meloche spends more than C$10,000 for each skilled foreign worker he brings to his company's Montreal-area factories, but paying those costs is preferable to leaving key positions unfilled while orders boom. As clients like engine maker General Electric (GE.N)New Tab boosted production in 2022, the head of Meloche Group hired 20% of its workforce of 500 from countries like Mexico, Tunisia and Brazil to make up for staffing shortfalls. This added at least C$1 million ($736,377.03) in costs at a company generating around C$100 million in annual revenue. Added costs like those are especially hitting smaller suppliers with limited resources, industry officials said. The suppliers must then cut costs elsewhere or pass on those extra charges to their customers while struggling to meet demands for competitive pricing and higher production from planemakers Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab . The tight manufacturing labor market, following a wave of retirements during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, has led North American aircraft repair shops and suppliers, especially in Canada, to recruit a small but growing number of workers from abroad. This fills critical positions but puts a fresh burden on small suppliers whose human resources staff normally do not help new arrivals find homes and cars. These challenges are not going away as airline and aerospace executives remain cautious on supply chains and see problems persisting until 2025. Meloche's company in the Canadian province of Quebec offers loans to recruits, as well as short-term housing. It has four employees dedicated to helping newcomers with everything from finding a new home to buying a car. \"We are the help desk,\" Meloche said in an interview. \"We have huge needs. For us, immigration is not a choice.\" Plane and engine makers rely less on foreign labor since they have the heft to lure domestic talent with better incentives, recruiters say. But they are not immune. Business jet maker Bombardier (BBDb.TO)New Tab , which has 17,000 workers globally and generated $6.9 billion in 2022 revenue, told Reuters it expects international recruitment will represent 10% to 15% of its Quebec production workforce hired in the next few years, an estimate that was not previously reported. It currently employs about 9,400 in Quebec. Airbus' Canadian division said some of its recruitment needs must be met via immigration, while Boeing said the use of U.S. visas to bring in foreign workers \"is very limited.\" Montreal-based Bombardier is taking on 40 new Moroccan workers with 40 more set to join, following its first international recruitment mission for trade laborers this year. The company provides housing, paid flights and other perks. Offering that kind of help is harder for smaller suppliers, which make up most of the 17 aerospace companies in Quebec that hunted for workers abroad in 2022, according to data from Canadian recruitment specialist AURAY Sourcing International. \"We're asking (human resource departments) to ... have other tasks they've never had, such as looking for apartments,\" AURAY client services manager Emilie Sauvé said. For companies like Meloche that have had employees poached, or leave for jobs at planemakers, one benefit in hiring foreign workers under immigration rules is that \"they have to be loyal to the company they're hired for,\" Sauvé said. \"The small suppliers are drowning.\" Hugue Meloche, who expects his business to generate C$135 million in 2023 revenue, sees recent economic headwinds easing the labor shortage, but recruitment of foreign workers will persist in Canada's aerospace hub. Indeed, recruiters say Canadian aerospace companies use foreign workers more than their U.S. counterparts due to the availability of immigration programs that allow such hiring more easily north of the border. But U.S. aircraft repair companies also consider foreign workers as an option, with a North American shortfall of aviation maintenance workers likely to hit 43,000 by 2027, according to consultant Oliver Wyman. One U.S. trade association representing aircraft repair shops is weighing whether in-demand jobs like aircraft mechanics could be eligible for special visas. AAR Corp (AIR.N)New Tab , a Chicago-based network of aircraft maintenance shops, has recruited some technicians from Mexico in recent years under an existing visa due to growing shortages at home, said Ryan Goertzen, a company vice president. Figures for foreign aerospace workers in the U.S. were not available from three government departments approached by Reuters. According to Canadian government data for one nonimmigrant admission program, there were 125 temporary foreign worker positions for aircraft mechanics last year, compared with seven a year earlier and 66 in 2019. There are a handful of programs in Canada used to recruit foreign workers, said Sauvé, adding she expects to see higher numbers this year and next as demand grows at her own firm. The number of aerospace positions targeting international candidates grew 136% at Sauvé's firm this year compared with 2022. \"We had it last year, but this year it's exploded,\" she said. At aircraft repair shop KF Aerospace in British Columbia, workers from countries like South Africa and the Philippines account for about 7% of the workforce. The company has 22 apartments for short-term staff housing. KF hired 40 skilled foreign workers alone this year, compared with roughly 35 over 2018 and 2019 combined. Each skilled foreign worker requires an investment of more than C$11,000 in relocation and immigration costs. But the cost is worth it since KF Aerospace needs skilled workers in order to be able to hire local apprentices, who require mentoring. \"Once we hire them, we want to hang on to them as long as we can,\" KF's chief corporate services officer, Grant Stevens, said, referring to the skilled foreign workers. \"Long gone are the days of, 'just put an ad.'\" ($1 = 1.3580 Canadian dollars)",

            "text": "Boeing (BA.N)New Tab revised up long-term demand forecasts on Tuesday, as a snapback in commercial air travel in domestic markets like the United States tempers the more gloomy industry predictions seen at the height of coronavirus lockdowns last year. The rosier view underpins moves by the aerospace giant to prepare for growth in travel demand and military services, even as its own ability to respond to the brighter outlook remains hampered by industrial delays and the lingering 737 MAX crisis. The U.S. planemaker, which dominates jet sales together with Europe's Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab , forecast 43,610 commercial jet deliveries over the next 20 years worth $7.2 trillion, an increase of 500 units from the 43,110 projected a year ago. On a shorter 10-year view, which is more sensitive to the severe fallout on airlines from the COVID-19 pandemic, Boeing sees 19,330 deliveries, up from last year's forecast of 18,350. The 10-year projection is 6% shy of the forecast it published in 2019, but the drop from pre-crisis levels has narrowed from 11% a year ago. \"One of the strongest reasons for confidence is how quickly we have seen a bounce-back in domestic travel in the last 12 months,\" Boeing Chief Strategy Officer Marc Allen told reporters. Boeing sees domestic flying at pre-crisis levels in 2022 followed by regional traffic in 2023 and international in 2024. Demand for airliners is seen as a bellwether for the wider economy. Boeing raised its assumption for average annual global economic growth to 2.7% from 2.5% from last year's forecast. Boeing and other planemakers are predicting that environmental pressure and COVID-19 will accelerate the retirement of jets, leaving room for new planes in the market. But several analysts have raised concerns about the unpredictable spread of coronavirus variants and ongoing travel restrictions, even as vaccination rates steadily increase. Boeing's forecast for annual passenger traffic growth was unchanged at 4%, although the growth rate has edged lower since 2015 from the once-reliable 5% as a record aviation boom peaked. Over the next decade, Boeing sees demand for $9 trillion of goods and services in the full array of markets it operates in, from freighters to fighters, up from $8.7 trillion a year ago. Its defense and space forecast is flat at $2.6 trillion. The shift of emphasis toward services comes as mounting budget pressures are expected to limit arms spending and further prolong the use of systems already in the U.S. arsenal. Boeing last year began delivering refurbished and modified F/A-18 jets. Boeing slightly increased its 20-year forecast for deliveries of twin-aisle models like its 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 to 7,670 jets, up from 7,480 previously. The segment remains the hardest hit by the crisis as widespread border restrictions choke international air travel. Boeing is currently grappling with a halt in 787 deliveries due to production problems, cutting off a key source of cash. For medium-haul single-aisle jets like its 737 MAX - the industry's No. 1 cash cow - Boeing sees 32,660 deliveries over the next 20 years, up from the previous 32,270. Boeing's 737 MAX returned to service late last year after a nearly two-year safety ban. It recently won approval in India, although a lingering ban in China raises uncertainty. Boeing also cut its 20-year forecast for freighter demand to 890 jets from the 930 it projected a year ago. Demand for freighters has soared during the pandemic as shippers sought alternatives to the belly space of passenger jets, left on the ground due to weak travel demand. Both Boeing and Airbus are proposing to develop new all-cargo planes.",

Shares in the low-cost pioneer, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, were up 6% at 0850 GMT. Ryanair forecast after-tax profit for the year to end March of between 1.85 billion and 2.05 billion euros, easily beating its previous record of 1.45 billion euros in 2018. \"We think we are set for strong growth next year, both in terms of headline traffic numbers ... and underlying air fares during the peak period,\" Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a video presentation. Ryanair has been increasing capacity far faster than most rivals to take advantage of the travel boom that followed COVID-era lockdowns, flying 25% more passengers between July and September this year than in 2019. European capacity overall was down 7% over the same period from 2019 levels, according to Eurocontrol, which manages European airspace. O'Leary said problems with Pratt & Whitney engines would likely constrain capacity deployed by rivals which fly Airbus jets next summer, while low output by airplane manufacturers would limit capacity until 2030. Ryanair said it would pay a maiden regular dividend of 400 million euros next year and in subsequent years will return approximately 25% of the after-tax profit via an ordinary dividend. The dividend policy is a \"strong vote of confidence in the company\", Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan said in an interview. Ryanair earned 2.18 billion euros in the six months to the end of September, the first half of its financial year, 59% ahead of its previous record for the period. Sorahan said Ryanair's third quarter was looking \"relatively good\" with fares ahead of last year by a \"mid-teens\" percent margin. There is no real visibility for the final quarter to end-March, but easing inflation in Europe is a good sign, he said. Ryanair is concerned that up to 10 of 57 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft due to be delivered to the airline by next summer may be delayed until next winter, but the situation was improving, Sorahan said. \"We're in weekly calls with them (Boeing) at the moment. It's a fairly fluid situation. It's starting to get better at this stage, but more to go,\" Sorahan said.",

Local members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union will vote on Saturday on the proposed contract. In May, over 1,000 union members in Racine, Wisconsin, and Burlington, Iowa, walked off their equipment-making jobs after a six-year contract expired at both facilities. UAW local union president in Racine, Yasin Mahdi, where roughly 700 of the striking workers are based, told Reuters that despite prolonged bargaining negotiations, CNH Industrial (CNHI) has barely budged on demands from members for better working conditions and a bump in wages amid rising inflation. It was not immediately clear how CNHI's striking workers in Iowa will vote. A Burlington union representative could not be immediately reached for comment. CNHI declined to comment. The company has upped its initial wage increase offer from 18.5% over the course of three years for non-trade skilled workers, but has fallen short in other areas, including increasing costs for health insurance premiums that would take effect after this year, Mahdi said. \"When you factor in how much insurance is going to go up versus wages, you're losing money,\" he added. The length of the CNHI strike is unusual and well beyond the two-month average in the United States, said Robert Bruno, a labor and employment professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. With a tightening labor market, union workers in the industrial sector for companies such as Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and Deere & Co. (DE.N)New Tab have gone on strike in recent years. \"What we're seeing is union members rejecting contracts at a higher rate and the end result is that they do much better,\" he said.",

Boeing referred questions to the airline which said it had no immediate comment. Airbus declined comment. Reuters reported on Sunday that Air India was close to placing orders approaching 500 jets - including 400 narrowbody models - worth tens of billions of dollars from Airbus and Boeing as it seeks a renaissance under the Tata Group.

Bloomberg reported on Friday that Boeing was closing in on an order for as many as 200 of its 737 MAX jets.

            "text": "Launching a 300-ton plane full of people into the sky and propelling it at 500 miles (805 km) an hour requires a lot of energy. So, taking off without adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere will take some doing. The airline industry, responsible for nearly 3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, has pledgedNew Tab to hit net zero by 2050 to help curb global warming. But with travel demand likely to add to the 100,000 or so flights daily, some worry they could struggle with that goalNew Tab . Airlines say they are optimisticNew Tab . Here are some of the strategies they are looking at: GREEN FUEL The airline industry believes its quickest path to net-zero is replacing jet fuel with “sustainable aviation fuel” (SAF) made from renewable sources, such as plants or used cooking oil. In theory, SAF can cut flight emissions by around 80%, depending on how it is made. But SAF is not widely available because of cost. The United States and other countries are considering subsidies to bring prices down and supplies up. In the meantime, some airlines are blending small amounts into their fuel. There are other concerns, including whether planes can run properly on pure SAF, as opposed to a mix. Engines designed for petroleum-based fuel rely on its oily qualities to lubricate internal parts and protect gaskets and seals. It is unclear if SAF offers that effect on its own. Boeing (BA.N)New Tab is studying the issue and has committed to ensuring its planes are certified for 100% SAF by 2030. Even if SAF can replace petroleum fuel completely, it still only reduces emissions by 80% at best. The rest could be written off with carbon offsets – financial instruments that allow an emitter to pay someone else to cut emissions. Offset credits are generated by investing in clean energy projects, planting trees, or supporting other types of efforts that keep emissions from the atmosphere. Airlines and other industries are already making these investments. But scientific uncertainty as well as a lack of transparency and international quality standards mean it is impossible to be sure those using offsets are cutting the promised emissions. Negotiators at the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow are trying to solve the issue by agreeing on standards for government-run carbon markets, which would likely then inform rules for voluntary ones. But delegates are not sureNew Tab a deal can be struck. United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab has shunned carbon offsets, which its CEO Scott Kirby calls the \"the height of greenwashing\". Instead, UA is betting on direct air capture (DAC), a technology still in development that would suck carbon dioxide directly out of the atmosphere and store it underground. The U.S. airline is a \"small minority\" partner in 1PointFive Inc's project in Texas, which hopes to become the world's first commercial direct air capture facility with a capacity to remove 1 million tons of CO2 from the air annually. The technology has yet to be proven up to scale. And it's expensive, costing hundreds of dollars to capture just one ton of CO2. Several previous carbon capture and storage (CCS) efforts have failedNew Tab . Kirby said he thinks the 1PointFive project will work, but isn't sure if it will be a cost-effective option. Other options being studied include whether battery capacity can be scaled up to power planes, and whether hydrogen fuel made with renewable power can be produced in the quantities needed. The technologies are still far from commercial use, with batteries heavy and hydrogen fuel still unproven in planes. Rolls-Royce held a 15-minute test flight of a small electric plane in September, calling it a \"milestone on the aviation industry’s journey towards decarbonization\". The engine-maker said it expects a market for electric \"flying taxis\" for short distances within a few years, while longer flights would probably need other technologies. As for hydrogen, Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab says it will develop the world's first commercial aircraft fueled by the gas by 2035.",

Reuters first reported on Saturday that L3Harris was nearing the deal to acquire Aerojet. The offer price of $58 per share represents a premium of 5.7% to Aerojet's close on Friday. The deal, expected to be completed in 2023, would create a new segment within L3Harris that would report directly to the company's chief executive. Shares of L3Harris were down 3.8% in afternoon trade on Monday, while those of Aerojet were up 1.5%. Reuters reported last month that L3Harris, formed by the merger of L3 Technologies and Harris Corp in 2019, was among the companies vying to buy Aerojet, which put itself up for sale after antitrust regulators blocked a merger with Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N)New Tab earlier this year. The United States has assisted Ukraine with billions of dollars in military aid, including missiles and air defense systems, driving up demand for missiles as allies also seek to boost their defenses. Aerojet develops and manufactures liquid and solid rocket propulsion and hypersonic engines for space, defense, civil and commercial applications. The market for rockets has also received a leg up from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), one of Aerojet's main customers, which is pursuing moon and deep space missions with renewed vigor. Aerojet makes the RS-25 engines for NASA's launch vehicle, as well as the RL10 engines that power launch vehicles made by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab and Lockheed Martin. L3Harris, which has been investing in the space and cyber industries, is looking to solidify its position among top aerospace and defense firms as one of the leading contractors to the Pentagon.",

            "text": "Citadel, the $51 billion hedge fund founded by billionaire investor Ken Griffin, is moving its global headquarters to Miami from Chicago, becoming the latest investment firm to shift offices to Florida in the wake of the pandemic. Griffin is the wealthiest resident in Illinois with an estimated net worth of $25 billion. The decision to relocate the hedge fund and Citadel Securities, the electronic trading firm, was motivated by Florida's business-friendly climate and tax advantages, and concerns about rising crime rates in Chicago, people familiar with his thinking said. \"I am excited to have recently moved to Miami with my family and look forward to rapidly expanding Citadel in a city so rich in diversity and abounding with energy,\" Griffin wrote to employees announcing the planned move in a note seen by Reuters. \"Miami is a vibrant, growing metropolis that embodies the American Dream.\" The firm follows in the footsteps of prominent hedge fund managers Carl Icahn and Paul Singer whose firms moved to Florida from New York as employees longed for better weather and access to outdoor activities, a huge draw during the pandemic. Florida also does not collect state income tax. Citadel is one of the world's most successful hedge funds and has been headquartered in Chicago for more than three decades. The firm employs 1,000 people at it headquarters, 10% less than two years ago, a statistic that Citadel executives say underscores how tough it is to recruit top talent to Illinois. About 4,000 people work at the firm in 17 offices around the world. Citadel executives have expressed concerns about crime in Chicago, noting a Citadel employee was stabbed a block from the office while walking to work, that someone tried to carjack Griffin's vehicle, and that protests have occurred outside of the Chicago headquarters. The firm's move will deal another blow to Chicago's business community after Boeing (BA.N)New Tab recently said it would move its headquarters to Arlington, Virginia and Caterpillar (CAT.N)New Tab announced plans to relocate to Irving, Texas. And it will likely put a dent in philanthropic giving after Griffin, who was born in Florida, donated more than $600 million to local educational, cultural, medical and civic organizations. At the start of the pandemic, Citadel established a beachhead at the Four Seasons Palm Beach hotel to ensure fluid trading as COVID-19 locked down many businesses.",

Europe's largest low cost carrier last week abruptly ended talks with the U.S. planemakerNew Tab over a new order of the larger 737 MAX 10 jets, worth tens of billions of dollars, due to differences over price. Shares of the airline jumped 7% on Thursday after it raised its passenger growth forecast. \"If we don't do another order until 2025, frankly we couldn't care less. The one great thing about the airline industry is we know there's going to be another crisis in five years' time (to drive down jet prices),\" Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told an analyst call after Ryanair's annual general meeting. The Irish airline, one of Boeing's biggest customers, will keep talking to the planemaker, O'Leary said in an interview, adding that relations between the two remain \"very good\". However, O'Leary has said he is willing to wait years for Boeing to drop its prices and on Thursday he said Ryanair had enough aircraft to fly 225 million passengers a year by 2026, up from 200 million previously forecast. O'Leary told Reuters that to meet that target Ryanair would sell fewer second-hand planes, on top of the planned delivery of 210 of Boeing's 197-seat MAX 200 model over the next five years. It may also buy or lease a small amount of current generation planes, he added. Ryanair had been in talks to order 100 of the 230-seat MAX 10 for delivery from 2026 to 2030 with an option for 100 more before the talks were cancelled, O'Leary said. He added that the boost to its passenger forecast reflected large pent-up demand in Europe and the gaps that have appeared as rivals fail or cut capacity. Ryanair flew 149 million passengers a year before the pandemic and expects to fly close to 100 million in its financial year to the end of March 2022. O'Leary said bookings over the coming months were \"patchy\", with some periods of extraordinary demand around school holidays in October and at Christmas, while current prices were low. However, he said he expected ticket prices for short-haul flights across Europe next summer to be significantly higher than they were before the pandemic because there is about 20% less capacity in the market. Ryanair's shares were up 7% at 16.49 euros by 1130 GMT, and have gained 7.6% since the start of this year.",

The bears - Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and their cub Xiao Qi Ji - hunkered down in crates made of steel and plexiglass that were lifted into a truck and then loaded into a Boeing 777F cargo plane dubbed \"FedEx Panda Express.\" They left in the early afternoon from Dulles International Airport with a load of bamboo, apples and pears to munch on during the 19-hour, 9,000 mile flight. The pandas, accompanied by three zookeepers, will travel to a reserve in China’s mountainous Sichuan province, where an estimated 1,800 pandas are still found in the wild, according to the National Zoo. Zoo director Brandie Smith choked back tears at a brief ceremony ending more than a half century in which pandas have been residents. \"It's been a hard week, but ultimately our focus today is on the safe transport of these animals to China,\" she said. \"It's a moment of joy because this is one more step in 50 years of a successful giant panda conservation program and hopefully the beginning of 50 more years of successful giant panda conservation,\" she said. Mei Xiang, 25, and Tian Tian, 26, arrived at the National Zoo in 2000. Their first three cubs, born between 2005 and 2015, are thriving in China. Xiao Qi Ji - “Little Miracle” in English - was born three years ago, making his mother the oldest giant panda ever to give birth in the U.S. Pandas live about 30 years under human care, but about 15-to-20 years in the wild, the zoo said on its website. The trio, made famous by the zoo's \"Giant Panda Cam\" with more than 100 million views, were part of a fading legacy in which giant pandas served as animal ambassadors. It began in 1972, when the government of China presented two giant pandas as gifts to the U.S. after President Richard Nixon's historic Cold War visit to the communist country. Except for the initial gifts, giant pandas have been leased to U.S. zoos under contracts with the China Wildlife Conservation. In recent years, such contracts have not been extended. The departure of Washington's three bears follows the return of pandas from Memphis and San Diego zoos, leaving only four giant pandas in the U.S. Those animals, residents of Georgia's Zoo Atlanta, are scheduled to return in 2024. It was not clear if or when the zoo will get more pandas. Kimberly Blalock, a young visitor at the National Zoo on Tuesday, was among the last to see the pandas on display in Washington. \"I hope they can come back,\" she said. \"I'm going to miss them and I want to hug them.\"",

On the industrial side, Airbus faces uncertainty over its supply chains but remains confident of its ability to raise narrow-body jet output by 50% over the next three years compared with current output \"cruising past 50\" jets a month, he said. \"It's true that in the short term, we're facing extreme uncertainty and unpredictability all along the supply chain... which means that there are some slippages right now, but they're not structural,\" he told Reuters. Scherer said an embryonic recovery in demand for larger long-haul jets could push that segment of the market out of the doldrums and towards shortages last seen several years ago. \"We could very well be in an undersupply situation on the wide-body side, akin to what we see on the narrow bodies in the mid and second part of this decade,\" Scherer said. He downplayed reports of further possible delays to the A321XLR, Airbus' newest jet that staged a maiden flight last week. Industry sources have said a three-month delay over regulatory hurdles could extend to as much as a year. \"I think it would be highly speculative to throw out numbers on months of delays,\" Scherer said. Boeing (BA.N)New Tab has described the market for the large single-aisle jet as niche. Scherer responded: \"I like that niche. Airbus has sold over 500 of the planes and counting.\" Boeing says the heart of the medium-haul market is in a smaller size where its 737 MAX 8 is the company's best-seller. Scherer was speaking ahead of an International Ar Trasport Association meeting in Doha that coincides with a dispute between Airbus and Qatar Airways over damage to A350 jets. \"Our company is still very engaged in trying to find...an amicable agreement, as we do with with all customers around the world,\" Scherer said, adding A350 safety is \"not in question\". Qatar has grounded over 20 of the planes, saying gaps in lightning protection beneath their eroded paint surface raise unanswered questions over safety, pending deeper analysis. Europe's air regulator last week declared the planes safe, but Qatar's national regulator has grounded jets as problems appear.",

Some previous market tantrums over a looming tightening in policy made central bankers think twice about taking away hefty monetary support.

With inflation raging at 40-year highs, the Fed is unlikely to backtrackNew Tab on its intent to raise interest rates and will almost certainly flag a March rate hike later on Wednesday. Yet, the almost 9% slide in the S&P 500 this month and the flattening of the U.S. yield curve are not good indicators of sentiment towards the economic outlook, and may temper the case for more hawkish stance from the Fed. The fine line between taking action to contain inflation but not tightening policy too fast that it brings the recovery to a quick end, is exactly the line Fed chief Jerome Powell has to walk. Markets will be watching his every step. Meanwhile, odds are split on whether or not the Bank of Canada will hike ratesNew Tab for the first time since 2018 when it meets later in the day. The bank may need to take Omicron's wrath into account while deciding whether to start a tightening campaign geared at taming red-hot inflation. With central banks in the spotlight, Asian stock markets steadied after three sessions of losses. U.S. and European stock futures were higher. Geopolitical tensions were likely to remain in focus after U.S. President Joe Biden said he would consider personal sanctions on President Vladimir Putin if Russia invades UkraineNew Tab , as Western leaders stepped up military preparations and made plans to shield Europe from a potential energy supply shock.

            "text": "Russian aviation veered towards isolation on Wednesday as Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab halted the supply of components and analysts predicted carriers may strip parked planes for parts or be tempted to explore alternative sources to continue flying. Flagship Aeroflot and other carriers faced the Western crackdown as the effects of sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine ripple across the global aviation sector. read more The United States said late on Tuesday that it would follow the European Union and Canada in banning Russian flights in a move that is likely to trigger Russian retaliation. read more Boeing said it had \"suspended major operations\" in Russia, where it also has research and engineering centres. Airbus said it is halting supply of parts and services to Russian airlines but is also analysing whether its Moscow engineering centre could continue providing services to local customers. It did not say what kind of work this might involve. The bans come just as major powers discuss reviving a deal that lifted similar sanctions against Iran, until Washington withdrew in 2018. Sanctions against Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a \"special operation\", will have greater consequences than those on Iran or North Korea, given the size of its market. \"With Western lessors also looking to repossess jets that are operated by Russian carriers, the Russian aviation sector is now on a footing that is similar to North Korea and Iran – and similar to where it was under Soviet rule,\" wrote Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard. Russia accounted for 6% of airline capacity in 2021, according to consultants IBA. Its airlines have a total of 332 Boeing and 304 Airbus jets, or about two thirds of Russia's fleet, Cirium Fleets data shows. How quickly those are starved of parts will depend on how many critical items airlines hold. Jetliners are subject to constant oversight ranging from daily checks to heavy maintenance every six years. While routine problems might not require immediate repairs provided the issue is addressed in a certain number of days, some parts remain essential for a plane to depart. Planes owned by Russian airlines can be flown domestically while they have sufficient parts in stock, but carriers may have trouble getting jets serviced in the shrinking areas of the world still accepting Russian planes, maintenance experts said. Even where parts can be found outside the country, airlines face potential payment difficulties after some Russian banks were barred from the SWIFT international payments system. Unlike Iran's decaying jetliners inherited from decades of U.S. sanctions, Russia has an advanced fleet. \"It will have to create a full-fledged maintenance system for some types of aircraft. But before that... it will need to cannibalise some aircraft for use as spare parts,\" said Oleg Panteleev, head of Russian AviaPort analytical agency. \"Cannibalisation will be possible because the need for the planes will fall,\" Panteleev said. Many airlines re-use parts from their own planes, but there have been complaints in the past that struggling airlines elsewhere have taken parts off leased planes, which are off-limits. Lessors have until March 28 to wind up contracts under EU sanctions, but industry executives have expressed concern over whether Russian airlines and courts would comply. read more Some 515 planes in Russia are leased from foreign companies, according to Cirium. There is no suggestion so far that Russian airlines have removed parts from leased jets without approval. Depending on the length of the crisis, some experts predict airlines may seek alternatives. Chinese parts are already used in some markets on older planes not serving the West, while Iran perfected a system of under-the-table suppliesNew Tab over decades. \"Of course, it would be good for Russia to find suppliers and partners in third countries who would be ready to ensure stable shipments of all necessary components,\" Panteleev said. \"But if these countries say they are afraid of sanctions, Russia would need to search for foreign specialists and create a maintenance system at Russian factories.\" However, using unofficial parts would put valuable jets in a grey zone and make them difficult to finance once the war ends. That is something industry experts say Russia's international carriers, with a young average fleet, would battle to avoid. Maintenance agreements are also at risk. Aeroflot last year signed a long-term agreement with Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company (HAECO), which did not respond to a request for comment. Lufthansa Technik (LHAG.DE)New Tab said it had stopped serving Russian customers involving hundreds of planes. Russian difficulties in sourcing spare parts could affect international airlines that still fly to Russia and sometimes require replacement parts at the destination. Russian airlines will also be barred from taking new Western jets. They have 62 planes on order with Airbus or Boeing. Russia's Sukhoi meanwhile aims to fit its home-grown regional Superjet with Russian engines by 2024.",

            "text": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) levied $6.4 billion in enforcement actions, including $4 billion in penalties, in fiscal 2022, the agency's chair Gary Gensler said on Wednesday. The large number of fines, fees and penalties from about 700 enforcement actions marks a record and underscores the Wall Street regulator's more aggressive stance against corporate wrongdoing under Democratic leadership. The total levied is higher than the previous year's $3.9 billion the SEC obtained from 697 actions and than 2020's record of $4.7 billion across 715 cases, according to a review of SEC's previous enforcement results. Gensler highlighted the SEC's enforcement activity in the year ended September 30 in prepared remarks at a Practicing Law Institute event. The agency is expected to publish its full enforcement report sometime this month. The year's enforcement activity included several large resolutions, including a $675-million penalty against Germany's Allianz SE (ALVG.DE)New Tab to resolve probes over the collapse of a group of investment funds and penalties against major Wall Street banks including Barclays (BARC.L)New Tab , Bank of America, Goldman Sachs (GS.N)New Tab , and JPMorgan (JPM.N)New Tab after staff discussed deals and trades on their personal devices and apps. The year's charges also included $200 million settlement with Boeing Co to over charges it misled investors about its 737 MAX and a fine against BlockFi Lending LLC with failing to register a crypto lending product. Penalties for fraud and misconduct have surged in recent years, but the regulator has historically struggled to collect all the cash from those resolutions. More needs to be done to tackle recidivism and keep the penalties from being a cost of doing business for large institutions, said Dennis Kelleher, president of the Washington-based advocacy group Better Markets. \"Bragging about being the best toll collector on the corporate crime highway is like a police department bragging about the number of speeding tickets it gives to escaping bank robbers – that approach won’t punish, deter, or stop lawbreaking,\" he said in a statement.",

Reuters reported on Wednesday that Texas venture capital investor Matthew Brown was nearing a deal to invest $200 million in the space startup via a private share placement, citing a term sheet Reuters had seen. \"As we disclosed on March 16, the company has taken cash preservation measures as it explores strategic options to secure Virgin Orbit's future,\" Virgin Orbit said in a statement. \"The company can confirm that it is in discussions with interested parties about a potential investment in the company,\" Virgin Orbit added. \"Beyond this, we will not comment on market rumors.\" Without elaborating, Virgin Orbit also acknowledged comments made by Brown on a Thursday interview with CNBC TV. Brown confirmed on CNBC he wants to buy Virgin in a deal he hopes to close by the end of Friday. \"We are in active discussions. In fact, I would say final discussions with the company,\" Brown told CNBC. \"We like the company and we fully plan on transacting with the company within the next 24 hours.\" Brown, who describes himself as a \"space enthusiast\" who has invested in more than 13 space companies, told CNBC he would own Virgin Orbit if the deal closes. He did not confirm the contemplated investment amount, but said the deal would \"inject enough capital to make (Virgin Orbit) cash-flow positive.\" Brown also told CNBC he liked Virgin Orbit's business model. The company launches a rocket carrying a satellite from the wing of a Boeing 747, rather than launching from the ground, allowing for quicker launches according to the company. Brown could not immediately be reached by Reuters to comment. A deal would be a boost of confidence for a company that has grappled with dwindling cash and mounting losses in recent quarters in a highly competitive market. Virgin Orbit said on Wednesday it would resume operations on Thursday and prepare for its next mission by recalling some employees. Virgin Orbit's market capitalization slumped to a record low of $150 million on Tuesday before reports about Brown emerged from more than $3 billion two years ago when it went public through a blank-check deal. On Thursday afternoon, the market capitalization was about $175 million.

            "text": "New orders for U.S.-manufactured capital goods increased in July, but the pace slowed from the prior month, suggesting a moderate rebound in business spending this quarter. The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday also showed solid gains in shipments of these goods. While part of the rise was because businesses are spending more due to higher prices, the data was another sign that the economy continues to grow at a slow pace and was not in recession. \"The absence of a sustained decline in orders suggests that businesses are still investing despite tighter financial market conditions, a drop in sentiment and worries about a recession,\" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.4% last month. Data for June was revised higher to show these so-called core capital goods orders advancing 0.9% instead of 0.7% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders would increase 0.3%. The report added to data on retail sales, industrial production and the labor market in underscoring the economy's resilience. Orders are slowing as the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy campaign to fight inflation dampens demand. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's address on Friday at the annual Jackson Hole global central banking conference in Wyoming could shed more light on whether the U.S. central bank can engineer an economic slowdown without triggering a recession. Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, remains supported by still-low inventories of long-lasting manufactured goods like motor vehicles. There were increases in orders of machinery, fabricated metal products as well as computers and electronic products in July. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell as did those for primary metals. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar was largely unchanged against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. Core capital goods shipments climbed 0.7% after advancing 0.8% in June. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product measurement. Higher prices are making it harder to get a clean read of the equipment spending data, which is not adjusted for inflation. There is also uncertainty over which price index the government will use to adjust the data for inflation. The producer price index for private capital equipment increased 0.5% in July which would imply that the inflation-adjusted core capital goods orders were negative last month. But shipments are running ahead of inflation, putting equipment spending on a moderate growth path early in the third quarter. \"Lower commodity prices suggest the potential for a lower equipment investment price index in the third quarter and consequently more of the nominal strength to work its way through to measured real growth,\" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citigroup in New York. Business spending on equipment declined at a 2.7% annualized rate in the second quarter, the most in two years. That, together with a slower pace of inventory accumulation relative to the prior two quarters, helped to weigh down GDP. The economy contracted 1.3% in the first half of the year. Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, were unchanged in July after increasing 2.2% in June. They were restrained by a 0.7% decline in orders for transportation equipment. Orders for civilian aircraft soared 14.5%. They were, however, offset by a 49.8% plunge in orders for defense aircraft. Boeing (BA.N)New Tab reported on its website that it had received 130 aircraft orders compared to only 50 in June. Orders for motor vehicles and parts rose 0.2% last month. Motor vehicle production remains constrained by a global semiconductor chip shortage. Durable goods shipments rose 0.4% after increasing 0.3% in June. Unfilled durable goods orders advanced 0.7%, while inventories gained 0.2%. \"Measuring inventories is particularly difficult in inflationary times, but the inventory to sales ratio as reported has not increased over the last year and supports the view that inventories remain tight,\" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. While manufacturing is hanging on, the stiffest run of interest rate increases since the 1980s is having a significant impact on the housing market. In a separate report on Wednesday, the National Association of Realtors reported that its Pending Home Sales Index, based on signed contracts, dropped 1.0% to 89.8 last month, the lowest level since April 2020. Contracts have declined in eight of the last nine months. read more But, with house prices still elevated as affordable homes remain scarce, a housing market collapse is unlikely. \"We are not at risk of a housing crash, conditions are nothing like what the market experienced during the last housing crisis,\" said Nicole Bachaud, a senior economist at Zillow in Seattle. \"We should not confuse the inability to buy a home with a lack of desire to buy.\"",

            "text": "A dispute between Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and Qatar Airways over paint and surface flaws on A350 jets stretches beyond the Gulf, with at least five other airlines raising concerns since the high-tech model entered service, according to documents seen by Reuters and several people with direct knowledge of the matter. Qatar's national carrier has grounded 20 of its 53 A350s, saying it is acting on orders from its local regulator, until reasons for what witnesses describe as the blistered and pock-marked appearance of some of its A350s can be confirmed. Airbus says there is no risk to the A350's safety - a point echoed by the other airlines, which have not grounded any jets and describe the issue as \"cosmetic.\" The planemaker said in response to queries from Reuters there had been some problems with \"early surface wear\" that in some cases had made visible a sub-layer of mesh designed to absorb lightning, which it is working to fix. Three people with direct knowledge of the situation said that at Qatar Airways and at least one other airline the mesh had in some instances itself developed gaps, leaving the carbon-fibre fuselage exposed to possible weather or other damage. The A350, in service since 2015, is designed with ample protection to resist storms and is deployed around the world with high reliability, Airbus said in an emailed statement. Asked about gaps in the mesh, it said some airlines were subject to higher swings in temperatures than others, apparently referring, for example, to desert conditions in Qatar. Qatar Airways has called for a definitive cause to be identified and a permanent fix that satisfies its regulator. The Qatar Civil Aviation Authority declined to comment. Two people familiar with the grounding decision said it was based on ongoing uncertainty over the cause and impact of surface degradation and gaps in lightning protection. Airbus says it has found a root cause, but sources with two affected airlines said they had not been notified of one. The row has set the clock ticking on a compensation battle that sources said could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars after Qatar Airways halted deliveries of 23 more A350s on order. The clashNew Tab between two of aviation's most powerful players became public in May, six months after Qatar Airways sent an A350 to be stripped and repainted in special livery for the FIFA World Cup to be held in the Gulf state next year. But what for months had been widely presented as an isolated issue related to Qatar's severe heat is more widespread, according to a private maintenance message board used by Airbus and A350 operators and reviewed by Reuters. Messages show Finnair (FIA1S.HE)New Tab , which operates in the colder north, raised paint concerns as early as 2016, and reported in October 2019 that damage had spread below to the anti-lightning mesh. Cathay Pacific (0293.HK)New Tab , Etihad, Lufthansa (LHAG.DE)New Tab and Air France (AIRF.PA)New Tab - acting in its capacity as maintenance provider for Air Caraibes - also complained of paint damage. Following those previously unreported problems, Airbus last year set up a \"multi-functional task force,\" while studying new material for lightning protection in future A350 jets, two people familiar with the matter said. Finnair, Cathay Pacific and Lufthansa confirmed some of their A350s had suffered what they described as cosmetic damage. Air Caraibes said it and sister airline French Bee had seen \"no major paint problems,\" and especially none regarding safety. Air France said its own A350s had operated normally since it began flying them in 2021 and declined to comment on Air Caraibes. Etihad declined to comment. To be sure, Qatar Airways has had disputes with suppliers in the past before reaching compromise deals. Its CEO Akbar Al Baker has periodically criticised both Airbus and U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N)New Tab over perceived manufacturing and strategy errors. Analysts say the dispute coincides with efforts by many airlines to reduce their exposure to long-haul jets following the pandemic. Gulf industry sources deny commercial motives for the grounding, noting Qatar badly needs jets for the World Cup. Airbus is also not alone in facing problems. Boeing has had paint issues and a phenomenon known as rivet rash, or flecks of missing paint, on its competing 787s. A spokesperson said it was not safety-related and was being resolved. However, the unusual partial grounding by Qatar comes at a sensitive time for Airbus as it races to meet an end-year delivery target and as Qatar Airways studies offers from BoeingNew Tab to replace a fleet of 34 freighters. read more In October 2016, a year after becoming the A350's first European operator, Finnair reported paint damage, according to the message board. It later complained \"paint is in very bad condition.\" Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific, which uses a different paint supplier, reported similar problems the same month. Almost a year later, it said it \"continue(s) to experienced paint peeling problems on multiple aircraft.\" In one posting, it disclosed that problems had been found on an A350 just two weeks after delivery. \"We can confirm that we have experienced some issues with A350 painting, and have been working together with ... Airbus to solve these issues,\" a Finnair spokesperson said, adding the problem was \"cosmetic, but naturally unfortunate.\" Cathay Pacific confirmed some of its A350s had experienced \"to some extent cosmetic deterioration.\" The issue has been fully investigated and there is no safety impact, it said. By October 2017, the messages show, Lufthansa had also found areas of peeling, some spanning more than a square metre. Lufthansa said occasional cosmetic defects had been corrected and that safety had never been affected. Paint has played a major branding and diplomatic role in the jet age, projecting the image of airlines and nations across the world. But a switch to new lightweight jets brought a hitch. When Airbus 15 years ago launched the A350, it chose to follow Boeing's new 787 in using carbon-fibre instead of metal. Experts say the lighter jets consume less fuel but are harder to deck out in a way that makes paint stick. The new jets also need a layer of metallic mesh to dissipate lightning strikes because carbon-fibre is not conductive. Finally, unlike metal, carbon does not expand and shrink as temperatures change. Yet paint does, resulting in a tug of war between plane and paint that can cause peeling over time. Problems reported by Qatar Airways and some - though far from all - other A350 operators suggest this is happening earlier than expected, two people familiar with the design said. The problem may have been compounded by the paint's especially weak adhesion to titanium rivets, they added. Some industry experts have questioned whether other manufacturing flaws may also have contributed to the problem. Pictures submitted on the message board by Finnair in 2019, seen by Reuters, appear to show corroded or missing mesh known as Expanded Copper Foil. Finnair and Airbus declined to comment on the photos, but Airbus officials said that particular problem may have stemmed from an early production issue, since resolved. \"We have seen no effect on the structure of the aircraft and operators continue to fly with high levels of operational reliability,\" A350 Chief Engineer Miguel Angel LLorca Sanz said of the broader paint issue. \"This is not at all affecting the lightning strike protection due to the substantial (safety) margins ... It is not at all an airworthiness issue,\" he said in an interview. Airbus is nonetheless looking at updating the lightning system to a more flexible material called Perforated Copper Foil, industry sources said. Airbus confirmed it is one option under review. That still leaves a war of words over existing planes sitting idle with their windows taped up in Qatar. Photographs obtained by Reuters show cracked or missing paint and exposed or corroded lightning protection on at least two of the jets. Now regulators must try to break an impasse over whether that kind of damage is within the allowable margins for dealing with lightning, which Airbus insists would still wash safely over the jet. That in turn may determine whether compensation clauses will be triggered. While European regulators have said there is no evidence of safety risk, Qatar is pressing for deeper analysis and shows no immediate signs of backing down.",

            "text": "Boeing (BA.N)New Tab is lifting production of its bestselling 737 narrow-body jet, but executives said Wednesday that it will take time for its facilities to stabilize production, even as they set their sights on future rate boosts. Shares of the company rose 7%, at one point hitting a 1-1/2-year high after Boeing also posted second-quarter results above Wall Street expectations. The planemaker is now transitioning its 737 production line - including the MAX models that make up the vast majority of 737 production - to building 38 jets per month, up from 31, the company said. \"That's a big important move, and there'll be subsequent rate breaks beyond that,\" said CEO Dave Calhoun. \"All of that is going to play into a margin trajectory that's going to start to look a lot more normal.\" Calhoun later added the company is already in \"prep mode\" to raise monthly 737 production to 42, but wouldn't specify whether Boeing would do so in 2023, as Boeing Commercial Airplanes head Stan Deal told Bloomberg TV in June. And while Calhoun said he would \"love\" to ramp up 737 production from its stated monthly target of 50 to 60 jets, Boeing needs to ensure production lines remain stable as rate increases in 2024. Boeing has signaled to suppliers that it will lift 737 production to 47 a month in June 2024, Reuters previously reported. While analysts pressed Boeing executives on production increases, Calhoun warned that continued supply chain constraints could persist for the foreseeable future, stating that, \"Everyone is fighting for the next part.\" The impacts of a 737 quality issue at supplier Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N)New Tab , a work stop at Spirit and recent collapse of a railway bridge used to transport 737 fuselages would be contained in the third quarter, but could delay \"a few\" airplane deliveries, Calhoun said. Higher deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner helped spur a rise in revenue in Boeing's commercial planes division. However, Chief Financial Officer Brian West said commercial margins would show improvement but remain negative in the third-quarter. \"The overall outlook is unchanged, but the results from the Commercial Aerospace division is encouraging, particularly in light of the ongoing supply chain challenges,\" Third Bridge analyst Peter McNally said. \"Boeing's execution has improved, and it will need to continue on this path to turn the corner on sustained profitability.\" Margins at its defense business, however, were negative amid cost overruns. The company took a total of $514 million in charges related to the space capsule Starliner after its launch was indefinitely delayed in June, as well as for supply chain costs on the T-7 training jet and a schedule delay for the MQ-25 tanker drone. \"Our defense margins have got to get better next year, period, full stop,\" West said. The push to build 38 737s a month comes amid heightened travel demand as airlines seek to grow their fleets post-pandemic. Boeing expects to deliver most of the 228 MAXs in its inventory by the end of 2024, making it critical that Boeing step up production. Of the inventory jets, 85 are for Chinese customers, and 55 MAXs were originally slated for Chinese airlines and have been remarketed, West said. For the second quarter, Boeing reported free cash flow of $2.58 billion, compared with a cash burn of $182 million a year ago. The adjusted loss was 82 cents per share. Analysts polled by Refinitiv were expecting a wider loss of 88 cents per share. Boeing's revenue rose 18% to $19.75 billion, beating expectations of $18.45 billion. Boeing reiterated its plan to generate $3 billion to $5 billion in free cash flow this year, as well as to deliver at least 400 single-aisle 737s and 70 787 Dreamliners in 2023.",

In an email to staff seen by Reuters, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said the company had named Steve Biegun as senior vice president of global public policy to \"deepen our efforts in developing and executing a strategic global public policy plan while helping us strengthen important relationships with key stakeholders in the U.S. and around the world. Boeing has more than 130 737 MAX airplanes in inventory for Chinese carriers but has been unable to deliver them amid U.S. China geopolitical tensions. State-owned China Eastern and China Southern last week said in filings they would resume taking delivery of the Boeing 737 MAX this year.

            "text": "Boeing's (BA.N)New Tab troubles with its 737 MAX jets are upending the aerospace industry's 2024 plans, changing airlines' fleet and expansion goals as U.S. regulators froze production of the best-selling jets. The Federal Aviation Administration ramped up scrutiny of Boeing after a frightening Jan. 5 incident when a cabin panel tore off of an Alaska Airlines jet mid-flight. The plane landed safely with only minor injuries to people on board - but that experience has forced the industry to grapple with problems with Boeing's manufacturing and quality-control processes. The FAA on Wednesday froze increases in production of the single-aisle 737 MAX due to the issues, which have frustrated executives dependent on Boeing, one of only two major global plane manufacturers. \"Boeing needs to get their act together,\" said American Airlines (AAL.O)New Tab CEO Robert Isom. \"It is hard enough running an airline. We need quality product, and that's what we demand.\" The FAA's order means Boeing can continue producing MAX jets at its current monthly rate, but it cannot increase that rate. It offered no estimate of how long the limitation would last and did not specify the number of planes Boeing can produce each month. The FAA's unprecedented intervention in production schedules could further delay some deliveries of new planes to airlines and hurt suppliers already reeling from an earlier MAX crisis and the pandemic. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told Reuters on Thursday that he supported the FAA decision. \"We all want safe airplanes. This is a safe airplane,\" he said in Washington, where he has been meeting with U.S. legislators. Some airlines could be significantly impacted by any freeze on higher production, a senior industry source said, though many have already factored in some delays as aerospace firms continue to recover from the pandemic. Several U.S. carriers said on Thursday they had adjusted their plans for 2024. Alaska Air Group (ALK.N)New Tab , the operator of the 737 MAX 9 that suffered the mid-air incidentNew Tab , forecast a $150 million profit hit in 2024 from the aircraft grounding that has lasted nearly three weeks. It also cast doubt on its capacity growth plans for the year, citing the grounding and \"the potential for future delivery delays.\" Southwest Airlines (LUV.N)New Tab altered its fleet plans for 2024 due to the supply-chain challenges and uncertainty over certification of the smaller MAX 7. Before the Jan. 5 accident, Southwest was expecting the MAX 7 to gain certification by April. CEO Bob Jordan, however, said on a Thursday earnings call he has \"absolute confidence\" that Boeing will work its way through and \"come out of this a better company.\" Senator Tammy Duckworth, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee's air safety subcommittee, told reporters after a meeting with Calhoun that she had asked the Boeing CEO to withdraw a request to exempt the MAX 7 from certain regulations so it could attain FAA certification. Calhoun said he would consider it but made no promises, according to Duckworth. Texas-based American has 20 MAX planes on order for deliveries this year. Chief Financial Officer Devon May told Reuters that the FAA's order may have a \"modest\" impact on those deliveries. American is looking to place a new order for planes for deliveries in 2027 and beyond. May said the company is talking to Boeing, Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and Embraer (EMBR3.SA)New Tab for the new order, but is mindful of Boeing's ongoing issues. \"We absolutely take current events into consideration as we're going through our analysis of this order,\" May said in an interview. United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab has 100 MAX deliveries scheduled for this year, according to regulatory filings. It warned of a wider-than-expected first-quarter loss due to the grounding, and CEO Scott Kirby said the company would also build a new fleet plan because of Boeing's delays. The FAA did allow grounded MAX 9 planes to return to service once inspections were done, a relief to U.S. MAX 9 operators Alaska and United Airlines, which had been forced to cancel thousands of flights and aim to begin returning the planes to service on Friday. Panama's Copa Airlines (CPA.N)New Tab started flying the grounded aircraft again on Thursday, a spokesperson for the company said. Boeing on Thursday paused production for 15 hours at the Renton, Washington-area factory where it makes the 737 MAX for a \"quality stand-down.\" During the event, about 10,000 employees gathered in small teams to identify quality and safety improvements that could be put in place in various work areas around the facility, Boeing said. Boeing shares closed down 5.7% on Thursday in a volatile session for the sector, while supplier Spirit Aerosystems (SPR.N)New Tab fell 7.9%. Shares of Alaska closed up 4.5%, United's gained 5.2%, while Southwest's fell 2.3% and American rose 10.3%. Boeing is seeking to increase production of the 737 MAX family to keep pace with demand and close a gap in the market with Airbus. Analysts have expressed concerns that extra scrutiny of Boeing factories would temper production increases for the smaller and more widely sold MAX 8, a key source of cash for Boeing and many suppliers. Boeing's latest 737 master schedule, which sets the production pace for suppliers, calls for production to rise between now and late 2025, Reuters reported in December. However, Boeing's own production can lag the supplier master schedule. The FAA's decision could impact plans to start a new 737 MAX production line in Everett, Washington, by mid-2024. The line, set to be the fourth 737 line overall and the first outside its Renton plant in suburban Seattle, is needed to meet strong demand. Boeing declined to comment on any potential impact on the Everett line.",

            "text": "French jet engine maker Safran (SAF.PA)New Tab posted higher first-half earnings and raised some forecasts as airlines bought more spare parts to serve a recovery in air travel, but warned supply chain problems could last well into 2023. The world's third largest aerospace supplier, whose products range from wheels to wiring and commercial engines to thrusters for satellites, said recurring operating profit rose 59% to 1.047 billion euros ($1.1 billion) as revenue increased 24% to 8.56 billion. It upped full-year forecasts for revenue to 18-2-18.4 billion euros from 18.0-18.2 billion and for free cashflow to 2.4 billion euros from 2.0 billion. First-half free cashflow more than doubled to 1.665 billion euros as advances poured in for Rafale fighters, for which Safran builds the M88 engines. Together with General Electric (GE.N)New Tab , Safran co-owns the world's largest civil jet engine maker by the number of units sold, CFM International, which supplies Airbus and Boeing. Both planemakers are receiving fewer engines than planned this year. Safran suggested supply chain problems delaying engine deliveries could last well into next year. \"Problems with the supply chain will unfortunately continue and will probably extend into 2023 and may even last until the end of 2023,\" Chief Executive Olivier Andries told reporters. \"It is to adapt to the reality of the situation that yesterday you heard (Airbus CEO) Guillaume Faury talk about adapting his plan for production increases in 2022 and 2023, without of course abandoning the long-term goal of reaching high production levels,\" Andries said. Airbus said on Wednesday it would reach an interim target of 65 narrow-body jets a month six months later than planned, in early 2024, but stuck to its end-target of 75 a month in 2025. read more Safran's widely watched civil aftermarket - or demand for spare parts and services - rose 47% in dollar terms in the first half. That is mainly the result of demand for spare parts for the CFM56, the predecessor to the LEAP engine which powers all Boeing 737 MAX and about half of the Airbus A320neo fleet for which CFM competes with Pratt & Whitney (RTX.N)New Tab . Demand for travel on these workhorse, medium-haul jets is increasing everywhere except China, Safran said, adding demand related to wide-body jets was growing more slowly. Delayed deliveries of Boeing's 787 squeezed Safran's wiring and landing gear activities, though Boeing said on Wednesday it was close to ending a year-old drought in 787 deliveries. Safran's loss-making aircraft seats business is also suffering from supply chain gaps and cost overruns, while a recovery in other cabin equipment is on track, it said. GE on Tuesday posted higher quarterly profit led by its jet engine business, but said it too faced supply-chain issues. read more ($1 = 0.9800 euros)",

Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said things have begun to stabilise. Other senior executives see a glimmer of hope. But there is an emerging consensus that the industry’s sprawling supply chain - strained by rising costs, parts shortages and a scarcity of skilled labor in the wake of the pandemic - will have to be remade before it can recover fully, a process that will take years. \"I can't stress enough the tsunami that it (the pandemic) created in our supply chain. The good news is traffic is back,\" the CEO of engine maker CFM International Gael Meheust told reporters ahead of the show. Smaller suppliers that took on debt during the pandemic and are now struggling to fund new capacity remain a chief concern. \"The issue now is deep down in the supply chain, tier-three suppliers and lower, where the investment and headcount required for the demand picture makes them very nervous and makes their lenders very nervous,\" said Andy Cronin, CEO of lessor Avolon. Much of the response involves putting out fires one by one and discussing priority lists that can change month by month. \"There are a lot of smaller and medium sized companies for whom COVID was a real challenge,\" added Mike Madsen, CEO of supplier Honeywell Aerospace (HON.O)New Tab . \"Helping them get back to, and now above, 2019 production levels is where all the focus is.\" Labor shortages are hurting the whole ecosystem from new assembly to repair shops as demand rebounds for travel and planes. \"Every day we get a call from somebody in aerospace asking for help in fixing their supply chain,\" said Eric Bernardini, a managing director at U.S. consultancy AlixPartners. Among the items recently flagged as a concern are weather radar and emergency locator transmitters (ELT) for both Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab narrowbody jets, two industry sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. A spokesperson for manufacturer Honeywell said \"we are not aware of any delayed aircraft deliveries related to either of these product lines\". Airbus and Boeing declined specific comment. Airbus said it was monitoring supplies closely. Boeing said it was working with suppliers to address industry-wide challenges. Speaking separately, Madsen said Honeywell saw an overall improvement in the \"electrical part of the supply base,\" as less demand for consumer products frees up more capacity. Large suppliers are looking at bringing some work in-house. \"We're looking at it more broadly than we ever have in probably the last 20 years,\" Madsen said. Consolidation could also play a role. When Connecticut-based Whitcraft Group and Paradigm Precision merged to form Pursuit Aerospace in February, they only made a single part in common. Whitcraft had no facilities to make castings but was able to shift work to a Paradigm casting facility in Tunisia. Paradigm, in turn, was able to shift forging work to Whitcraft. \"We're able to move some of the buy we had with outside parties into ourselves,\" said Pursuit Aerospace CEO Doug Folsom. Airbus' Faury, who also heads France’s Gifas aerospace industry association, said there had been almost 80 M&A moves in France alone since 2020 to support the very smallest companies. M1 Composites Technology, which manufactures and repairs parts like radar enclosures, more than doubled the size of its Montreal-based factory during the pandemic but still struggles with parts procurement. \"The supply chain can't just get back to 2019, it has to be better than 2019,” M1 president Lorenzo Marandola said.",

            "text": "A piece of fuselage tore off the left side of an Alaska Airlines-operated Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 737 MAX 9 jet as it climbed following takeoff from Portland, Oregon, en route to Ontario, California, forcing pilots to turn back and land safely with all 171 passengers and six crew on board. The panel that tore off is a plug put in place on some MAX 9s instead of an additional emergency exit, but not every plane is manufactured in such a way. As Alaska Air (ALK.N)New Tab Flight 1282 reached just over 16,000 feet on Friday, the panel tore off from the side of the jet, leaving a neat, refrigerator-sized, rectangular hole in the aircraft. The pilot immediately signaled that the plane would have to land. The 737 MAX 9, currently Boeing's largest single-aisle plane, can seat up to 220 people. It includes an optional extra door to allow for the approved number of evacuation paths whenever carriers opt to install the maximum number of seats. Planes that do not opt for additional seating can replace that door with a panel, or plug. Door plugs have been used to adapt aircraft and offer flexible layouts across the industry for years. Of the 200-plus 737 MAX 9 planes Boeing has delivered, 171 have this panel in place of a door. In the United States, the carriers using that panel are United (UAL.O)New Tab and Alaska. Other carriers that have grounded planes include Panama's Copa Airlines (CPA.N)New Tab , Aeromexico and Turkish Airlines. The fuselage for Boeing 737s is made by Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N)New Tab , which separated from Boeing in 2005. Spirit is one of two suppliers that makes the plug doors on the MAX 9, but Boeing also has a key role in the plug installation process. The installation is a two-tier process involving both manufacturing at Spirit's giant fuselage plant in Wichita, Kansas, and a Boeing factory outside Seattle, the sources said. As part of the production process, Spirit builds fuselages for 737s and sends them by train with the special door assembly “semi-rigged,” according to a source familiar with production. At its Renton, Washington, plant, Boeing typically removes the pop-out door and uses the gap to load interiors. Then, the part is put back and the installation is completed. Finally, the hull is pressurized to 150% to make sure everything is working correctly. The process means that finding out where any flaw was introduced during assembly may not be clear-cut, sources told Reuters.",

            "text": "El Al Israel Airlines (ELAL.TA)New Tab reported a fourth quarter net profit and forecast that annual revenue will jump 75% by 2028 as travel is rebounding strongly from the pandemic and the carrier plans to expand routes to Asia. Chief Executive Dina Ben-Tal Ganancia said El Al was looking to resume flights to India and add flights to Australia, and possibly the Philippines, Singapore and Maldives at some point, and plans to expand its Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 787 fleet to 22 by 2028 from 16 currently. Helped by a $9 million capital gain, Israel's flag carrier said it earned $8.5 million between October and December, compared with a $110 million loss in the same period a year earlier and a $31 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2019, before the pandemic hit travel. It was the first time since 2015 that El Al has posted a fourth-quarter profit. Revenue jumped to $561 million in the final three months of 2022 from $265 million in the same period a year earlier - when Israel still had strict travel restrictions in place due to COVID-19 - and topping the $518 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. \"You see what we call revenge tourism and there is more demand than supply,\" Ben-Tal Ganancia told Reuters on the sidelines of a news conference. She noted that the pandemic allowed El Al - which changed ownership in 2020, received government bailouts and slashed its workforce to 4,400 from 6,300 - to become more efficient. Between strong demand and cutting costs she said: \"That is a very good formula for a successful quarter, and more to come.\" For all of 2022, El Al recorded revenue of $2 billion, up from $857 million in 2021. It forecast annual revenue of $3.5 billion by 2028. El Al's shares rose 2.4% in afternoon trading in Tel Aviv. The number of passengers at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv jumped 200% last year to 4.2 million, according to Israel Airports Authority data, as travel restrictions were lifted, but El Al's market share at the airport slipped to 22% from 23% in 2021. Ben-Tal Ganancia said El Al was targeting 7.5 million passengers a year at Ben Gurion in five years' time, or a 24% market share. It has a 33% share on North American routes. Last week, El Al received permission to fly over Oman and has begun using a new corridor over Saudi Arabia and Oman that saves some 2 1/2 hours of flight time to Asia. Ben-Tal Ganancia also said El Al was in talks with a U.S. carrier to form a joint venture but declined to give details. \"I hope that we will see results within a couple of months,\" she said. The new faster route to Asia will still bring El Al flights near Iran but Ben-Tal Ganancia believes the routes are safe and there are contingency plans in the event of mechanical issues.",

            "text": "Many airlines will be unable to meet looming U.S. deadlines to retrofit airplane altimeters to ensure they are not susceptible to 5G wireless interference, the world's biggest airline trade body warned authorities, saying it could impact the summer international travel season. In a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, seen by Reuters, International Air Transport Association (IATA) Director General Willie Walsh said \"many operators will not make the proposed July 2023 (and in some cases the March 2023) retrofit deadline owing to supply chain issues, certification delays, and unavoidable logistical challenges.\" The letter from the IATA, which represents more than 100 carriers that fly to the United States, was dated Feb. 2 and also sent to the chief executives of Boeing (BA.N)New Tab , Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and other aerospace manufacturers. \"It is critical that we acknowledge and accept that fact and move collectively to change our approach to this issue now, before many carriers are unable to continue to serve the U.S. market during the peak summer travel season,\" the letter added. The FAA last month said it was proposing a requirement that passenger and cargo aircraft in the United States have 5G C-Band-tolerant radio altimeters or approved filters by early 2024. Concerns that 5G service could interfere with airplane altimeters, which give data on a plane's height above the ground and are crucial for bad-weather landing, led to disruptions at some U.S. airports last year involving international carriers. The Transportation Department did not comment, while the FAA said in response to request for comment on the letter \"the FAA has made its position clear.\" Verizon (VZ.N)New Tab and AT&T (T.N)New Tab in June voluntarily agreed to delay some C-Band 5G usage until July 1, 2023 as air carriers work to retrofit airplanes to ensure that they will not face interference. The proposed airworthiness directive is similar to one that took effect in December 2021, prohibiting passenger and cargo flight operations in the vicinity of 5G C-Band wireless transmitters unless the FAA specifically approved them. The December 2021 FAA directive relied on the voluntary agreement. The FAA, Verizon and AT&T are now negotiating to reach a new agreement that seeks to extend some voluntary mitigations beyond July 1, sources told Reuters. The FAA is also proposing a requirement that airlines revise airplane flight manuals to prohibit low-visibility landings after June 30 unless retrofits have been completed on that airplane. Some airlines have questioned the FAA's cost estimates. The FAA estimated last month the retrofits will cost the industry $26 million and of 7,993 airplanes covered by the directive and the FAA estimates that almost 7,000 airplanes \"are already equipped or are being retrofitted. The FAA plans to hold a briefing on Capitol Hill Tuesday on the 5G discussions for the House Transportation committee said Representative Rick Larsen, the top Democrat on the committee. Airlines for America, a trade group representing American Airlines (AAL.O)New Tab , Delta Air Lines (DAL.N)New Tab , United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab and others, said last month \"carriers are working diligently to ensure fleets are equipped with compliant radio altimeters, but global supply chains continue to lag behind current demand. Any government deadline must consider this reality.\"",

            "text": "Ryanair (RYA.I)New Tab aims to boost profit by 10% this year after almost record earnings for its last financial year, CEO Michael O'Leary said on Monday, and it may do better if rival airlines' \"irrationally exuberant\" summer fare forecasts are right. Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers said it expects 10% traffic growth this year to more than offset a 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) fuel bill rise as it posted slightly better than expected post-tax profit of 1.43 billion euros. O'Leary said robust demand showed customers were treating travel as essential this summer and that fares would grow by a double digit percentage. However, he was not sure if they would hit the 20% to 30% range competitors are forecasting. \"If traffic is growing by 10%, we aim to deliver that type of profit growth as well. It could be better than that if our competitors are correct,\" O'Leary said on an analyst call. \"30 years of pain in this industry has taught me to be cautious when my competitors are irrationally exuberant.\" Ryanair shares, up 27% so far this year, were 2.5% higher by 1145 GMT. The low cost carrier stands to gain more from rising fares due to plans to operate 25% more flights than pre-COVID levels in the peak summer months when European short-haul capacity is set to be 5-10% below pre-pandemic levels. O'Leary cautioned that he was not entirely sure if demand would remain strong with consumer spending strained and that winter and early 2024 may be more challenging. However, a large backlog of aircraft deliveries is likely to constrain European capacity growth for at least four more years and create \"enormous growth opportunities\" for Ryanair as it adds 110 new Boeing (BA.N)New Tab jets over the next three summers. Boeing delivery delays could push some of its growth into the lower yielding second half of this year and require capacity to be trimmed judiciously, he said, with the carrier expecting to be short of up to 10 new jets in June and July. Finance chief Neil Sorahan told Reuters that the Irish airline remained comfortable it would increase passenger numbers to 185 million from a record 168.6 million in the past financial year. The delivery delays could potentially reduce first-half passenger numbers by 750,000, he said. O'Leary expects all the aircraft needed for summer 2024 to arrive by the end of next May or early June and that deliveries will be \"smoother\" next summer. Ryanair's full-year post-tax profit beat the 1.4 billion euros analysts expected, as well as its own forecasts and almost topped the record 1.45 billion euros achieved in 2018. It said a large chunk was due to being \"fortuitously\" hedged on fuel cost. The company made a loss of 355 million euros in last year's pandemic-hit financial year but its turnaround.

The 1.2% increase contrasted with the 6.3% growth Boeing forecast last year, which made China a bright spot in the aviation market at the height of coronavirus lockdowns worldwide. read more Earlier this month, Boeing revised up long-term forecasts for global airplane demand on the back of a strong recovery in commercial air travel in domestic markets like the United States. read more \"There are promising opportunities to significantly expand international long-haul routes and air freight capacity,\" said Richard Wynne, managing director of China marketing at Boeing's commercial arm. \"Longer-term, there is the potential for low-cost carrier growth to further build on single-aisle demand.\" China's domestic aviation market, although still vulnerable to sporadic local COVID-19 outbreaks, has more or less rebounded to pre-COVID levels, but the country's borders remain virtually closed, with the number of international flights only 2% of pre-COVID levels. Boeing projected a need for nearly 6,500 new single-aisle airplanes over the next 20 years, while China's widebody fleet, including passenger and cargo models, will require 1,850 new planes, accounting for 20% of total deliveries. Air freight market has become a bright spot for Boeing in China as e-commerce demand booms, even as the U.S. planemaker struggles with sales of passenger jets due to trade tensions and the grounding of its 737 MAX. read more China's aviation authority, the first regulator to ground 737 MAX following two deadly crashes, has yet to approve the return of service for the aircraft in the country. China accounts for a quarter of Boeing's orders of all aircraft. China will also need nearly $1.8 trillion worth of commercial services for its aircraft fleet over the 20-year period, company said.",

            "text": "Boeing Co's (BA.N)New Tab steady climb out of successive crises - among the worst in U.S. corporate history - gained momentum last week when it won the 2021 jet order raceNew Tab against rival Airbus SE (AIR.PA)New Tab on an adjusted basis with a 737 MAX sales blitz. But closely watched orders and deliveriesNew Tab have underscored the industrial and regulatory currents still facing its bigger 787 Dreamliner and 777X flagships - issues that have left Boeing fighting concurrent battles on both sides of the Atlantic. Regulators in Europe are challenging the safety net built in to 777X flight controls and deliveries of the 787 are expected to remain frozen until around April as U.S. regulators review production flaws, senior industry and government sources said. The pressure surrounding two of the world's largest passenger jets highlights the immediate challenge to Boeing in the aftermath of fatal MAX crashes and the pandemic, though the rest of the industry is also bracing for a regulatory crackdown. \"There is such nervousness among the regulators who make these decisions, who sign off on these things, that they are missing something,\" one senior air safety expert told Reuters. \"The reason for that is the aftermath of the MAX crisisNew Tab . What you now have is engineers looking at things differently than they ever had before,\" he said. Initially designed and overseen by the same generation of engineers and U.S. regulators who oversaw the MAX, the upgrade to the large 777 has captured the attention of an increasingly assertive European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). EASA and Boeing are locked in a deeper than usual debate over engineering that will determine whether extra safeguards are needed for the jet's flight control system, the people said. The European agency takes a back seat to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in certifying U.S. airplanes but its role as the other leading global regulator gives it a powerful say. EASA has laid out an approach that could effectively force Boeing to add an extra fallback to guarantee that a single electronic failure cannot trigger simultaneous outages - a setup known as \"dissimilarity.\" Alternatively, Boeing could try to prove that the current system is safe through thorough analysis. A major factor in the two MAX crashes that killed 346 people was a single point of failure embedded in the flight controls. Although the decades-old architecture at the core of the 737 is radically different from the algorithmic brains of the 777, EASA's approach reflects the intense attention given to backups. Boeing disagrees with EASA's indirect call for additional safeguards, arguing it would amount to having two systems provided by two separate suppliers running in parallel and risk introducing new problems by adding complexity, the people said. It is crunching data from over 1,600 hours of flight tests to build its own analysis. Boeing and regulators declined to give detailed comment on the rare stalemate over design principles. \"As we work through the rigorous development, we continue to engage with the FAA and global regulators to ensure we meet their expectations and all applicable requirements,\" a Boeing spokesperson said. EASA said it is cooperating with the FAA and noted that its job is not to dictate specific technical solutions. \"We are looking closely at the technical files with the FAA and Boeing and this work is still ongoing in an atmosphere of complete transparency and full cooperation,\" a spokesperson said. The FAA said it would \"not approve any aircraft unless it meets our safety and certification standards.\" The financial impact of the dispute remains unclear. A year ago, Boeing announced a $6.5 billion charge for certification delays and weaker-than-expected demand and pushed back 777X entry into service to late 2023. The design philosophy backed by EASA would delay this further, the people said. In South Carolina, meanwhile, mechanics are combing through parked 787s with ultrasound devices and tools to measure gaps barely visible to the naked eye - an undertaking that makes full resumption of deliveries unlikely before April, the people said. The gaps - left in the process for making carbon-composite structures that make the jet lighter and cheaper to fly - are the width of a human hair but violate Boeing's specifications. Boeing says the 787's problems stem from specifications that incorporate a high safety margin and that it reported the issue itself. Still, it depends on FAA approval to restore deliveries. Boeing delivered 14 in 2021 compared with 41 in 2020. Now, a key question is whether the FAA will accept Boeing's assertion - backed by new analysis of composites and structural tolerances - that its initial specifications of the gaps can be tweaked without risking safety, two of the people said. \"The issues that our engineers identified and are addressing are part of our methodical approach to ensure conformance to our exacting specifications,\" the Boeing spokesperson said. Boeing said in October inspections and repairs due to the structural compliance problems would be roughly $1 billion. But factory changes and other requirements to overcome tiny structural blemishes have raised longer-term questions over Boeing's ability to build 787s at a sufficiently low cost and at the rates once planned, a person familiar with the matter said. Boeing may be able to make up ground by wringing out inefficiencies in manufacturing. And a recent decision to focus production in one state will reduce fixed costs. For now, scrutiny remains intense. When it comes to small gaps in the structure surrounding the passenger and cargo doors in the aft fuselage, for example, the FAA has required painstaking manual checks of some 100 aircraft. That is instead of allowing Boeing to test only a sample of planes. \"For decades, that was an acceptable way of saying the fleet is good,\" the senior safety expert said. \"Having to inspect every single airplane is technically, from a safety perspective, unnecessary. But in this climate it is required.\"",

The FAA said the settlement separately covers the planemaker's submission of 178 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft for airworthiness certification when the aircraft potentially had non-conforming slat tracks installed, and improperly marked those slat tracks. Boeing has agreed to a number of corrective actions, including conducting safety risk-management analyses to determine \"whether its supply-chain oversight processes are appropriate and whether the company is ready to safely increase the Boeing 737 production rate,\" the agency said. The company must strengthen procedures to ensure it does not install any aircraft parts that fail to conform to their approved design, the FAA said. \"Keeping the flying public safe is our primary responsibility. That is not negotiable, and the FAA will hold Boeing and the aviation industry accountable to keep our skies safe,\" FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said.

We continue to devote time and resources to improving safety and quality performance across our operations.\" If Boeing does not complete corrective actions in a timely fashion, the FAA can levy up to $10.1 million in additional penalties. Boeing must also revise production procedures to enable the FAA \"to observe production rate readiness assessments, (and) the data on which the company bases the assessments, and the results of the assessments.\" In March 2020, the FAA proposed fining Boeing Co $19.7 million for allegedly installing equipment on hundreds of 737 aircraft containing sensors in heads-up displays that regulators had not approved for use.

Nichols, who died on July 30 at age 89, is credited with helping shatter racial stereotypes and redefining Hollywood roles for Black actors at the height of the U.S. Civil Rights movement, as one of the first Black women to portray an empowered character on network television. Now she has been added to the posthumous passenger manifest of a real-life rocketship due to carry a collection of vials containing cremated ashes and DNA samples from dozens of departed space enthusiasts on a final, and eternal voyage around the sun, according to organizers of the tribute. A date for the launch has not yet been set. Other “Star Trek” cast members and executives who have had remains launched into space include James Doohan, who played the show’s chief engineer Scotty, and “Star Trek” creator Gene Roddenberrry. Also joining the launch will be the remains of Roddenberry’s wife, Majel Barrett-Roddenberry, who played nurse Christine Chapel on the series, and the renowned sci-fi visual effects artist Douglas Trumbull, whose work was featured in such films as “2001: A Space Odyssey” and “Star Trek: The Motion Picture.” The launch is organized by Celestis Inc, a Texas-based company that has created a unique niche in the burgeoning commercial space sector by offering a measure of cosmic immortality to customers that can afford a dramatic send-off, which contracts with private rocket ventures. Celestis has not divulged the fees for this flight but lists the pricing for its memorial spaceflightsNew Tab on its website. The upcoming memorial flight will be aboard a Vulcan Centaur rocket, still under development by the Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA). Plans call for the 200-plus capsules carrying human remains and DNA for what Celestis is calling its “Enterprise Flight” to go inside the upper rocket stage that will fly on into deep space, beyond the gravitational pull of the Earth and moon and eventually enter a perpetual solar orbit, said Charles Chafer, co-founder and chief executive officer of Celestis. “It's a wonderful memorial for her, an eternal one,” Nichols' son Kyle Johnson, told Reuters. In the 1970s, Nichols was hired by NASA to help recruit more marginalized groups and women to the space agency, where she was influential in attracting such talent as the first woman U.S. astronaut, Sally Ride, the first Black woman astronaut, Mae Jemison, and the first Black NASA chief, Charlie Bolden.",

The model has only one known export customer, Pakistan, and no sales have been announced so far at the air show, where the trade portion ends on Friday. \"The Z-10 may appeal to some of those countries that don't have access to U.S. defence technology,\" said Douglas Barrie of the International Institute of Strategic Studies. \"After-sales logistics and maintenance support would be a challenge, given Beijing's relative inexperience in this area.\" AVIC representatives at the air show declined to comment. The helicopter, which has a chin-mounted chain gun and was displayed alongside several types of compatible missiles and rockets, sat not far from a Boeing (BA.N)New Tab AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, operated by the Singaporean military and those of many other U.S. allies. Experts said it was not likely to compete with the Apache, or many of the rotary-wing offerings at the air show, including those of Bell Helicopters, Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and others. \"The performance and capabilities of this platform would certainly make it of interest for export,\" said Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. \"A key capability gap would be a manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) type capability to allow the Z-10 crew to control UAVs and loitering munitions. ... The experience being gained in Ukraine suggests that attack helicopter and armed reconnaissance helicopter operations over a future battlespace will depend increasingly on a MUM-T capability.\" The performance and capabilities of the Z-10 have not been made public, but Chinese state media outlet Global Times reported it had \"outstanding flight performance, low-air maneuverability, firepower, survivability, ergonomics and reliability\". A representative of a European defence company said possible customers for the Z-10 could include Myanmar and countries in Southeast Asia that already use other Chinese-made equipment. Davis agreed, noting that U.S. export restrictions could also affect purchasing decisions. Airbus said this week that it expected countries in the Asia-Pacific region to add 1,500 military helicopters of all types over the next decade. \"I imagine likely purchaser candidates would be states on friendly relations with Beijing - Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, and perhaps Malaysia - but do they have a requirement for this sort of capability?\" Davis said.",

The crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia led to a 20-month grounding for the best-selling plane, costing Boeing more than $20 billion and prompting lawmakers to pass sweeping legislation reforming airplane certification. Boeing declined comment. The report FAA officials \"expressed frustration that foreign civil aviation authorities were grounding the aircraft before they had data that linked the two accidents.\" The report said FAA has not updated the underlying order and related guidance for its post-event risk assessment processes in over a decade and lacks \"quantifiable human factors data, such as pilot reactions to non-normal situations.\" It also said FAA engineers \"are not all following or receiving the same guidance or training.\" It made seven recommendations for improvements for risk assessments and other issues. The FAA said it agrees with the Inspector General's recommendations. \"We also continue to look for additional opportunities to apply lessons learned from the Boeing 737 MAX's return to service,\" the agency said Friday. The report also says following the Ethiopian Airlines crash an FAA engineer drafted a preliminary risk analysis for the MAX on March 12, 2019 that \"showed a fleet risk for the MAX that was over 13 times\" the agency's recommended guidelines. \"An FAA official noted at the time that the analysis suggested that there was a 25% chance of an accident in 60 days and that there were only 'a matter of days' to implement a fix.\" The inspector general added the engineer's risk analysis was not completed and did not go through managerial review citing a lack of detailed flight data.",

            "text": "A luxurious superyacht belonging to a sanctioned Russian billionaire parliamentarian featuring six suites, an elevator, its own beach club and a helicopter pad is anchored in Dubai where Russians have sheltered wealth since the invasion of Ukraine. Andrei Skoch's blue and white \"Madame Gu\" was docked at Port Rashid on Friday, where Dubai's Ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum keeps his own yacht, both visible to passersby. Dubai has emerged as a refuge for Russian wealth as Western sanctions target President Vladimir Putin's allies. The United Arab Emirates, seeking to maintain what it says is a neutral position on the war, has not imposed sanctions. That has frustrated many Western diplomats who privately say the UAE position is untenable and siding with Moscow. On Wednesday, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf was asked during a U.S. House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee hearing about reports of Putin-linked oligarchs and businessmen sheltering assets in the UAE. \"I’m not happy at all with the record at this point and I plan to make this a priority to drive to a better alignment, shall we say, of effort,\" she said. Skoch, 56, was sanctioned this year by the West, including the European Union, over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The United States had sanctioned the State Duma member in 2018. The Madame Gu superyacht has been anchored in the Dubai port since March 6, according to Refinitiv data, and arrived in the UAE last November, several months before Ukraine was invaded. UAE officials and the U.S. and British embassies in Abu Dhabi did not immediately respond to questions on the vessel. Neither did a representative for the EU mission in the UAE. Britain's trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, speaking during an interview with Reuters in the UAE on Thursday, urged more nations to punish Russia. Asked if there were concerns about Russians evading sanctions through the UAE, Trevelyan said imposing sanctions is a sovereign decision, without addressing whether there was unease. A Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 787 Dreamliner owned by sanctioned oligarch Roman Abramovich arrived in Dubai in March, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. A U.S. court has ordered its seizure.",

            "text": "Airplane maker Boeing (BA.N)New Tab is urging airlines to inspect 737 MAX airplanes for a possible loose bolt in the rudder control system, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Thursday. The FAA said it was closely monitoring Boeing 737 MAX targeted inspections and will consider additional action based on any further discovery of loose or missing hardware. Boeing recommended inspections after an international operator discovered a bolt with a missing nut while performing routine maintenance on a mechanism in the rudder-control linkage, the FAA said. Boeing discovered an additional undelivered aircraft with a nut not properly tightened, the agency said. \"The issue identified on the particular airplane has been remedied,\" Boeing said. \"Out of an abundance of caution, we are recommending operators inspect their 737 MAX airplanes and inform us of any findings. We informed the FAA and our customers and will continue to keep them aware of the progress.\" The planemaker has recommended that airlines inspect their MAXs within two weeks, but delivered 737 MAX planes can continue to fly safely, Boeing said. Production and delivery of the MAX will continue. The issue does not affect older-model 737 Next Generation planes, Boeing said. Boeing shares were down 1% in midday trade. United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab American Airlines (AAL.O)New Tab , two major domestic customers of the MAX, each said it did not expect inspections to have an impact on operations. Southwest Airlines (LUV.N)New Tab , a U.S. carrier that solely flies the 737 NG and MAX, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FAA said Boeing had issued a message urging operators of newer single-aisle airplanes to inspect specific tie rods that control rudder movement for possible loose hardware. The rudder controls the position of an aircraft's nose while in flight. The inspections involve taking off an access panel and validating that the hardware had been properly installed, Boeing said. The process should take two hours, and Boeing is inspecting undelivered 737 MAX aircraft before handing them over to customers. \"The FAA will remain in contact with Boeing and the airlines while the inspections are under way,\" the agency said, asking airlines to answer if any loose hardware has been detected previously and provide details on how quickly these inspections can be completed. Any issue involving a rudder that is not working properly would likely be identified in a pre-flight check, as flight crews routinely examine the rudder system before an aircraft pushes back from the gate, Boeing said. The inspections will help the FAA determine how prevalent the problem is and whether it is a sign of a larger lapse in production quality that requires the regulator to take further action, said Anthony Brickhouse, an air safety expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. \"Airlines need to take it seriously,\" he said. \"But as a member of the flying public, I don't see this as an issue to be concerned about.\" The 737 MAX was grounded for 20 months worldwide after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia. Boeing is still awaiting certification of its smaller 737 MAX 7 and larger MAX 10. The FAA has carefully scrutinized the MAX. The FAA in 2021 said it was tracking all 737 MAX airplanes using satellite data.",

The Army's \"Future Vertical Lift\" competition aimed at finding a replacement as the Army looks to retire more than 2,000 medium-class UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters built by Sikorsky since the 1970s. The Army was looking for an aircraft capable of moving about a dozen troops 400 nautical miles. \"We are ready to equip soldiers with the speed and range they need to compete and win using the most mature, reliable, and affordable high-performance long-range assault weapon system,\" Mitch Snyder, CEO of Bell said in a statement. The Army said the initial award was for $232 million, but the first batch of helicopters in low rate production will be worth $7.1 billion. Ultimately, the contract is potentially worth around $70 billion - over decades - depending on how many the Army and U.S. allies order, the Army told reporters on Monday evening. \"The thoughtful and disciplined execution of the FLRAA (Future Long Range Assault Aircraft) program strategy will deliver the transformational capabilities we need to support the Joint force, strengthen deterrence and win in multi-domain operations,\" said Doug Bush, assistant secretary of the army for acquisition, logistics, and technology. In the FLARAA competition was Bell's V-280 \"Valor,\" a tiltrotor aircraft that has reached speeds in excess of 340 mph (547 km) according to the Army.

But he said he believed the production issues would resolve in the medium term and said the Irish airline, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, was in talks with Boeing about a significant order of the larger, 230-seat, MAX 10 aircraft. The largest European customer of the MAX with 210 firm orders of the 197-seat MAX200 model, Ryanair in late March said it expected that before summer it would take delivery of 16 of the aircraft, down from an earlier forecast of 40. But Boeing is now promising the first delivery of the jet, which has been delayed in part due to a recent electrical grounding issue, in late May. \"We are now being told the first delivery will be in late May. I am not sure we necessarily believe that,\" O'Leary said in a pre-recorded presentation following the release of the company's full-year results. \"As the management team in Seattle continues to mismanage that process I think there is a real risk we might not see any of these aircraft in advance of summer 2021,\" O'Leary said. Ryanair was initially due to take delivery of its first MAX two years ago before the jet was grounded for 20 months after two fatal crashes. The airline has agreed \"reasonable and fair\" compensation for that delay, it said in its results statement on Monday. Ryanair is confident it will have 60 of the aircraft in place for the summer of 2022, he said. Ryanair remains in talks with Boeing for a significant order of the larger MAX 10 aircraft, but \"we are not quite there on price yet,\" Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan said in an interview. Asked how big such a deal would be, Sorahan said it would cover both fleet renewal and growth in the 2026 to 2030 period. \"We don't tend to do small deals,\" he said.",

            "text": "(This Nov. 29 story has been corrected after a clarification from the the Yakushima Fisheries Cooperative that one person had been found, not three, in paragraph 5) A U.S. military aircraft carrying eight people crashed into the sea in Japan on Wednesday, killing at least one crew member. The U.S. military said the mishap occurred during a routine training mission off the shores of Yakushima Island, about 1,040 km (650 miles) southwest of the capital Tokyo. \"The crew’s conditions are unknown at this time,\" a statement from U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command said. Japan's coast guard said what appeared to be wreckage from the tilt-rotor V-22 Osprey and one person, who was later confirmed to have died, were found about 3 km (2 miles) from the shore. A representative for the Yakushima Fisheries Cooperative initially said fishing boats in the area found three people in the surrounding waters, but later clarified that just one person had been found. Another Osprey thought to have been travelling with the crashed aircraft landed safely at the island's airport on Wednesday afternoon, a spokesperson for the local government said. The United States has more than 50,000 U.S. troops in Japan, many in the strategically important southwestern Okinawan islands, amid growing Chinese military assertiveness around nearby Taiwan. The crash happened just before 3 p.m. (0600 GMT), with witnesses saying the aircraft's left engine appeared to be on fire as it approached an airport for an emergency landing, despite clear weather and light wind, media reported. The aircraft was part of a unit based in Okinawa trained to transport and supply special operations forces, according to the U.S. military. Japan, which also operates Osprey aircraft, said on Wednesday it had asked the U.S. military to investigate the crash. Developed jointly by Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and Bell Helicopter, the Osprey can fly both like a helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft and is operated by the U.S. Air Force, Marines and Navy and the Japan Self-Defense Forces. The deployment of the hybrid aircraft in Japan has been controversial, with critics saying it is prone to accidents. The U.S. military and Japan say it is safe. In August, a U.S. Osprey crashed off the coast of northern Australia while transporting troops during a routine military exercise, killing three U.S. Marines. Another crash-landed in the ocean off Japan's southern island of Okinawa in December 2016, prompting a temporary U.S. military grounding of the aircraft.",

            "text": "Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab sought a compromise to try to unblock dozens of A350 orders from Dubai's Emirates late on Wednesday, buoyed by a deal for 11 of the most popular version of the jet with Ethiopian Airlines, industry sources said. Dubai Airshow talks to rescue a delayed order for long-haul jets, potentially switching to the A350-900 version, looked set to drag into Thursday amid the fallout from a clash with Rolls-Royce (RR.L)New Tab over engine performance on the larger A350-1000. Emirates and its suppliers had no immediate comment. The sources said there was no guarantee of a deal before the show ends on Friday. Backroom engine negotiations that are often said to drive big-ticket airplane orders at the industry's marquee events have been grabbing headlines this week, after a public spat between the Dubai carrier and Rolls-Royce. Emirates Airline President Tim Clark warned Airbus and Rolls-Royce on Tuesday that increased engine downtime in harsh Gulf conditions - as well as higher prices for servicing - stood in the way of an order for between 35 and 50 A350-1000 jets. Rolls-Royce said it was taking steps to improve durability of Trent XWB-97 jet engines that power the A350-1000, but rejected Clark's suggestion that the engines were \"defective\". As buggies shuttled executives between Rolls-Royce, Airbus and Emirates chalets in fading light on Wednesday, sources said differences were narrowing. One said the parties were \"close\" but not enough to pull off a turnaround on Wednesday. One possible compromise, they said, could involve Emirates making a further purchase of A350-900s while Rolls-Royce studies ways of improving engine durability on the larger A350-1000. Clark on Tuesday described the A350-900, the most widely sold version of the long-haul family, as a \"very good airplane\". Emirates has already ordered 50 A350-900s, the first of which is due to arrive in mid-2024. Airbus won a top-up order for 11 of the same model from Ethiopian Airlines on Wednesday after a delay that delegates also linked to engine pricing talks with Rolls-Royce. Engines have become a pressing topic as airlines juggle fuel savings from the latest engines against the rising cost of keeping them maintained and flying over 20 years of service. Airlines are increasingly buying jets at the same time as negotiating complex engine maintenance deals that sit less comfortably with the traditional quick-fire of air show announcements. Emirates and Airbus had been close to finalising a deal on Tuesday but it later fell apart, sources said, without saying why agreement could not be reached at that stage. \"One minute it's on, then it's off,\" one delegate said. UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Wednesday visited the show, where he was seen briefly meeting executives from Lockheed Martin (LMT.N)New Tab and Saab (SAABb.ST)New Tab . An Emirates A350 order would help rebalance the show after Boeing and engine maker GE dominated the opening with a $50 billion order including 90 777X jets on Monday. However it is not in the same category as the larger 400-seat 777X. One industry source cautioned that a fallback A350-900 order risked sending a signal that Airbus did not have an effective 777X competitor in all climates, since the A350-1000 is widely seen as underpowered for harsh Gulf conditions. Rolls said on Tuesday it was operating well in more moderate conditions away from the heat and sand ingestion of the Gulf. Sources said previous hiccups in air show negotiations over deals such as an Emirates purchase of Airbus A380s in 2017 needed months of further detailed talks. The A350-900 uses a different variant of engine from the A350-1000 and has not faced simliar criticism over durability. Boeing has won the majority of order announcements this week. Emirates on Monday placed a $52 billion order for 90 new 777X and five additional 787s, while sister airline flyDubai placed its first ever wide-body order for 30 787s. Ethiopian Airlines ordered 20 737 MAX jets, nearly five years after the fatal 2019 MAX aircraft crash that led to the grounding of the global fleet. It also ordered 11 Dreamliners. Airbus secured an ordered for 10 A350-900s from EgyptAir, while AirBaltic said it was buying 30 A220-300 jets. Emirates Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum hinted at the path to an agreement with Rolls-Royce. \"When we feel that we have a good deal, we will sign,\" he said, Abu Dhabi-based newspaper The National reported. \"I need guarantees on when, at what price and the maintenance cost per hour. That would solve it,\" he added.",

            "text": "Six people were dead after two vintage military planes collided midair on Saturday and crashed in flames before a crowd of thousands who came to see them fly at a World War Two commemorative air show in Dallas, officials said on Sunday. No one in the crowd of 4,000 onlookers was hurt, and no names of the victims were released. \"Authorities will continue working today on the investigation & identification of the deceased,\" said Judge Clay Jenkins, the chief elected official in the Texas county. \"Please pray for their families and all involved.\" The crash involved World War Two-era planes - a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber and a Bell P-63 Kingcobra fighter - that were flying at the Wings Over Dallas Airshow at Dallas Executive Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement. Hank Coates, the president and CEO of the Commemorative Air Force, a group dedicated to the preservation of World War Two combat aircraft, said the B-17, a massive four-engine bomber, normally has a crew of four to five people. The P-63 is a U.S. fighter plane manned by a single pilot, Coates added, but he would not say how many people were aboard the aircraft at the time of the crash. Leah Block, the spokesperson for the Commemorative Air Force, which is dedicated to preserving World War Two aircraft and hosts the air show, said told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that they are not sure why the accident occurred. Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) started an investigation on Sunday. Video clips posted on social media showed the two aircraft colliding and crashing on the ground, engulfed by a fireball and a cloud of black smoke as a scattered cloud of shrapnel from the craft fell to a patch of scorched earth. Previous fatal air show disasters have happened from both pilot and mechanical failures. Eleven people were killed and 74 people injured in Reno, Nevada in 2011 air show when a P-51 Mustang crashed into onlookers, due to mechanical failure, the NTSB found. In 2019, a B-17 bomber crashed in Hartford, Connecticut, killing seven people due to pilot error and inadequate maintenance, the agency also found.",

            "text": "Plans by Airbus to host its largest investor meeting in three years have been postponed after the keenly awaited presentation clashed with Queen Elizabeth's jubilee, ruffling feathers among the aerospace giant's British investors and staff. Airbus officials have written to participants acknowledging the date for the Capital Market Days was \"inconvenient\" and set a new date of Sept. 22-23, according to an email seen by Reuters. The original date of June 2-3 overlapped with two public holidays at the start of celebrations to mark Queen Elizabeth's seven decades on the throne and raised eyebrows in Britain, where 14,000 employees build the wings for Airbus jets. The company is the biggest supplier of large aircraft to the Royal Air Force, which plans to hold a jubilee fly-past likely to include Airbus transporters on June 2. read more The plan had also upset UK analysts forced to abandon family holiday weekends to travel to France for the event. \"The Brits were revolting,\" quipped Vertical Research analyst Rob Stallard. The company was eventually forced to rethink the idea after airlines extended summer schedule cuts to June, in a reminder of the incomplete recovery seen in the planemaker's core markets. Airbus, which marked its own 50-year anniversary three years ago, was born as a consortium of national assets in Britain, France, Germany and Spain. But analysts say its UK role has been increasingly marginalised since Britain left the European Union. A company spokesperson declined to comment on meeting agendas. The Capital Markets Day is expected to set the tone for months as Airbus aims to defend a strong lead over rival Boeing (BA.N)New Tab . Multiple aerospace firms are holding such events to kickstart interest in the sector after the two-year pandemic. Airbus' timing headache is not entirely over. Also competing for attention will be Boeing, which is expected to organise its own investor summit in September, analysts said.",

            "text": "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Wednesday that it would open an investigation into a Jan. 23 incident at Honolulu Airport involving a United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab widebody crossing a runway and conflicting with a Cessna landing on the same runway. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which is also investigating, said an air traffic controller told the United Boeing 777 to stop on a taxiway before reaching the runway, but the United flight crossed it as the Cessna 208B cargo plane was landing. The Cessna came to a stop about 1,170 feet from where the United jet was crossing, the FAA said. No damage or injuries were reported. United referred questions about the incident to the NTSB. Acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen said a spate of recent airline incidents have prompted him to order a safety team review and hold a safety summit next month. NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said last week in an interview that the board has opened investigations into 18 runway incursion incidents since 2013, including two from last summer that remain under investigation. Last week, Homendy said a FedEx (FDX.N)New Tab Boeing 767 cargo plane and a Southwest Airlines 737-700 that nearly collided on Feb. 4 in Austin, Texas were \"probably under 100 feet (30.5 meters) vertically from each other.\" The FedEx plane had been set to land on a runway on which a Southwest Airlines (LUV.N)New Tab jet was also cleared to depart. Homendy said it could have resulted in \"terrible tragedy.\" Homendy said it was too early to say if there was any trend among the recent runway incursion incidents but she noted \"it just takes one\" to have a devastating tragedy. Homendy said another runway incursion last month at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport in which a Delta Air Lines (DAL.N)New Tab plane came to a safe stop after air traffic controllers noticed an American Airlines (AAL.O)New Tab Boeing 777 had crossed from an adjacent taxiway could also have been tragic. On Friday, the NTSB issued subpoenas to the American Airlines flight crew after they refused to be interviewed on the basis their statements would be recorded for transcription. A spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association union said on Wednesday that the \"pilots intend to appear for their interviews in accordance with the subpoenas.\" The NTSB on Tuesday said it would investigate a Dec. 18 incident in which another United 777 lost altitude and came within about 800 feet of the Pacific Ocean before recovering shortly after departing Kahului, Hawaii.",

            "text": "Small, cheap, deadly drones caught the attention of military planners in 2020 when used to devastating effect in the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, but political sensitivities may keep them out of Southeast Asia, a regional defence expert said. Some armed models were among the drones on display at the Singapore Airshow this week, though none matched the precise features of the so-called \"loitering munitions\" used in the fighting two years ago - flying quietly overhead until diving down to destroy a target. Yet many regional governments are interested in that capability, said Collin Koh, a research fellow at Singapore's Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies. \"Killer drones were well emphasized during that conflict... and there is certainly growing interest,\" Koh said. \"Some even argued that killer drones are a gamechanger to the future of conflict. All these lessons are being paid attention to in the region.\" However, he said, with relative stability prevailing, acquiring such an offensive capability might alarm one's neighbours. \"Some countries might just see it as an additional expense ... or see acquiring such a system as provocative,\" he said. Last year, Israel Aerospace Industries (ISRAI.UL) (IAI) said it had sold its Harop loitering munition, used in the 2020 fighting, to two unnamed Asian customers. Such a deal would typically fall in the range of about $100 million for many drones, compared with roughly $90 million for a single F-35 combat aircraft. Lockheed Martin (LMT.N)New Tab is involved with producing the MORFIUS drone, a small, reusable autonomous aircraft designed to electronically disrupt or destroy swarms of enemy drones. The system is not planned for international sale, however, said Tim Cahill, Lockheed Martin's senior vice president for global business. \"It will go out ... and go past an unmanned aerial vehicle that is flying at you and take it out,\" he said. In general, there is high interest in unmanned systems in Asia and Southeast Asia for different roles, he said, including patrols of oceans, borders and coastlines. Elbit Systems (ESLT.TA)New Tab , an Israeli company, displayed a small, long-endurance drone that uses both an electric and a conventional fuel-powered motor. Boeing (BA.N)New Tab separately touted its Loyal Wingman drone, meant to fly alongside and support a crewed fighter, which it is developing in Australia, as well as its MQ-25 uncrewed tanker aircraft. Although no major drone deals were announced at the show, as countries recover slowly from the economic woes brought by COVID-19, some of their military spending will surely go toward unmanned systems, Koh said. \"Drones are an evergreen area to look at,\" he said. \"Armed drones, and drones that are optimised for maritime surveillance.\"",

Pekoske was nominated by former President Donald Trump in 2017 to a five-year term and nominated by President Joe Biden in May to serve a new term. The TSA, created by Congress in November 2001 after the Sept. 11 attacks, is responsible for security operations at 430 U.S. airports and is the lead federal agency for security of highways, railroads, mass transit systems and pipelines. In July, Biden nominated Denver International Airport Chief Executive Phil Washington, a former Biden Transportation Department transition official to head the FAA.

The next FAA administrator will face questions about the agency's oversight of planemaker Boeing (BA.N)New Tab . Senator Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Commerce Committee, had earlier expressed \"skepticism\" about Washington due to his \"lack of experience in aviation.\" \"Now I am deeply troubled to learn the nominee was named in a search warrant that ties him to allegations of corruption at LA Metro,\" he said on Wednesday. Washington, a former CEO of the Los Angeles public transport system, told Bloomberg News on Thursday \"all the allegations are false.\" Senator Maria Cantwell, the Commerce Committee chair said on Thursday in a statement all nominees were subject to the confirmation process that includes \"a careful and thorough review of the individual’s qualifications.

The FAA said Friday it was satisfied the issue has been resolved and approved Boeing to resume delivering 787s. Boeing is expected to deliver another 787 to American Airlines (AAL.O)New Tab shortly, sources said.

Between the Saudi deal and separate orders from United Airlines and Air India, Boeing has received orders for almost 200 Dreamliners over the past four months. The company must now drive down the risk of supply chain constraints as it seeks to ramp up 787 production from its current low rate to its target of 10 a month by the end of 2026, analysts said.

In February 2023, a FedEx (FDX.N)New Tab cargo plane and a Southwest Airlines (LUV.N)New Tab Boeing 737 that came within about 115 feet (35 meters) of each other in Austin in poor visibility conditions could have been a \"terrible tragedy,\" Homendy said last year.

            "text": "The U.S. State Department has approved a potential $1.1 billion sale of military equipment to Taiwan, including 60 anti-ship missiles and 100 air-to-air missiles, with China threatening to take counter measures. The Pentagon announced the package on Friday in the wake of China's aggressive military drills around Taiwan following a visit to the island last month by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking U.S. official to travel to Taipei in years. read more The sale includes Sidewinder missiles, which can be used for air-to-air and surface-attack missions, at a cost of some $85.6 million, Harpoon anti-ship missiles at an estimated $355 million cost and support for Taiwan's surveillance radar program for an estimated $665.4 million, the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said. Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in a statement the possible arms sale \"severely jeopardizes China-U.S. relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\" \"China will resolutely take legitimate and necessary counter-measures in light of the development of the situation,\" he said. President Joe Biden's administration said the package has been under consideration for some time and was developed in consultation with Taiwan and U.S. lawmakers. \"As the PRC continues to increase pressure on Taiwan – including through heightened military air and maritime presence around Taiwan – and engages in attempts to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, we’re providing Taiwan with what it needs to maintain its self-defense capabilities,\" Laura Rosenberger, White House senior director for China and Taiwan, said in a statement. Reuters reported last month that the Biden administration was planning new equipment for Taiwan but that the equipment would sustain Taiwan's current military systems and fulfill existing orders, not offer new capabilities, despite the heightened tensions that followed Pelosi's visit. read more The Pentagon said the equipment and support announced on Friday would not alter the basic military balance in the region. U.S. officials said they did not reflect any change in policy toward Taiwan. \"These proposed sales are routine cases to support Taiwan’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,\" a U.S. Department of State spokesperson said, requesting anonymity. Taiwan's defense ministry expressed its thanks, adding that China's recent \"provocative\" activities represented a serious threat and the arms sale would help it face China's military pressure. \"At the same time, it also demonstrates that it will help our country strengthen its overall defense capabilities and jointly maintain the security and peace of the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific region,\" the ministry said in a statement. Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, said his organization opposed what he termed a \"limited approach\" to arms sales to Taiwan. \"As the (China's) People’s Liberation Army (PLA) recently demonstrated in its mock blockade, the island faces a range of threats that require a range of capabilities. To deny the island the ability to mount a full defense will, over time, create new gaps in Taiwan’s defenses that the PLA can exploit,\" Hammond-Chambers said in a statement. The order reflects continued U.S. support for Taiwan as Taipei faces pressure from China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory and has never ruled out using force to bring the democratically ruled island under its control. The sales must be reviewed by Congress, but both Democratic and Republican congressional aides said they do not expect opposition. There have been at least two other visits to Taiwan by members of Congress from both parties since Pelosi's visit, as well as by governors of U.S. states, all condemned by Beijing. read more The principal contractor for the Harpoon missiles is Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab . Raytheon (RTX.N)New Tab is the principal contractor for both the Sidewinders and the radar program. Taipei says that as the People's Republic of China has never ruled the island, it has no right to claim it.",

A group of business groups representing retail, wholesale, warehousing, transportation, travel and logistics filed one of the first petitions with the high court, raising among other issues the potential for workers to quit rather than take the shot. \"The resulting labor upheaval will devastate already fragile supply chains and labor markets at the peak holiday season,\" said the petition.

            "title": "After confidential witness recants, judge in Chemours class action wants answers",
            "text": "Shareholder lawyers who filed a securities fraud class action against The Chemours Co — but then decided to drop the case when a confidential witness recanted his allegations — are going to have to do some explaining about who is responsible for the collapse of the class action. U.S. District Judge Colm Connolly of Wilmington last week orderedNew Tab lawyers from Saxena White and Prickett, Jones & Elliott to file the transcript of an April deposition of the witness, a former high-ranking Chemours executive, on June 3. Connolly also set an Aug. 2 hearing date to determine whether shareholder lawyers complied with Rule 11, which requires filings to be made in good faith.(When Congress enacted legislation in 1995 to discourage unwarranted securities class actions, lawmakers included a provision that specifically requires judges to ascertain compliance with Rule 11 when courts dispose of the cases. But, in practice, the provision is rarely invoked.) Connolly entered the order signaling his concerns about the recanting witness after plaintiffs lawyers and Chemours counsel from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Friedlander & Gorris filed a stipulation and joint motionNew Tab to dismiss the class action, which alleged that Chemours, a 2015 spinoff from The Dupont Co, deceived investors for more than two years about its liability for remediation of contaminated environmental sites. In the joint filing, the two sides said they agreed that neither had violated Rule 11. Saxena White declined to provide a statement on Connolly's Rule 11 hearing order. Chemours counsel Jonathan Moses of Wachtell did not respond to my email. Allegations from confidential witnesses, as you know, are often a critical component of shareholders’ securities fraud class action complaints. Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, shareholders cannot obtain discovery from defendants until they’ve survived a motion to dismiss. Instead, plaintiffs lawyers routinely hire investigators to sniff out corporate insiders — typically, former or disaffected employees — whose information can bolster the fraud claims in their initial pleadings. Defendants, of course, don’t look kindly on allegations premised on information from confidential witnesses, so it’s common for disputes to arise over both the truthfulness of the informants and the conduct of plaintiffs lawyers (and their investigators) in obtaining and recounting informants' evidence. In one of the best-known examples, The Boeing Co accused Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd in 2010 of including obviously erroneous allegations from a purported Boeing engineer in a shareholder fraud complaint alleging misrepresentations about the production of Dreamliner jets. Among other problems with the witness: He was never actually employed by Boeing. In 2014, after a remandNew Tab from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, U.S. District Judge Ruben Castillo of Chicago concludedNew Tab that Robbins Geller had failed to conduct an adequate investigation of the witness’ allegations before including them in its complaint. But in other cases, as I’ve reportedNew Tab , corporate insiders who willingly provided valuable information to shareholder lawyers recanted their accounts when they realized the consequences of that cooperation. Plaintiffs lawyers will tell you, in fact, that corporations and their defense lawyers use intimidation tactics — like threatening to rescind severance agreements — to get confidential witnesses to change their stories. Back in 2012, for instance, Robbins Geller alleged that after Lockheed Martin Corp learned the identity of shareholders' confidential witnesses through discovery, the company bullied the witnesses into recanting. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff of Manhattan held an evidentiary hearing at which he entertained testimony from several recanting witnesses and from Robbins Geller’s investigator. The judge foundNew Tab , on balance, that the investigator was far more credible than the former Lockheed employees. He denied summary judgment to Lockheed, bemoaning “endemic” controversies in securities litigation over the credibility of confidential witnesses. We don’t yet have enough information to know whether the confidential witness in the Chemours case — a onetime division president named Paul Kirsch, who allegedly presented a report on environmental remediation liability to the Chemours board in 2018 — recanted under pressure, was misrepresented in shareholders’ complaint or changed his tune for some other reason. The transcript of his deposition, which was conducted in April and is due to be filed with Connolly next week, should clear up a lot of the mystery.(Kirsch was easily identified because plaintiffs lawyers cited his corporate title in their complaint.) What we do know is that allegations involving Kirsh’s report to the board were only a small piece of the fraud case that plaintiffs initially alleged. Their complaint instead centered on the allegation that Chemours revealed its crippling liability for environmental cleanup costs when the company filed a lawsuit against its parent Dupont in Delaware Chancery Court in 2019. Chemours’ Chancery Court complaint, according to plaintiffs, showed that the company knew it was insolvent at the time of the 2015 spinoff but told investors otherwise for years afterward. In their motion to dismissNew Tab the class action, defense lawyers said Kirsch disputed shareholders’ depiction of his 2018 report to the board. In an accompanying two-page declaration, Kirsch said the complaint was “misleading,” and that his report to the board “was in no way an estimate of Chemours’ current remediation obligations,” but was instead a long-range projection of how much it would cost the company to meet ambitious environmental goals. Kirsch’s report became the centerpiece of the case after Connolly threw outNew Tab plaintiffs’ other claims in February. The judge acknowledged in that opinion that Chemours disputed the complaint's depiction of Kirsch’s presentation to the board. He said, however, that Kirsch’s apparent recantation would be more appropriately considered in a Rule 11 or summary judgment motion. The judge did suggest in February that the two sides depose Kirsch before launching into discovery. After that deposition, shareholder lawyers agreed that the Kirsch allegations should be stricken from their complaint, according to their May 16 joint filing with defendants. Without those allegations, the stipulation said, shareholders had no live claims. As I mentioned, Chemours and its lawyers aren’t asserting misconduct by plaintiffs counsel. Now shareholder lawyers just have to convince the judge they didn’t do anything wrong.

It builds momentum for planemakers seeking to turn the page on the COVID-19 travel slump, at least in the United States, and signals a strong bet on a recovery in business travel. Chief Executive Scott Kirby said it would \"accelerate our business to meet a resurgence in air travel.\" America's third-largest airline by revenue will replace most of its regional jets and undertake a sweeping cabin overhaul with more premium seats. \"With a number of startups commencing operations or with plans to, United is putting the U.S. travel industry on notice,\" said Peter McNally, analyst at research firm Third Bridge. The order, confirming a detailed breakdown reported by Reuters on Monday, includes 50 Boeing 737 MAX 8 and 150 MAX 10, accelerating a recovery in the wake of a two-year MAX safety crisis in what market sources called a partial coup for Boeing. It especially marks a breakthrough for the 230-seat MAX 10, the largest variant which has begun flight tests but until now has struggled to contain runaway sales of the competing A321neo. But Boeing's victory over Airbus in the number of units sold was tempered by Europe's continued grip on a strategically vital segment for single-aisle missions that need the most range. That allowed Airbus to secure a quarter of the deal in a high-margin niche where Boeing faces a gap in its portfolio, forcing it to ponder a new jet to replace the longer-range 757. Boeing appears to be calculating that the United deal will demonstrate that the MAX 10 fits the bill for some three-quarters of missions while it weighs options for a larger new model, analysts said, amid thin post-pandemic demand. Airbus, meanwhile, continues to pitch the A321neo as a \"premium\" product. COST IMPROVEMENT \"This is a great time to acquire capacity cheaply - the aircraft market remains depressed - and this will offer lasting structural cost improvement,\" said Carlos Ozores, vice-president at aviation consultancy ICF. After initial gains, Boeing shares ended down 1.8%, resuming losses triggered by delays in certifying the larger 777X. United and Airbus both eased 0.6%. Combined with existing orders, United will receive 500 new narrowbody aircraft including 40 in 2022 and 138 in 2023. It said it has flexibility on deliveries between 2024 and 2026 and the option to convert some MAX 10 orders to other variants. United, which unlike major rivals did not retire jets during the pandemic, said it plans to fly the first MAX 8 with the new interior this summer and the MAX 10 and A321neo in early 2023. The order includes 25 737 MAX \"white tails\" - jets canceled by other buyers during a 22-month grounding. The airline, which received $10.5 billion in government aid during the pandemic, devoted a large part of its release to a pledge to create 25,000 unionized jobs through the purchase. United said it expected to earn a pretax profit in July, its first since January 2020. Boeing, required to add MAX simulator training for pilots of earlier 737 models after software problems contributed to fatal MAX crashes, said the United deal includes simulator data. Airbus said a significant number of newly ordered A321neos would be assembled at its plant in Alabama.",

The world's largest aerospace contractor, Raytheon Technologies (RTX.N)New Tab , is dealing with shortages of microelectronics, rocket motors and structural castings. It has a total of 330 suppliers on its watch list. Chief Executive Greg Hayes said it is adding second or third sources for parts, but Raytheon, which bought United Technologies in 2020, doesn’t expect these pressures to ease until 2023. The industry is grappling with supply issues at a time when much of the air travel market except China is booming after a two-years slump. Delays in aircraft production and deliveries have made it tougher for airlines to add capacity. United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab , which is aiming to operate more flights next year, has flagged delays in aircraft delivery as a risk to its capacity plans. To stabilize production and address shortages of engines, raw materials and semiconductors, Boeing, for example, has parachuted more specialists into its suppliers' facilities. It is also carrying higher inventory to deal with any snags. In public, aerospace executives talk about working together but in practice small suppliers say the knock on the door from the final customer, Boeing or Airbus, can be a stressful wake-up call. Few are willing to discuss their glitches publicly. To be sure, manufacturers of all shapes and sizes have been struggling to produce enough to feed current demand and restock inventory after the pandemic fractured global supply chains. But until now, aerospace has avoided the scale of disruption faced by auto makers and machinery companies, as Boeing and Airbus were building significantly fewer jets than before the pandemic. Airbus is about half-way back to pre-pandemic output. A pick-up in demand has brought the strains to the fore. \"This is a ramp(-up) that's going to have us all very much on our toes,\" said General Electric Chief Executive Larry Culp. Culp, whose company supplies jet engines to both Airbus and Boeing, said there is \"no silver bullet\" to the supply-chain problems as it is a \"multi-year task\". GE has deployed one-fifth of its engineering team to deal with the bottlenecks, which emanate from various suppliers including family-run companies, according to industry sources. It is working to drive up production rates. Culp, who is broadening his role to include the aviation unit that led the conglomerate to higher-than-expected profit in the second quarter, said the measures had increased supplier throughput by as much as 30%. Still, supply-chain pressures shaved off 9 percentage points from GE's second-quarter aviation revenue. Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury told Reuters last week he was leaving Farnborough with a \"bit more comfort\" about engines, while Culp this week stressed the need for \"predictability and stability\".",

Archer and Wisk compete in the competitive yet unproven market for electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, or eVTOLs, that aim to revolutionize urban air mobility with vehicles that take off like helicopters and fly like planes. Wisk, formed through a joint venture between Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and Google co-founder Larry Page's Kitty Hawk Corp, accused Archer in April of stealing trade secrets and infringing on its patents. \"Wisk does not actually identify even a single Wisk trade secret ever used by, or even known to, Archer,\" the company said in a filing with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. It called Wisk's patent claims \"equally meritless and improper\" and provided details including drawings and analysis from a third-party consultant that it says are evidence of the independent creation of its aircraft design. Archer also filed counterclaims alleging that Wisk engaged in a media campaign to harm the company and disrupt its chances for success when it wrote in a blog post and told media that the FBI and U.S. Department of Justice are conducting a criminal investigation into Archer. \"That is a false statement that Wisk knew or should have known was untrue when Wisk posted it and that remains untrue today,\" Archer said. A spokeswoman for Wisk said Archer's filing \"confirms the strength of Wisk's claims,\" adding: \"We believe Archer’s business is built on Wisk’s intellectual property as detailed in our filings, and we look forward to proceeding with our case.\" Wisk's lawsuit was filed two months after Archer announced plans to go public through a $3.8 billion merger with Atlas Crest Investment Corp (ACIC.N)New Tab , special purpose acquisition company. Last week, Atlas Crest said in a regulatory filing that Archer and certain of its employees who previously worked for Wisk \"are involved in a federal investigation reviewing Archer's hiring practices and intellectual property.\"",

Tai told reporters in Washington the administration aims to hold China accountable to the two-year \"Phase 1\" trade deal signed in January 2020 and is exploring all weaknesses in China's performance, including its lack of purchases of commercial aircraft. She said the talks with Beijing on the Phase 1 deal are being twinned with discussions on larger issues, including China's \"extremely robust\" state-driven industrial policies that are making it difficult for U.S. companies to compete. \"I think that we consider this Phase 1 engagement to be the first step,\" Tai said. \"And it's not in my interest for this first step to take a very, very long time.\" China is running far behind in its promises in the deal to boost purchases of U.S. goods by $200 billion during 2020 and 2021, compared to 2017 levels, reaching only 60% of the target through Sept. 30New Tab , according to data compiled by trade economist Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The deal also includes promised steps by China to improve protections for U.S. intellectual property, and increase market access for U.S. agriculture biotechnology products and financial services. Asked if she was pushing in the talks for China to take steps to allow for purchases of Boeing (BA.N)New Tab commercial aircraft - a purchase category identified in the Phase 1 agreementNew Tab - Tai said: \"If you're looking at where the weaknesses might be, in terms of Phase 1, you should expect that we are talking through it and exploring all of it.\" U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping have a virtual meeting scheduled as early as next week amid rising tension between the world's two largest economies. Tai said the meeting would be helpful and their understanding of each other would benefit a complex relationship. But she said the leaders' engagement was not necessary to facilitate the trade discussions. \"I don't want any of you in this room thinking that we are not getting traction with our Chinese counterparts,\" Tai said. \"We're talking and we're working. So we don't need, you know, Dads to come in,\" she added, referring to Biden and Xi. Asked if the administration was considering easing tariffs on Chinese goods as a way to reduce inflationary pressures on the U.S. economy, Tai said USTR was viewing the \"Section 301\" tariffs on Chinese goods as part of a strategy to seek an advantageous position to more effectively compete with China.",

The world's largest planemaker said it was benefiting from the beginnings of a recovery in air travel demand, but cautioned that uneven global vaccination rates and the spreading Delta variant of COVID-19 left uncertainty over the recovery. Airbus said it expected to deliver 600 aircraft in 2021, up from a previous target of at least 566, and doubled its forecast for operating income to 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) while predicting 2 billion euros of free cashflow. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Airbus would deliver more than 600 jetsNew Tab this year after negotiating workarounds with cash-strapped airlines, including deals that allow some to delay accounting for new planes on their balance sheets. \"COVID-19 is not over,\" Chief Executive Guillaume Faury told reporters on Thursday. \"Levels of vaccinations are very diverse around the world and we cannot exclude that after the Delta variant there will be another one, so we believe we have to remain very prudent,\" he said, adding: \"It is going to a bumpy road in terms of recovery.\" Even so, shares in the Paris-listed heavyweight rose as much as 4.9%, helping to propel European shares to record highs. Stifel analyst Harry Breach said the stronger outlook reflected a growing share of high-margin A321neo jets in deliveries as well as the depth of cost cuts at Airbus, which is completing pandemic-related plans to reduce up to 15,000 jobs. Led by its commercial aerospace and helicopter divisions, Airbus swung to an operating profit of 2.01 billion euros in the second quarter, compared with a loss of 1.23 billion a year earlier, as revenue rose 70% to 14.18 billion euros. For the first half, Airbus posted operating earnings of 2.70 billion euros, eclipsing its previous full-year goal. Analysts were on average expecting 1.59 billion euros of operating profit on revenue of 14 billion euros in the second quarter, according to a company-compiled consensus. Its rival Boeing (BA.N)New Tab on Wednesday posted its first quarterly profitNew Tab in almost two years as revived domestic travel fuelled 737 MAX deliveries. Its shares rose 5%. Both planemakers face concerns about the slow recovery of long-haul travel. A pickup is badly needed to revive demand for wide-bodied jets that was sagging even before the crisis.

            "text": "Europe's chief aviation regulator pointed on Tuesday to a narrowing gap in talks with Boeing (BA.N)New Tab over cockpit design requirements for the future 777X airliner. European regulators have been seen at odds with Boeing for more than a year over changes they want in flight controls of the latest version of the 777 - a stand-off that has contributed to a cumulative five-year delay, according to industry sources. \"We are hopefully converging,\" Patrick Ky, executive director of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) told Reuters, when asked about the progress of ongoing discussions on the 777X. Boeing declined to comment. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Ky's remarks come shortly after industry sources said EASA held talks earlier this month with Boeing and the FAA to review certification expectations for the delayed jet. Ky did not specify where he saw signs of \"convergence\", but industry sources have said EASA is challenging the electronic safety net built in to flight controls of the 777X, whose introduction has gradually been pushed back to 2025. Officially, the European agency takes a back seat to the FAA in certifying U.S. airplanes. But the development of the world's largest twin-engined jetliner is widely seen as a test of EASA's increasing influence following a crisis over the Boeing 737 MAX. A major factor in two MAX crashes that killed 346 people was a single point of failure embedded in the flight controls. Although the decades-old architecture at the core of the 737 is radically different from the electronic cockpit of the larger and newer 777, EASA's approach reflects a sharper regulatory focus on safety backups in the aftermath of the MAX crisis. EASA has set out an approach that could prompt Boeing to add an extra fallback to guarantee that a single invisible failure within the cockpit's electronics cannot trigger simultaneous outages - a design precaution known as \"dissimilarity\". Ky's comment could suggest some progress on the question of \"dissimilarity\", although it remains unclear how quickly outstanding certification questions will be resolved. Industry sources say it has not been decided whether any new safeguards should be written into the 777X's flight control software or achieved as the result of hardware changes. Boeing has warned regulators that having two systems provided by two separate suppliers running in parallel would risk new problems by adding complexity, the sources said. U.S. executives argue the 777 jet, which is being upgraded to create the 400-seat 777X, is one of the industry's safest.",

            "text": "Universal Hydrogen, a U.S. firm that aims to do for clean fuel what Nespresso did for coffee, is poised to announce preliminary hydrogen deals with airlines including Icelandair (ICEAIR.IC)New Tab as it looks at a possible listing as early as next year. Europe's Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab has captured attention with a pledge to introduce 100-seat hydrogen-powered airliners by 2035. But founded by former Airbus technology chief Paul Eremenko, Universal Hydrogen aims to speed up the introduction of hydrogen for smaller regional airplanes to 2025 by using fuel cells fed by modular hydrogen capsules to replace their turboprop systems. \"It is a $2.5 billion market on a regional scale,\" Eremenko estimated in an interview. Universal Hydrogen is one of a cluster of companies flocking to efforts to decarbonise aviation and says it is trying to solve a crucial problem with the clean but highly flammable fuel: how to connect production to airports where it is needed. \"We are the Nespresso capsule of hydrogen. We don't grow the coffee and we don't make the coffee-maker,\" Eremenko told Reuters, referring to the Nestle division (NESN.S)New Tab whose capsules revolutionised premium coffee-drinking habits. In order to kickstart demand, Nespresso offered coffee makers while encouraging others to build compatible machines. \"It is a similar model for us ... Somebody has to build the first coffee maker and our version of that is to develop a conversion kit and offer that to regional airlines,\" he said. The kits include a fuel cell and electric powertrain to replace conventional turboprops built by Pratt & Whitney Canada (RTX.N)New Tab . Airlines' cost of investing in the kits can be offset against long-term contracts to supply fuel via modular capsules. From the viewpoint of a passenger, the propellers remain while the engine architecture and fuel system behind them change, with some seats removed to fit the hydrogen capsules. Under the tentative deals to be announced on Wednesday, details of which have been supplied to Reuters, Spanish regional airline Air Nostrum would buy 11 kits to convert current and future ATR (AIR.PA)New Tab , (LDOF.MI)New Tab 72-600 turboprop airplanes. Ravn Alaska, which last year inherited part of the operations of bankrupt Alaskan regional carrier RavnAir, would buy five conversion kits under a long-term hydrogen fuel deal. Icelandair would also buy conversion kits for its regional fleet as part of a long-term fuel supply deal. COST CHALLENGE Both Ravn and Icelandair operate De Havilland Canada DHC-8 turboprops, more widely known as Dash 8. Universal Hydrogen's kits can convert power systems used on Dash 8s or ATRs. Not everyone is confident hydrogen will quickly solve the sector's environmental challenges despite zero carbon emissions. A European Union climate masterplan due on Wednesday is expected to include ambitious targets for alternative aviation fuels made from sources like waste read more . Boeing (BA.N)New Tab has focused more on such sustainable fuels than hydrogen. Hurdles to be solved include cost and availability as well as uncertainty over how hydrogen systems will be certified. \"At the moment hydrogen is more expensive. We believe that in the future when hydrogen is more available it will become closer to being competitive,\" Icelandair Chief Operating Officer Jens Thordarson told Reuters, adding governments should also provide support for the zero-emission fuel. \"There is a good opportunity for Iceland to be an early adopter of these kinds of technologies,\" he added. Iceland has plentiful renewable energy to create so-called green hydrogen without relying on fossil fuels in production. Universal Hydrogen also plans to launch a design study with Deutsche Aircraft aimed at incorporating its capsules into a new version of the out-of-production Dornier 328 regional turboprop. The same German company last week announced a partnership with H2FLY, a fuel-cell developer based in Germany, with a view to demonstrating a hydrogen-powered Dornier 328 by 2025. Backed by investors including venture capital arms of Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab , Toyota (7203.T)New Tab and JetBlue (JBLU.O)New Tab , Universal Hydrogen recently raised funds and is now exploring interim 'Series B' financing as it ramps up industrially read more . Beyond this, it has its eye on joining a wave of listings via special acquisition vehicles or SPACs, \"depending on how the SPAC market evolves over the next year or so,\" Eremenko said. \"Hydrogen is the 100% decarbonisation solution and there is a willingness and need to start talking about such measures\".",

It forecast its 2024 performance to be in line with its estimates, as Boeing, one of its top customers, had asked suppliers to maintain production of 737 MAX plane parts at previously agreed levels. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given Boeing 90 days to develop a comprehensive plan to address \"systemic quality-control issues\" after restricting it from ramping up the production rate of 737 MAX planes from the current 38 planes a month. \"If you look at last year, for much of last year, the manufacturing rate was 31 per month.

The company's adjusted pre-tax profit jumped 91% to 38.3 million pounds ($48.5 million) for the year ended Dec. 31. Senior proposed an annual dividend of 2.3 pence, up 77%. Demand at its Flexonics division, which makes fluid conveyance and thermal management components for vehicles and power and energy applications, continued to normalise to more typical levels, the company added. \"Much of our product is either coming from North America or Europe, so we don't have to go through the Red Sea... So far, not a big impact for us,\" Squires said regarding any impact from disruptions to shipping via the Red Sea. ($1 = 0.7897 pounds)",

            "text": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Wednesday said it had approved Boeing Co's (BA.N)New Tab application to launch and operate 147 satellites to provide high-speed broadband internet access. Boeing first filed with the FCC in 2017 seeking approval to deploy a V-band Constellation of mostly low earth orbit satellites. The FCC did not approve Boeing’s request to operate inter-satellite links in certain frequency bands that are not allocated internationally for operations of the fixed-satellite service. There is a growing effort to deploy satellite-based internet service. In 2019, Elon Musk's SpaceX urged the FCC to reject Boeing's plan saying it presented a \"clear danger of harmful interference\" to other systems or \"at a minimum impose appropriate conditions to ensure that Boeing’s operations do not harm those of other\" operators. In April, the FCC voted to approve a SpaceX plan to deploy some Starlink satellites at a lower earth orbit than planned as part of its push to offer space-based broadband internet. SpaceX had asked the FCC for approval to fly 2,824 satellites at a lower orbit as part of the plan to provide high-speed broadband internet services to people who currently lack access. In July 2020, Amazon said it would invest more than $10 billion to build a network of 3,236 low-earth orbit satellites. read more On Monday Amazon asked the FCC for approval to launch and operate two prototype satellites. SpaceX, which plans to eventually deploy 12,000 satellites in total, has said previously the Starlink constellation will cost it roughly $10 billion. While extremely costly to deploy, satellite technology can provide high-speed internet for people who live in rural or hard-to-serve places where fiber optic cables and cell towers do not reach. The technology could also be a critical backstop when hurricanes or other natural disasters disrupt communication.",

In the medium term, however, tighter regulation will cause delays and it could take until the end of the decade for the industry to make up the production shortfall experienced since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Avolon CEO Andy Cronin said in an interview. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Wednesday froze planned increases in production of the 737 MAX following the blow-out of a panel on an Alaska Airlines (ALK.N)New Tab Boeing jet, raising concerns for airlines and suppliers worldwide. Avolon, the world's third-largest aircraft lessor and a major Boeing customer with over 100 MAX aircraft on order, said it was not concerned about the plane's safety, but regulators' increased focus on production was set to result in production delays. \"They'll clearly be very cautious now,\" Cronin said. Avolon, a subsidiary of China's Bohai Leasing Co Ltd (000415.SZ)New Tab , estimates the shortfall in planned aircraft production in the wake of COVID equals 12% of annual production and is growing. A combination of quality and supply chain issues and manufacturing delays \"will continue to elongate the recovery time, which at this point, is through the end of this decade,\" Cronin said. But ultimately Boeing has the technical expertise and production know-how to get back on track, he said. \"This will come together and will get resolved.\" The number of MAX aircraft that will not be delivered due to the FAA's decision to halt the production expansion \"is actually relatively minimal\" so long as Boeing can consistently maintain its 38 per month production rate, Cronin said. \"I don't think anyone's overly agitated,\" he said. Cronin declined to forecast when the MAX 10, the largest MAX model, will be certified, but said he was confident it would happen. Boeing had planned to secure certification this year, but major customer Ryanair said it expects it in 2025. Avolon on Friday published its annual outlook, predicting the value of new aircraft deliveries would increase by 15% in 2024 to $100 billion, while airlines' net profit would rise by 10% to $26 billion.",

U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman in Manhattan found the defendant AirBridgeCargo Airlines LLC and its parent Volga-Dnepr Logistics BV liable, after the invasion and resulting sanctions left the plaintiff BOC Aviation unable to reclaim the aircraft. Lawyers for the defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. BOC declined comment. Aircraft lessors have sued multiple insurers and lessees in mainly European courts for billions of dollars over hundreds of aircraft stuck in Russia since Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. BOC Aviation said AirBridgeCargo went into default after being unable to maintain required reinsurance coverage. This followed restrictions imposed by the European Union against Russian carriers on aircraft used in Russia, and Russian sanctions on foreign assets, including internationally leased aircraft. BOC Aviation said it was able to recover one leased plane and two of its four engines, while the two other planes and two other engines remained in Russia. The lessor's majority shareholder is Bank of China Ltd (601988.SS)New Tab . In a 57-page decision, Liman said BOC Aviation had proven that the Russian government had \"effected a seizure\" of the planes and engines by keeping them from being used outside Russia, \"save perhaps to areas in Ukraine or for the purposes of the war.\" The judge said that undermined BOC Aviation's ability to carry out its right to reclaim possession. He also rejected AirBridgeCargo's defenses that neither side could have foreseen a default, and it was impossible to ground the planes outside Russia because the country had ordered them flown back. Similar arguments have been set out in other cases, but the lack of standardised terms and a tradition of contractual secrecy in the jet industry has made it difficult for lessors to pool their claims into one class action, industry sources say, Liman ruled after a one-day non-jury trial held on April 3. The case is BOC Aviation Ltd v AirBridgeCargo Airlines LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 22-02070.",

            "text": "Amazon (AMZN.O)New Tab on Friday said it booked three Falcon 9 launches with Elon Musk's SpaceX to help deploy the ecommerce giant's Project Kuiper satellite network, tapping a rival in the satellite internet business for its multi-billion dollar launch campaign. Amazon aims to build Kuiper as a constellation of 3,236 satellites in low Earth orbit to beam broadband internet globally and compete with SpaceX's Starlink network, which already has some 5,000 satellites providing nearly global coverage. Amazon, which vowed in 2019 to invest $10 billion into the project, will put an unspecified number of Kuiper satellites on three Falcon 9 rockets from SpaceX beginning in mid-2025, the company said Friday. The Falcon 9 missions add to 83 rocket launches it had already procured from Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin, the Boeing-Lockheed (BA.N)New Tab , (LMT.N)New Tab joint venture United Launch Alliance and Europe's Arianespace in a multi-billion dollar launch deal. Amazon was sued by a shareholder in August for not adequately considering SpaceX as a launch provider when it was selecting most of the 83 other rides to space in late 2021 and 2022. The company said the lawsuit's claims \"are completely without merit.\" Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund, a fund that lodged the suit in a Delaware court, said in its complaint the launch contracts were the second-largest capital expenditure in Amazon's history at the time. Amazon's largest acquisition is its $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods in 2017. Amazon's announcement that it added SpaceX rockets to its launch campaign comes just three days before its deadline to lodge a substantive defense against the shareholder lawsuit, according to a court scheduling order. Amazon in September filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, saying it would detail its defense in a later briefing. On Friday, the same day as Amazon's SpaceX announcement, the court set a deadline of Dec. 4 for Amazon to outline its motion to dismiss. SpaceX's partially reusable Falcon 9 rockets have been a crucial advantage over rivals in its rapid deployment of Starlink, a fast-growing internet network that made the Musk-owned company the world's largest satellite operator. Eutelsat's OneWeb, another satellite internet rival, relied on Russia's Soyuz rocket for deploying the bulk of its network. But OneWeb turned to SpaceX when Russia invaded Ukraine and seized $50 million worth of the company's satellites. U.S. regulators require Amazon to deploy half of the Kuiper network by 2026. The company launched its first two prototype satellites in orbit in October and announced successful tests last month. Amazon expects to deploy enough satellites for \"early customer pilots\" in the second half of 2024. It plans to use United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 and the yet-to-launch Vulcan rocket for the first few batches of satellites.",

            "text": "More travelers are checking the model of an aircraft before booking flights after a midair cabin blowout forced a new Alaska Airlines-operated Boeing jet to make an emergency landing and grounded more than 170 planes, several travel operators said. A piece of fuselage tore off the left side of the 737 MAX 9 jetliner operated by Alaska Airlines (ALK.N)New Tab as it climbed following takeoff on Friday, forcing pilots to turn back and land safely with all 171 passengers and six crew on board. U.S. regulators have since grounded 171 737 MAX 9 planes for safety checks while Alaska and United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab , which together have 70% of the 737 MAX 9 fleet, have canceled hundreds of flights this week. The Alaska crew have been praised for swiftly landing the plane, with only minor injuries to those on board. But photos on social media showing oxygen masks deployed and a portion of the aircraft's side wall missing, as well provisional checks turning up loose bolts in some grounded planes, stirred concerns it would dent passenger confidence in Boeing planes. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun on Tuesday acknowledged mistakes and told staff he and many customers had been \"shaken to the bone.\" Boeing must work to earn their confidence, he said. On Thursday, Ryanair (RYA.I)New Tab Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said passengers had not shown any concern about flying on Boeing 737 aircraft since the grounding. Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers is one of Boeing's largest customers and operates different variants of the 737 MAX from the type that has been grounded. \"We see no indication of any passenger concern ... not one passenger,\" O'Leary told Reuters, adding that the biggest threat to the MAX came when it was grounded for nearly two years in 2019 following two crashes. Even so, Booking Holdings (BKNG.O)New Tab -owned Kayak said it has seen a spike in the use of a filter on its website that allows customers to screen by plane model following Friday's incident. It has moved the filter up on its website to make it more prominent and added the ability to check specifically for the 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 models. MAX 8 aircraft are still in service. Internova Travel Group, which represents more than 100,000 travel advisors worldwide, has also seen more queries about plane models. \"The consumer who is aware of the situation is asking our agents, 'is this an impacted plane?' said Peter Vlitas, an executive at the company. When the MAX 9 jet resumes service, he said Internova agents will inform customers which model plane they will be booked on to regain client confidence. The biggest headache for travelers this week has been rearranging flights after cancellations by United and Alaska this week, said Paul Charles, chief executive of the travel consultancy PC Agency. The UK's travel agent trade body ABTA said it has not had any calls from members of the public or travel agency members about the issue. Other travel companies like Tripadvisor (TRIP.O)New Tab said it was too soon to track a major shift in booking or travel habits. Even so, Kelly Sites, 37, said she had grown wary of Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircrafts following the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airline crashes in 2018 and 2019 and now she will also be avoiding MAX 9 jets. \"As someone who is not an aviation expert, I would personally rather be safe than sorry because you don’t really see this type of information coming out about any other aircraft,\" she said. Some, though, have added plane model to their list of criteria along with price and amenities when booking a trip. \"This incident has made us realize that there is another step that we need to add to our checklist while booking a flight,\" said Chaitra Yangandul, a Washington DC-based travel content creator.",

The planemaker will also deploy a team to supplier Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N)New Tab - which makes and installs the plug door involved in the incident - to check and approve Spirit's work on the plugs before fuselages are sent to Boeing's production facilities in Washington state, Stan Deal, president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a letter to Boeing employees. The new actions from Boeing come after the Federal Aviation Administration on Friday extended the grounding of 171 MAX 9 planes indefinitely for new safety checks. Only after 40 planes are inspected will the agency review the results and determine if safety is adequate to allow the MAX 9s to resume flying, the FAA said. In addition to the door plug inspections, Boeing teams will conduct checks at 50 other points in Spirit's production process, Deal said. Meanwhile, both Boeing and Spirit will open their 737 production facilities to airline customers for carriers to provide their own inspections. “We are working seamlessly with Boeing in executing on the FAA’s Quality Management System (QMS) in the production and manufacturing of the 737 MAX 9,” said a Spirit spokesperson in a statement to Reuters. Boeing will also hold sessions for employees on quality management, and bring in an outside party to conduct an independent assessment of its production process, Deal said. Alaska Airlines said it had \"engaged in a candid conversation\" with Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun and the planemaker's leadership team on the quality improvement actions. \"We welcome and appreciate Boeing’s specific commitments to bolster quality assurance and controls across their factories and at Spirit AeroSystems,\" Alaska Airlines said. The FAA declined to comment. Deal said the actions laid out in the letter are separate from the FAA's ongoing investigation and plans to increase oversight of MAX production. However, before new MAX 9s are delivered, Boeing \"will conduct the same thorough inspections of the mid-exit door plugs as mandated by the FAA,\" Deal wrote. The regulator announced last week it will also audit the Boeing 737 MAX 9 production line and suppliers and consider having an independent entity take over certain aircraft certification responsibilities the FAA previously assigned to the planemaker.

The memo from Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Stan Deal following the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's six-week audit of Boeing's 737 MAX manufacturing processes that faulted numerous company processes. The FAA has curbed Boeing production following the mid-air panel blowout on a new Alaska Airlines (ALK.N)New Tab 737 MAX 9 jet on January 5. \"Our teams are working to simplify and streamline our processes and address the panel’s recommendations,\" the memo said, noting that employees have to focus on looking out for safety hazards and follow manufacturing processes precisely. \"We will not hesitate in stopping a production line or keeping an airplane in position.\" The memo comes a day after FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker disclosed details of the audit found numerous quality issues and the planemaker must have employees \"have the right tools and training, having the right engineering drawings and assembling the aircraft in the proper order ... It's really plant floor hygiene.\" Deal said FAA inspectors went deep into the 737 Renton factories in January and February to audit production and quality control and found the \"vast majority of our audit non-compliances involved not following our approved processes and procedures.\" The weekly compliance checks for 737 work sites start March 1 and Boeing is dedicating time in each shift for mechanics to complete compliance and foreign object debris sweeps. Boeing is also auditing all toolboxes and removing any tools not fully compliant and will conduct additional 737 program audits to ensure full compliance. Deal said workers must \"precisely follow every step of our manufacturing procedures and processes. These have been designed to ensure conformance to specifications and compliance to regulatory requirements.\" Deal also said with Spirit AeroSystems(SPR.N)New Tab Boeing has \"implemented additional inspection points at their facility in Wichita. As such, starting March 1, teams there have been ensuring first-pass quality before any fuselages are shipped to Renton.\"",

            "text": "Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N)New Tab on Wednesday took a hefty $110 million loss in reach-forward charges on Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab jet production and expects a further hit of $31 million to full-year gross profit from disruptions related to a Boeing 737 MAX fuselage production problem. The company announced $110 million in charges on the Airbus A220, Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 during its first-quarter results. Losses on the A220 amounted to about $81 million, including $46 million in nonrecurring supply-chain costs that were due to a \"distressed supplier,\" Spirit CEO Tom Gentile told investors in an earnings call. Those losses are piling up just a month after Boeing paused deliveries of some 737 MAXs due to a problem involving two fittings that join the aft fuselage made by Spirit to the vertical tail, which were not attached correctly. Spirit's first-quarter profit decreased by $17 million as a result of the 737 issue, and \"additional costs are expected\" beyond the $31 million headwind to profit expected this year, \"including costs Boeing may assert to repair certain models of previously delivered units in their factory and warranty costs related to affected 737 units in service,\" the company said. \"However, the company cannot reasonably estimate the remaining potential costs at this time,\" it added. Spirit AeroSystems shares closed down 12.3% at $26.28 on Wednesday. Spirit now expects cash burn of about $100 million to $150 million in 2023 due to the risk of lowered 737 fuselage deliveries. It initially projected 420 deliveries this year, but may deliver only up to 390 fuselages for 737s, Gentile said. In addition to the A220 loss, the company took an $18 million A350 charge prompted by additional costs related to production schedule changes, and an $8 million loss on the 787 Dreamliner due to increased labor and supply-chain issues. Analysts had expected a tough quarter for Spirit due to the ongoing 737 problem, but \"it looks like the cost of 737 rework could be below some of the most dire estimates,\" said J.P. Morgan analyst Seth Seifman in a note to investors. Rework costs for affected 737 fuselages at Spirit's Wichita, Kansas-based production facility are projected to amount to $5 million, an expense of about $100,000-$150,000 per plane. Repair work to fuselages in Spirit's factory is expected to be completed by the end of July. The company has also started to build and deliver production-conforming 737 fuselages under a revised process, it said. About 500 in-service 737s are suspected of being affected by the bracket defect, Gentile said. Because the problem is not a flight safety issue, impacted jets will be inspected and fixed during maintenance, but Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration have not yet determined the timing for inspections, Gentile said. Spirit expects to receive a $180 million cash advance from Boeing in the second quarter, which Gentile said would provide \"additional surplus and cushion.\" Boeing said last week it was contributing \"manufacturing and engineering resources\" to Spirit after the company discovered the 737 bracket issue. Spirit reported a first-quarter adjusted loss per share of $1.69, wider than analyst expectations of a 30-cent loss per share, as per Refinitiv data. It reported $1.4 billion in revenue, missing the analyst consensus of $1.5 billion. Cash burn was $69 million in the first quarter, compared with a cash burn of $298 million a year ago.",

            "text": "Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab won a consolation order for 15 A350-900 jets from Emirates on Thursday after a public row between the Mideast giant and engine maker Rolls-Royce (RR.L)New Tab prevented a bigger deal for European jets at a Dubai Airshow dominated by Boeing. Emirates Chairman and CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said the long-haul jets would \"add to our fleet mix, and we are pleased to announce additional orders for this aircraft type\". However, industry sources described the deal as a face-saving compromise after the influential carrier criticised the amount of maintenance needed to keep the engines for the larger A350-1000 flying in hot and sandy conditions of the Gulf. Sheikh Ahmed said Emirates would \"work closely with Airbus and Rolls-Royce to ensure our aircraft deliver the best possible operating efficiency and flying experience for our customers\". The deal, which Emirates said was worth $6 billion, followed intense negotiations focusing on the needs of the Gulf as it fends off new competition from Turkey, India and elsewhere to its East-West transit model, while shedding light on broader industry tensions over rising engine costs. Emirates is by far the biggest user of the Airbus A380 after investing heavily in the world's largest airliner, and is now planning the fleet needed to keep its Dubai super-hub at the centre of the aviation map beyond the 2030s as the A380 retires. The airline opened this week's air show with a $52 billion order for 90 Boeing 777X airplanes, saying the U.S. planemaker appeared to be getting a grip on regulatory and other problems surrounding its entry to service after five years of delays. But Emirates Airline President Tim Clark refused to place a large order for Airbus' broadly similar A350-1000 and blasted Rolls-Royce over the disruption and cost of dealing with frequent maintenance needed to keep the plane's engines running. Emirates would have ordered 35-50 of the planes, he said. Rolls-Royce acknowledged its engine for the A350-1000 would need more servicing than Emirates would like, but denied Clark's suggestion that the XWB-97 engine was \"defective\". Chief Customer Officer Ewen McDonald said deal for the A350-900, which uses a different variant of engine, was a sign of the airline's trust in Rolls-Royce and held out hope for a future order for the A350-1000. \"We will continue our discussions with Emirates on the A350-1000 engine improvements and look forward to them choosing this aircraft in the future,\" he said. Emirates has already ordered 50 A350-900s which are scheduled to arrive from August next year. Delegates said earlier a top-up order would be seen as a consolation prize for Airbus and Rolls-Royce after Boeing and its main engine supplier GE won the majority of deals, but would leave questions over Airbus's ability to compete with Boeing's 777X in the lucrative Gulf market. \"It is...just to keep the relationship going and so they can talk again,\" a senior aviation industry source said. Investors are expected to quiz Rolls-Royce about the durability and pricing of its engines at a Nov. 28 investor day. Rolls-Royce said earlier in week it was looking at applying technology from its Ultrafan research project to the XWB-97. In a week dominated by soaring demand for wide-body planes, Boeing won new orders for 196 aircraft while Airbus agreed deals for 55 jets. Airbus said it had reached an \"agreement in principle\" for a significant order from Turkish Airlines (THYAO.IS)New Tab , but industry sources said the deal had not yet been signed. Emirates also agreed to buy five additional 787 Dreamliners, while sister airline flyDubai went for 30 with its first wide-body order. Although political power is consolidated in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi, Monday's high-profile announcement overseen by Dubai's crown prince was symbolic of the value the UAE places on its bilateral relationship with the United States after a recent period of strain, said sources familiar with the matter. In other business, Turkey-based budget carrier SunExpress announced an order for 45 Boeing 737 MAX narrow-bodies and used the spotlight to issue a reminder of the industry's supply chain problems. Ethiopian Airlines announced it was buying 20 737 MAX jets nearly five years after the fatal 2019 MAX crash that led to the grounding of the global fleet. It also ordered 11 Dreamliners. EgyptAir said it was ordering 10 A350-900s from Airbus, while AirBaltic announced it was buying 30 Airbus A220-300s. Royal Air Maroc signed a repeat order for two additional 787 Dreamliners. EgyptAir said it would lease 18 new Boeing 737 MAX jets from Air Lease Corp (AL.N)New Tab .",

            "text": "Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab investors have reached an agreement with current and former company officers to settle a lawsuit over the safety oversight of the 737 MAX, two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The proposed settlement agreement is expected to be filed in the coming days in Delaware Chancery Court, and is subject to approval by a judge, the people said. It would likely include provisions to increase internal safety oversight, they said. One of the people added that the monetary portion of the agreement could be around $250 million, and would be paid by insurers. A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment. Lawyers representing the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The settlement agreement was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal. In an amended complaint unsealed in February, New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who heads the state pension fund, and other investors argued that Boeing's board had breached its fiduciary duties and acted with gross negligence by failing \"to monitor the safety of Boeing's 737 MAX airplanes.\" The lawsuit, also filed in Delaware Chancery Court, alleges that the board did not develop any tools to evaluate and monitor airplane safety until after 737 MAX crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia killed 346 people in a span of five months, and the fleet was grounded. In March, Boeing asked the Delaware court to throw out the shareholders' lawsuit, saying the board had engaged in \"robust and well-established\" oversight of jet's development. In its motion to dismiss the complaint, Boeing said the plaintiffs ignored \"the robust systems that had long been in place\" to keep the board informed about significant risk issues. \"Boeing's Directors maintained this high scrutiny, moreover, during a period in which commercial aircraft, and Boeing's in particular, achieved ever higher levels of safety,\" Boeing said, \"a trend that cannot be squared with Plaintiffs' simplistic narrative about a 'safety-engineering culture' that had been 'intentionally dismantled.'\" Since 2019, Boeing's board has improved oversight of Boeing's engineering and industrial operations, and added new board members. The settlement agreement was expected to add additional oversight. Boeing acknowledged, as part of a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Justice Department in January, that the company concealed details about a crucial flight control system at the center of the two crashes from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.",

The two planes came close to colliding when the FedEx plane was forced to overfly the Southwest plane to avoid a crash, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters. \"Shortly before the FedEx aircraft was due to land, the controller cleared Southwest Flight 708 to depart from the same runway,\" the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said. The NTSB separately said it was investigating \"a possible runway incursion and overflight involving airplanes from Southwest Airlines and FedEx.\" The incident occurred in poor visibility conditions in Austin. The FAA said FedEx Express Flight 1432, a Boeing 767 cargo plane, which had departed from Memphis, was cleared to land on Runway 18-Left around 6:40 a.m. while the aircraft was several miles from the airport. The Southwest plane had not yet departed when the FedEx plane was nearing the runway. \"The pilot of the FedEx airplane discontinued the landing and initiated a climb out,\" the FAA said. It was not clear precisely how close the two airplanes came to colliding, but flight tracking website data suggested they came very close. The Cancun, Mexico-bound Southwest flight, a Boeing 737-700, safely departed and landed at 9:47 a.m. ET. Southwest declined to comment.

Boeing said it does not comment on conversations it might have with its customers. Tata did not respond to an email seeking comment. Bloomberg reported on Thursday that Tata had begun preliminary discussions with the planemakers and lessors for jets including Airbus A350-900s and Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, citing people familiar with the matter. The airline, with its maharajah mascot, was once renowned for its lavishly decorated planes and stellar service championed by founder JRD Tata. Air India was founded in 1932 and nationalised in 1953. Since the mid-2000s, however, Air India's reputation has declined as financial troubles mounted. It flew widebody planes with business class seats in poor repair and grounded some of its new 787s to use for spare parts. Tata, the autos-to-steel conglomerate, operates two other airlines: Vistara, in a joint venture with Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI)New Tab , and AirAsia India, which it operates in partnership with AirAsia Group .",

Over 150 Chinese passengers were on the flight which vanished en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014. Malaysian investigators did not rule out the possibility that the aircraft had been deliberately taken off course, and debris confirmed or believed to be from the aircraft has washed up along the coast of Africa and on islands in the Indian Ocean. Relatives of these passengers said they were demanding compensation from Malaysia Airlines, Boeing, aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce and Allianz insurance group among others. The court did not release any details on the case, but state media said more than 40 relatives were seeking between 10 million and 80 million yuan ($1.4 million and $11.2 million) each in compensation. Malaysia Airlines, Rolls-Royce, Allianz and Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Holding up signs saying \"resume the search\" and \"re-establish an international investigation team\", Jiang Hui, a spokesperson for the bereaved families, said Malaysia Airlines left them with no choice but to go to court to seek answers. \"'We are not responsible anymore' is their attitude,\" said Jiang, whose mother was on board. There was a heavy police presence outside Chaoyang District People's Court in Beijing before the hearing, with reporters cordoned off and unable to interact with the family members. Some of the relatives, who spoke to reporters after the hearing, said they wanted the resumption of search efforts and for Malaysia Airlines to directly communicate with them as well as to provide them with psychological counselling. Many said these demands were more important than the monetary compensation. \"My mother died last year and she brought up my son. Until the very end I hid from her what really happened to him,\" said Beijing resident Bao Lanfang, 71, who lost her son and daughter-in-law on board. She said her husband had recently died after suffering from severe depression because of the incident. In March, another group of relatives urged the Malaysian government to allow U.S. seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to mount a new search for the missing plane.",

Congress earlier this year created a $3 billion aviation manufacturing payroll subsidy program that will cover up to half of eligible companies' compensation costs for as long as six months. Ohio-based Parker-Hannifin Corp (PH.N)New Tab was offered up to $39.7 million, Connecticut-based Hexcel Corp (HXL.N)New Tab offered $20.9 million and Astronics Corp (ATRO.O)New Tab $14.7 million. The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Of the 313 companies receiving funds, 188 of them - 60% - had fewer than 100 employees at the end of calendar year 2020. The funds will help support as many as 22,500 jobs nationwide. U.S. Senator Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, said 31 Kansas companies will receive $104 million in payroll grants including Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems. Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said $41 million will go to 32 companies in her home state of Washington. \"With aviation manufacturing not targeted to recover until well into 2022, at the earliest, this aviation protection program will help in hiring back some of those workers and staving off further layoffs at a critical time,\" said Cantwell, a Democrat. More than 100,000 jobs have been lost in the aerospace industry since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Transportation Department. Before then, the U.S. aerospace industry employed approximately 2.2 million workers, including 1.2 million who worked in various parts of the supply chain nationwide. The offer requires companies to commit to not conducting furloughs without employee consent or laying off employees covered by subsidies during the six-month period. Companies eligible include aircraft, engine, propeller or component manufacturers and companies that repair or overhaul airplanes and parts. To qualify, a company must have involuntarily furloughed or laid off at least 10% of its total workforce, or have experienced a decline of at least 15% in 2020 total operating revenue. Applications for a second round of funding closed Sept. 1 and additional funding recipients will be announced this fall, the Transportation Department said. Some big aviation companies like General Electric Co's (GE.N)New Tab GE Aviation and Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab declined to apply for the subsidy.",

            "text": "Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab said on Wednesday it is rolling out a data modeling tool aimed at helping airlines and policymakers determine the quickest, most efficient path to reducing aviation emissions to zero by 2050. The tool, known as Cascade, allows users to adjust different variables – such as the use of sustainable fuels or electric propulsion, the replacement of older-model aircraft, operational improvements and other advanced technologies – to better understand how those factors could result in decreases to carbon emissions over time. Boeing unveiled a beta version of Cascade in July 2022 but it was not publicly available. Over the past year, the model has been improved so that users can project data out to 2050 instead of visualizing only a single point in time, the company said. Boeing officials believe it will take a \"collection\" of technology or process changes to move the needle on emissions, Boeing Chief Sustainability Officer Chris Raymond said on Wednesday during an event hosted by the U.S. planemaker and attended by airline and government officials. But Raymond added that sustainable aviation fuel provides the most immediate pathway for the aviation sector to cut its carbon footprint, as it can immediately be used by airlines while advances in electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft may not be mature enough to meaningfully reduce emissions ahead of 2050. The public launch of Cascade comes just days after U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg met with counterparts from Canada, the United Kingdom and Singapore at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to discuss investments in sustainable aviation fuel. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that European Union countries are set to finalize SAF targets for airports despite some pushback from airlines. SAF – which is derived from waste feedstocks like cooking oil – remains expensive and scarce, with total SAF production in the United States in 2022 making up less than 0.1% of the total jet fuel used by major U.S. airlines, according to the Government Accountability Office. “Our intent is to scale SAF and help it scale by first ... examining what has to change in an airplane to be 100% compatible with (SAF),” Raymond said. “We have to help advocate for the policies that will help the industry scale up (production).” Boeing announced plans in February to double its SAF purchases in 2023, buying 5.6 million gallons of fuel from Neste (NESTE.HE)New Tab .",

There are a lot of opportunities in supplying for the structure of the aircraft and there are also large titanium requirements, he said, adding there will also be demand for maintenance, repair and overhaul of aircraft parts. Godrej Aerospace already exports some key components to engine makers General Electric (GE) and Rolls-Royce (RR.L)New Tab , Behramkamdin said after a media tour of its plant in Mumbai. The company expects its civil aviation business to clock revenues of 1 billion rupees ($12 million) in the current fiscal year, making up 35% of Godrej's total revenues, he said in an interview, adding that he expects this to grow to 50% next year. India has been pushing for indigenous manufacturing as well as local sourcing of components for aerospace and defence, and companies like Airbus and Boeing have recently committed to more local manufacturing and investment. Godrej Aerospace will also pitch to manufacture modules of GE 414 engines and become part of the supply chain for the work horses that will power the next generation of Indian fighter jets. Under a deal announced during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit to the U.S. last month, the engines will be made jointly by GE (GE.N)New Tab and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). Godrej Aerospace said separately in a statement it is planning to invest 2.5 billion rupees ($30 million) to build a new facility in Khalapur in Maharashtra for advanced manufacturing and assembly and integration facilities.",

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS)New Tab fell 0.8% led by a 3.5% decline on the Hang Seng tech index (.HSTECH)New Tab after China's internet watchdog said it plans stricter registration rules for younger net users. Japan's Nikkei (.N225)New Tab fell 0.6%. U.S. stock markets are at record highs but futures , , were listless amid creeping worries about central bankers' responses to inflation. FTSE futures were flat and European futures fell 0.3%. The latest evidence of worldwide pressure on consumer prices came from Australia, where data showed core inflation hit a six-year high last quarter. read more The Aussie dollar rose and bonds dived to reflect bets the central bank cannot hold rates at record lows. Two-year U.S. Treasury yields surged to a 19-month high of 0.5010% ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting. \"There are a couple of things that are of concern to investors, and inflation news is everywhere,\" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ Bank in Singapore. \"This is where expectations of when the Fed might start to lift interest rates is starting to come in to focus. The announcement of tapering next week is pretty much a done deal - markets have moved past tapering and are focused on tightening.\" The Fed has all but confirmed it will soon start to whittle back its asset purchases, though has said that shouldn't signal rate hikes are imminent. Nevertheless, Fed funds futures are priced for a lift-off in the second half of next year. \"We updated our Fed call to show a hike in Q4 2022 and four hikes in 2023,\" analysts at NatWest said in a note. \"The inflation overshoot has been persistent,\" they said. \"There is (only) so much the Fed can tolerate before reacting ... it feels inevitable that that conversation will be brought up more and more as we go into next year.\" EARNINGS SUPPORT In China, besides a further tightening of rules over online access for the young, energy stocks suffered with new measures to curb zooming coal prices which also dropped 10% and have fallen 40% from record peaks. read more That seemed to cap gains in the Australian dollar , which settled around 0.3% higher at $0.7526. Three year Australian government bond futures plunged about 19 basis points to their lowest since mid-2019. Broader currency markets were quiet as traders look to central bank meetings over the next week or so for guidance, with Canada first up at 1400 GMT. The Canadian dollar hovered just below last week's four month high. The European Central Bank meets on Thursday, when Bank of Japan also concludes its two-day meeting. No changes are expected from Tokyo, but traders are expecting the ECB to push back on market inflation forecasts and are looking for hawkish clues from the Bank of Canada as prices put pressure on rates. Earnings reports from Ford (F.N)New Tab , Coca-Cola (KO.N)New Tab , McDonald's (MCD.N)New Tab and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab are due later in the day.

            "text": "irked by edgy inflation updates, obstinate central bankers, a mixed start to the earnings season and worrying pockets of economic weakness. Still murky geopolitical developments in the Red Sea and elsewhere and what that may mean for shipping and goods prices, the onset of U.S. election year and congressional budgetary wrangling have also helped sap bond and stock markets. With global stocks (.MIWD00000PUS)New Tab now tracking losses for the year so far of some 1.5%, China's latest economic data dump did little to improve the mood on Wednesday. In numbers seemingly leaked by Premier Li Qiang at Davos on Tuesday, China said its economy grew 5.2% in 2023 - below consensus forecasts and twinned with a retail sales miss for December and another mixed industrial picture. The numbers upped the ante for further monetary and fiscal support, something that's knocked the yuan back to two-month lows against a resurgent dollar (.DXY)New Tab . The benchmark Chinese stock index (.CSI300)New Tab , which has now underperformed MSCI's all country index by a whopping 34% over the past year, dropped another 2% on Wednesday. Alongside the ongoing property sector bust and exit of foreign capital due to political tensions, China has even bigger problems ahead. The world's second biggest economy said its population fell for a second consecutive year in 2023 as a record low birth rate threatens profound long-term effects on the economy's growth potential. Elsewhere on Tuesday, Britain joined Canada - and the United States - in reporting above-forecast headline inflation for December. While different cuts on the momentum of disflation more broadly made it difficult to overinterpret the latest surprises, they have doused early rate cut bets in both countries and hit their respective bond markets. European Central Bank officials have been throwing cold water on easing talk all week. Back on Wall St, the speculation about when the Federal Reserve will first cut rates this year continues to ebb and flow - even though market pricing remains pretty aggressive on the scale of easing ahead. Futures market continue to see a two thirds chance of a rate cut as soon as March and 150 basis points of cuts by year-end. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on Tuesday the U.S. is \"within striking distance\" of the Fed's 2% inflation goal, but the central bank should not rush to cut its rate cuts. New York Fed boss John Williams and Fed governor Michelle Bowman speak later. Treasury markets seem more restive, with a backup in 10-year yields to the highest of the year so far and two-year yields bouncing back 16 bps in just two days to 4.28%. With Bank of America's latest fund manager survey flagged a big pullback from longer-term bonds despite an overwhelming consensus lower yields in 2024, markets will keep close tabs on the near doubling to $2 trillion of new Treasury debt sales this year. But, aided in part by China growth worries, oil prices provided better news for bond markets on Tuesday and crude slipped again to resume annual losses of more than 10%. Wall St stock futures remained in the red after Tuesday's lower close for the S&P500, with a mixed readout on the fourth quarter from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs yesterday that hit the former's stock by about 5%. Boeing (BA.N)New Tab also slumped again by almost 8% to a two-month low after the Federal Aviation Administration extended the grounding of its 737 MAX 9 airplanes indefinitely. December retail sales and regional U.S. banks top the diary today alongside the latest sweep of Fed speakers.

            "text": "French jet engine maker Safran (SAF.PA)New Tab on Friday backed plans by Airbus to raise its core single-aisle production above 65 jets a month, but warned that fragile global supply chains would determine whether planemakers were able to hit targets. The company, which is General Electric's (GE.N)New Tab joint partner in the world's biggest engine maker by number of units, CFM International, has been sceptical in the past about plans by Airbus for a sharp increase in output to meet rebounding travel demand. Safran has embraced plans to lift output of A320neo single-aisle jets to 65 a month from about 45 a month now but held back from committing engine volumes for a further sprint to 75 a month. Chief Executive Olivier Andries said on Friday, however, that a record order for Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab airplanes from Air India this week and other signs of rising demand demonstrated the case for higher output. But he stopped short of endorsing Airbus' calls to go as high as 75, which have been questioned by some other suppliers and lessors. CFM competes with Pratt & Whitney (RTX.N)New Tab to power the A320neo and is the sole engine maker for the Boeing 737 MAX. \"Demand is clearly very strong, which is confirmed by the recent Air India announcement, and it supports an increase in production above the 65 a month that was being envisaged before the crisis,\" Andries said in comments emailed to Reuters. \"The pace of this rate increase will in reality be determined by the capacity of suppliers to follow,\" he added. \"We have an agreement with our (planemaking) clients on the volumes to supply in 2023 and 2024 and our absolute priority is to respect these commitments,\" he added. Under a shallower production plan announced on Thursday following supply disruption, Airbus aims to reach production of 65 a month by the end of 2024 and to hit 75 a month in 2026.",

            "title": "Should we be geo-engineering the oceans?",
            "text": "Much of our planet is covered by oceans, which protect us from the worst ravages of global heating. Water and air are constantly exchanging carbon dioxide, and the seas around us have absorbed about a third of the CO2 we’ve pumped into the air, as well as the bulk of the warming it has caused. This has come at a huge cost to marine ecosystems. Carbon dioxide makes seawater more acidic, so it’s harder for sea creatures to grow shells, while the heat bleaches corals and destroys breeding grounds for fish and marine mammals. Warmer waters also absorb less CO2. Now a clutch of startups are trying to open up new avenues to remove even more carbon dioxide from our atmosphere by tapping into the ocean’s natural carbon cycles. Proponents say finding ways to increase the carbon sink at the depths of the ocean, where it can be stored for millennia, and to extract carbon dioxide from surface water offer opportunities to remove CO2 at the scale required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. While the chemistry and modelling may stack up, these are nascent technologies. How can we be sure they’ll work in practice and won’t ultimately cause even more damage to the delicate ecosystems on which we rely? Some startups want to speed up the natural process by which biomass from land reaches the depths of the ocean. Israel-based Rewind plans to transport forest and agriculture residues to the bottom of the Black Sea. This is an ideal environment, the company says, because it lacks oxygen, so the residues will decompose only very slowly. U.S. startup Running Tide is designing \"carbon buoys\", combinations of biomass and alkaline minerals which could help reduce the acidity of ocean surface waters or provide a growth medium for macroalgae. Later these would be sunk to take carbon to the bottom of the ocean. However, such use of seaweed has caused concern amongst scientists, who call for rigorous investigationNew Tab \"of the wide-ranging direct and indirect potential side effects”. Another pathway is to speed up the natural weathering of rock that washes carbonate and bicarbonate minerals into the sea through adding alkaline minerals. So called ocean alkalinity enhancement decreases acidity, so encouraging the absorption of more CO2 from the atmosphere. Canadian startup and XPRIZE winner Planetary Technology likens it to giving the ocean an anti-acid, and indeed the principle is already used in aquaculture, if water is too acidic to nurture shellfish. David Keller, a scientist at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Germany, is coordinating a pan-European project to assess the feasibility of using the ocean to stabilise the climate. Experiments where an alkaline mineral is added to closed tanks floating out at sea suggest it’s safe to do field trials of ocean alkalinity enhancement. “There's some small transient effects, but so far, I haven't seen any showstoppers,” says Keller. However, he adds, there are upper limits because too much alkalinity can cause the release of CO2. Planetary Technology is planning a trial off Nova Scotia on Canada’s Atlantic coast later this year, having already conducted a limited one on the Cornwall coast, overseen by the UK’s Environment Agency. Here it added small amounts of the mineral brucite to treated wastewaterNew Tab and demonstrated the removal of CO2. The sea off the UK’s south-west is particularly attractive because the surface waters continually mix with the atmosphere as ocean currents take them on their journey around the UK and beyond, says co-founder Mike Kelland. But getting local buy-in is key. “Our goal is to use very small, very contained and incremental field trials, as a mechanism for co-design with communities of eventual deployments,” if the community authorises them. It’s held public meetings and is trying to ensure local people have all the information they need. We want to “engage in a substantial way, because if we operate from a place of the unknown, we don't make any progress collectively. There's no way to proceed, and it becomes a catch-22 around the world,” suggests Kelland. He estimates the technology could reach around 2 gigatons of removals at very low concentrations across the world’s coastlines, and cost less than $25 a metric ton. Other startups are taking a different approach, using electrochemistry to remove CO2 from seawater, and thus encourage more to be drawn down from the atmosphere. Captura, another XPRIZE winner, uses renewable energy and a series of membranes to convert carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater back into a gas, which is “pulled” out of the water to be sequestered. The water that flows back into the ocean is slightly more alkaline so will draw down more CO2 from the atmosphere. Chief executive Steve Oldham stresses that “there’s no input material, no waste material, and (Captura’s process) uses the characteristics of the ocean.” Oldham, a veteran of direct air capture with British Columbia-based Carbon Engineering, points out that by volume, the ocean holds 150 times more CO2 than the atmosphere, requiring less water to be processed for the same impact. But water is heavier so takes more energy to move. Co-locating Captura’s systems with desalination plants or harnessing ocean currents could cut energy needs. And using off-peak renewables to power the energy-intensive membrane step will also cut costs. He estimates energy consumption will be about 20-25% of DAC systems today. Technology developed at UCLA is being exploited by spin-out, Equatic, to both produce clean hydrogen and capture CO2 from air and seawater. In its process, electrolysis of seawater produces hydrogen and creates an alkaline and acid stream of water. In the alkaline stream, the dissolved carbon dioxide forms solid calcium carbonate which can be stored, used to make cement or put back into the sea, where it's already prevalent. Bubbling air through this (now CO2 depleted) seawater captures more CO2, which gets locked up for thousands of years as a bicarbonate. On the other side of the equation, the addition of olivine (one of the most common minerals on the planet) neutralises the acidic seawater. In turn it too should take up more CO2 from the atmosphere, when returned to the sea. The whole process takes place in a closed plant, so Equatic can precisely measure the quantities of calcium carbonate produced and CO2 captured from the air, says chief operating officer, Edward Sanders. Outside the plant, it will monitor for any impacts on the local environment. Removals from its two pilot plants in Los Angeles and Singapore have already been sold, including through Stripe. Its next plant – expected to be commissioned in Singapore in 2025 – will be 10 times larger, to capture around 4,000 tons of CO2 each year. Equatic has also announced an agreement with Boeing to remove 62,000 tons of CO2 and to deliver around 2,000 tons of clean hydrogen to make sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Sanders envisages that “co-ops of industries will form as carbon dioxide removals get to scale. We'll have localised solutions, so you can optimise and not have to pay a carbon bill for moving things around. And that's really exciting because you create jobs and new industries.” Siting a plant next to a steel mill, for example, could provide the hydrogen needed to decarbonise the steel production process. Sanders says Equatic has a route to below $100/ton CO2 in 2028 at the million ton scale, that doesn’t rely on selling the calcium carbonate produced. Another variation on the theme, and a similar price projection, comes from Ebb Carbon. The California startup has just begun demonstrating its 100-ton-a-year modular system at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). Alongside PNNL, it’s working with scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the University of Washington, to develop and improve on its methodology and to research impacts on nearby marine life. Ebb Carbon’s solution would take the water flowing out of a desalination plant or cooling water from a power plant and put it through a series of membranes to remove acidity, in the form of hydrochloric acid. The less acidic water that goes back into the sea will draw down atmospheric CO2, to be converted to bicarbonate ions and held in that form for thousands of years. At the PNNL site, the acid that’s been extracted will go to local sand and gravel operations to neutralise their alkaline wastewater. Longer term, says co-founder Ben Tarbell, it could enhance rock weathering, another CO2 removal strategy. Ebb’s modelling suggests there’s enough existing desalination and power-plant infrastructure to reach the two gigaton scale soon. The question is whether longer term, there will be enough infrastructure to go round all the carbon removal hopefuls. For now, the challenge is accurately measuring and verifying how much CO2 is being locked away, and that’s where Ebb’s emphasis is. “There's a lot of rigour, a lot of science behind the detailed measurements and modelling that enable us to say, with a high degree of certainty, how much CO2 is pulled out of the air,” says Tarbell. That monitoring, reporting and verification is going to be critical to provide faith in the removals companies hope to claim. Nor is it cheap, suggests GEOMAR’s Keller. “There are no standard approaches to do this. Everybody's trying to figure it out,” he adds. “It takes really great observational capabilities, really good modelling capabilities and data simulation. It's still all in play as to how we do this, and what's (going to be) good enough so you can do your carbon accounting and get paid for a carbon credit.” The industry will also have to move beyond the technical and economic feasibility of their processes to take account of communities. Keller adds: “When any of these approaches are going to be applied, it actually ends up being a very local thing. And then you have to figure out who lives there, what are the local resources, is there spare wind energy?” As the entrepreneurs press on with modelling and experiments, they argue there’s no choice but to recruit the ocean’s natural systems if we’re to limit further warming. Our carbon emissions are already destroying the marine biodiversity upon which we depend, so we have to try everything to prevent things getting far worse. Meanwhile, the rest of the world has to get on with cutting emissions – or none of these approaches will be enough.",

An Airbus spokesperson declined to comment on delivery planning, but said: \"We are in continuous dialogue with our customers. We are still operating in a complex environment.\" Airbus began the year with a 50% rise in January deliveries compared to the same month of last year, which had been depressed by parts shortages and industrial bottlenecks. But supplies of engines and other components remain relatively tight and shortages of aircraft that are needed to meet a recovery in demand could last for years, according to speakers at last week's Airline Economics conference in Dublin. Air Lease (AL.N)New Tab Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy told the conference that many Airbus and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab single-aisle aircraft were already running \"a year late, nine months late, eight months late.

            "text": "Aerospace suppliers are gearing up for a hiring spree in 2023 but could face stiff competition for skilled laborers, including from their top customers - planemakers Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab . The tight labor market is a key factor in the industry's supply-chain shortages, and could determine whether Boeing and Airbus meet near-term production goals, industry officials said. Executives at last week's Pacific Northwest Aerospace Alliance conference, a gathering of top suppliers, expressed concern about replacing workers who left through layoffs or attrition during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"We just had massive, massive hiring problems in 2021 and 2022,\" said Chris Celtruda, chief executive of Valence Surface Technologies, which provides metal finishing and specialty coating services to Boeing and Airbus. While staffing has \"definitely gotten better,\" Celtruda noted small companies in Washington state that make up Boeing's supply chain will have to compete with Boeing itself, which announced plans to hire 10,000 workers in 2023 and add a fourth 737 MAX line in Everett in mid-2024. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said in January that the planemaker's production rate would hinge on suppliers' ability to find trained labor. The workforce at Orion, a subassembly manufacturer that laid off half its workforce in 2020, grew by 17% in 2022 and it plans to expand by another 33% in 2023, CEO Jerry Chase said. That means adding 30 jobs \"while everybody else is trying to recruit people.\" But he also worries about hiring too soon, risking workers sitting around if supply-chain problems persist. Since the pandemic, the aerospace supply chain has been hobbled by shortages in castings and forgings — particularly for aircraft engines — as well as a recent scarcity in extrusions, or other molded parts that can have lead times of up to 80 weeks, said Kevin Michaels, managing director of consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory. “Labor is the root cause of all three (parts shortages), and these bottlenecks in turn are leading, not surprisingly, to reduced inventory,” Michaels said. Aircraft manufacturers have expressed concerns about poaching employees from its suppliers. Airbus human resource chief Thierry Baril said in December the company is monitoring recruitment to ensure its supply chain is not weakened. The company plans to hire 13,000 workers in 2023, with more than 9,000 jobs to be located in Europe. Despite efforts to retain employees, overall turnover in the aerospace industry still grew from 5.8% to 7.1% in 2022, as inflation prompted workers to seek higher-paid jobs, according to a studyNew Tab by the Aerospace Industries Association.",

Investigators plan to use sonar technology to search for the decades-old plane and recover cockpit voice and flight data recorders, the NTSB said in a statement. \"That information will be used to determine how and when the recorders could be recovered and then how and if the airplane will be salvaged,\" the agency said. The agency has recovered and examined a small amount of floating debris from the flight, it said. A Boeing spokesperson said the company's technical team was helping the NTSB investigation. The two crew members on Transair Flight 810 were injured after being forced to land in the Pacific Ocean early on Friday, the NTSB said. The agency did not disclose the extent of their injuries. The crew reported engine trouble and plans to turn back shortly after taking off at 1:33 a.m. local time from Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu. The plane was en route to the Hawaiian island of Maui. A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter, responding to reports of the downed plane, spotted a debris field and found one crew member clinging to the plane's tail roughly an hour after takeoff. Another survivor was found using packages as a flotation device. One crew member was taken to a hospital by helicopter and the other was rescued by boat. The NTSB said it is scheduling interviews with the flight's crew, as well as air traffic controllers and maintenance workers.",

            "text": "Boeing (BA.N)New Tab Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told Aviation Week in an interview that the planemaker could be forced to cancel the 737 Max 10 over potential regulatory issues. Boeing has a December deadline to win approval for the 737 MAX 10 - the largest member of its best-selling single-aisle airplane family. Otherwise, it must meet new cockpit alerting requirements under a 2020 law, unless Congress waives it. Calhoun's comments could put more pressure on Congress. \"If you go through the things we’ve been through, the debts that we’ve had to accumulate, our ability to respond, or willingness to see things through even a world without the -10 is not that threatening,\" Calhoun told Aviation Week, adding that he does not expect to cancel the 737 MAX 10 but said \"it’s just a risk.\" A Boeing spokeswoman confirmed the accuracy of Calhoun's quotes and reiterated the planemaker is \"working transparently with the (Federal Aviation Administration) to provide the information they need, and are committed to meeting their expectations and those of our customers to certify and deliver the 737-10.\" The 2022 deadline was mandated by Congress as part of broader regulatory reforms at the FAA after fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed 346 people. read more Boeing has more than 640 orders for MAX 10 planes from 17 airlines, Aviation Week said. In June 2021, United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab said it would order another 150 MAX 10s. In March, the FAA warned Boeing it may not win certification of the MAX 10 by the end of the year and asked the company to provide a \"mature certification schedule.\" Boeing declined to comment on its current certification schedule. Unlike other Boeing aircraft, the 737 lacks the Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System known as EICAS. Missing the deadline could require Boeing to revamp the jet's crew alerting system and mean separate pilot training. Calhoun told Aviation Week: \"I think our case is persuasive enough. ... This is a risk I’m willing to take. If I lose the fight, I lose the fight.\"",

Shares of the largest U.S. domestic airline dropped 3.4% before the bell. However, Southwest forecast \"solid profits\" in the current quarter on strong summer bookings and joined rivals in allaying fears of a slowdown in travel due to a worsening economic outlook. \"Demand for domestic air travel remains strong, thus far,\" said CEO Bob Jordan, at a time cost pressures due to high labor and fuel expenses weigh on the industry. The airline, one of Boeing's biggest MAX customers, said it expects 70 deliveries of the 737-8 jet this year instead of the planned 90 after the U.S. planemaker disclosed a manufacturing issue with some of the workhorse aircraft. Delay in MAX deliveries is expected to increase operating costs for airlines and limit their ability to meet travel demand, hitting revenue. Southwest revised annual capacity growth outlook to between 14% and 15%, from 15% to 16% forecast earlier. The company expects \"solid profits\" in the second quarter as well as the full year, but did not provide specific numbers. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expect an adjusted profit per share of $1.05 for the second quarter and $2.73 for 2023. Dallas, Texas-based Southwest also expects revenue per seat flown one mile to fall 8% to 11% in the quarter through June, partly due to a policy change that eliminated expiration dates on qualifying flight credits. It booked a pre-tax charge of $380 million and reported a loss of 27 cents per share for the first quarter, wider than analysts' average expectation of a loss of 23 cents per share, as per Refinitiv data. Revenue for the quarter through March rose about 22% to $5.71 billion, slightly below expectations of $5.73 billion.",

Depending on last-minute negotiations, a deal could be made public as early as Friday when the U.S. carrier reports its fourth-quarter earnings, they said. Airbus declined to comment. Delta said it does not comment on industry speculation. While the Atlanta-based carrier placed an order for 100 Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 737 MAX 10 jets in 2022, it has primarily been an Airbus customer. At the end of September the company had 65 Airbus A330 and 28 A350-900 wide-bodies, with commitments to purchase another 16 each. The twin-aisle jets are expected to help the company to grow its network in Asia-Pacific, which has lagged behind the U.S. and Europe in global travel demand recovery after the pandemic. However, U.S. airlines are betting on the region as the next source of high-margin revenue at a time of soaring costs. In the current quarter, Delta, United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab and American Airlines (AAL.O)New Tab are estimated to increase seats on their flights to the region by more than 70% from a year ago. Airlines are also scrambling to order new planes to renew existing fleets amid fears of a shortage in coming years. Airbus last year set an industry record for gross and net orders.",

Airlines must disable the gust suppression function within three months or before 75,000 total flight hours. The directive requires disconnecting connectors and capping and stowing wires attached to affected modules. The directive, which is effective immediately, covers 279 U.S. registered 777 airplanes of U.S. registry. The FAA said Boeing is \"currently developing a modification that will address the unsafe condition\", and once the change is approved the FAA could issue another rule. Boeing did not immediately comment. Last week, the FAA proposed another airworthiness directive to address potential electric discharge in the fuel tanks of Boeing 777 series planes if a lightning strike or an electrical short-circuit occurs.

The FAA said effective on May 8 Lirio Liu, who directs the FAA's International Affairs office, will become the new executive director of its Aircraft Certification Service replacing Earl Lawrence, who is moving to a new role at the FAA. The move comes days after FAA Administrator Steve Dickson stepped down and Billy Nolen, the FAA’s aviation safety chief, was named acting administrator effective April 1. There have been a number of other personnel changes recently at the FAA. On Wednesday, the National Business Aviation Administration said it was naming the FAA's acting aviation safety chief Chris Rocheleau as its new chief operating officer. Rocheleau had been named acting aviation safety chief on April 1. Congress approved dramatic reforms to how the FAA certifies new airplanes after two fatal Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 737 MAX crashes in five months killed 346 people and led to the plane's 20-month-grounding. Dickson told Congress last year the FAA is delegating fewer responsibilities to Boeing for aircraft certification and the FAA is reviewing a number of issues involving Boeing. The legislation requires disclosure of critical safety information and providing new whistleblower protections. Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said the FAA reform law \"was a clear course correction. It said that we needed to have stronger FAA oversight, the people in place to do that job, and to hold manufacturers accountable.\" The FAA has warned Boeing that it may not be able to win certification for the Boeing 737 MAX 10 variant by December. House Transportation Committee chair Peter DeFazio on Wednesday noted the MAX 10 does \"not have an advanced flight crew alerting system\" that became an industry standard in 1982 and is on every current Airbus and Boeing model in production except for the 737s. DeFazio noted the \"aircraft certification bill gave the FAA a two-year grace period to certify aircraft without the advanced flight crew alerting system, but that grace period should not be extended.\" Boeing said it continues to work with the FAA \"to provide the information they need and remain committed to meeting their expectations regarding 737-10 certification.\"",

The NTSB is investigating seven runway incursion events since January, including the San Diego incident. Citing ATC staffing issues, the FAA this month agreed to extend temporary cuts to minimum flight requirements at congested New York City-area airports and Washington National Airport through Oct. 28. The Transportation Department Office of Inspector General (OIG) said in June critical ATC facilities face significant staffing challenges, warning of the risks posed to the continuity of air traffic operations. The FAA said on Thursday it currently has 10,700 certified controllers, up slightly from 10,578 in 2022, according to the OIG report, which was virtually the same as in 2021 and down 10% from 2012. The FAA closed its academy for six months in 2020 due to COVID-19 and paused on-the-job training at facilities for almost two years, the agency said. Managers told auditors that ATC facilities are not adequately staffed and many do not have enough supervisors. At several facilities, controllers are working mandatory overtime and six-day work weeks to cover staff shortages, the report found. Of the FAA's total 13,300 controllers, 26% are trainees, the report said. Last summer, there were 41,498 flights from New York airports where ATC staffing was a contributing factor in delays. The report found New York Terminal Radar Approach Control staffing was at 54% compared with optimal levels.",

            "text": "After a decade in the shadows, one of Europe's mystery aerospace projects - the X9 helicopter - is taking shape as a potential future successor to Airbus Helicopters' H145 light-twin chopper, with plans for a demonstrator underway, industry sources said. The X9 was one of two coded projects briefly sketched out by former helicopters chief Lutz Bertling in 2012 alongside the X6 SuperPuma replacement, which was later abandoned as low oil and gas prices at the time hit a key prospective customer base. Since then, little further has been said about the market for the X9 sister project - or even whether it still exists. A Berlin filing by Airbus Helicopters' German subsidiary in 2020 noted its board had been briefed on the X9 and unspecified \"further steps\". The same unit later said it would focus on ensuring \"the future viability of civil helicopters\" at Donauwoerth, Germany. The Bavarian town is home to the twin-engined H135 and H145, while other civil programmes focus mainly on Marignane, France, where the world's largest commercial helicopter maker is based. With sales still booming, Airbus has so far been content to upgrade the H145, which has its roots in a 1990s German-Japanese project and whose latest version adds an extra blade. In private, however, Airbus is exploring a potential H145 successor under the X9 codename and is ready to take the idea one step beyond the drawing board by seeking propulsion and other options for a planned demonstrator, the sources said. A demonstrator is a one-off test bench designed to test technology, which may or may not lead to a specific product. But the plans indicate where Airbus is focusing its attention. The X9 also has a programme office in Donauwoerth, according to a LinkedIn post. Even so, with the upgraded H145 still in demand, any launch decision remains some way off, the sources said. It can take 7-10 years and $1 billion to develop a new helicopter. In a statement to Reuters, Airbus did not respond directly to questions about the X9, but said: \"As market leaders, we are of course looking into the next generation of helicopters. \"We are currently working on several research and technology bricks that are aimed at making our aircraft more efficient while offering performance and mission flexibility.\" Not all studies become programmes, it said, adding: \"Currently our light twins are best sellers with over 65% of the civil and parapublic market.\" Airbus has built 1,600 of the various versions of H145 for medical, policing and other roles. It sold 83 H145s in 2022, second only to its best-selling light H125/130 \"Squirrel\". According to U.S. consulting firm Chase & Associates, H145 competitors include Leonardo's (LDOF.MI)New Tab AW169. Both aircraft will be at this week's Paris Airshow, with the H145 on the tarmac in its recently launched military version. Any future H145 successor would regenerate the German side of Airbus Helicopters, formed from a 1992 merger between divisions of France's Aerospatiale and MBB of Germany to counter U.S. rivals led by Bell, Boeing and Sikorsky. Spain joined later. Until 2014, the company was known as Eurocopter. Although it was the first part of what became Airbus to combine its fragmented national activities into one company, the helicopters unit was until recently seen as effectively split into French and German camps. Those barriers are gradually fading as Airbus Helicopters adopts a system under which specialised sites pre-assemble major sections, which then converge on one site for final assembly. The system was designed for jetliners and is working its way into helicopter plants, starting with the new H160 in Marignane. Airbus Germany has also begun producing parts for the once all-French H125/130, the industry's best-seller for which no replacement is immediately on the horizon.",

China has issued visas to American investigators and technical advisers to support its investigation into last week's deadly crash of a China Eastern Airlines (600115.SS)New Tab Boeing 737-800 in that country, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said on Tuesday. \"The team hopes to depart this week,\" the NTSB said in a tweet. In addition to NTSB investigators, China has issued visas to technical advisers from the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing Co. (BA.N)New Tab . It is still unclear whether the U.S. team will need to quarantine in China under its COVID-19 protocols, the NTSB said, adding that the issue is still under discussion. China has been experiencing a surge in coronavirus cases. The plane crashed into a mountainside in southern China on March 21, killing all 132 people onboard, in mainland China's deadliest aviation disaster in 28 years. Recovery crews on Sunday found the second black box - the flight data recorder - in the wreckage. The NTSB has been in regular contact with the Civil Aviation Administration of China since the crash. Under an international agreement, the NTSB has the right to participate since the plane was designed and built in the United States. FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told reporters on Tuesday he was encouraged by indications that China is following its obligations under that treaty. \"We're ready to go,\" Dickson said, but added: \"We're not over yet -- so that needs to happen.\" He noted there were ongoing discussions between China and the United States about outstanding issues including China's COVID-19 protocols. Jet engine maker CFM is a joint venture between General Electric (GE.N)New Tab and France's Safran (SAF.PA)New Tab and is a technical adviser to the NTSB as part of the investigation. However, representatives from CFM will not travel to China, the U.S. agency said, after saying earlier that they were planning to go.",

            "text": "U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is drafting an executive order intended to streamline approval for private rocket launches amid a broader effort to bring legal and regulatory clarity for American companies on everything from space travel to private space stations, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the effort. The order would be part of a push by the White House's National Space Council to modernize U.S. space regulation, which has failed to keep up with the increasingly ambitious pace of private-sector investment and development. The order, slated to be ready for Biden to sign by early 2023, is meant to simplify licensing procedures under existing laws for more routine space activities like launching rockets and deploying satellites, said one of the sources, who asked not to be named. The order will task the U.S. Department of Commerce with creating an online tool to help guide companies through various agencies' licensing processes for space-related activities, one of the sources said. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, who chairs the National Space Council, has signaled her intention to codify new rules for private space activities, but the plan for the executive order has not been reported. A spokeswoman for Harris did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While past administrations have made little progress revamping U.S. space laws, the Biden administration's broader effort to spur new rules, in addition to those targeted in the executive order, comes with greater urgency because of the pace of private investment in space. NASA also is pushing to privatize much of its low-Earth orbit activities. Companies like Elon Musk's SpaceX, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, Boeing and many more are expected to invest billions of dollars in the next decade in projects including private space stations, service satellites and spaceships in orbit. A team of U.S. officials drafting the executive order is also studying ways to spur congressional action that would give certain federal agencies the role of authorizing and supervising those space ventures, one of the sources said. The executive order is considered an early step to simplify existing regulations before new rules take shape. Companies like Blue Origin, Axiom Space and others are developing private space stations with unclear procedures for how they can court foreign governments as customers or execute their missions in space. Other unregulated areas include asteroid mining, for which startup AstroForge has announced plans, and clearing orbital debris, which companies like Astroscale want to tackle. Current U.S. regulations targeted in the order cover space-related activities on Earth, such as the Federal Aviation Administration's oversight of launch site safety and the Federal Communications Commission's allocation of satellite spectrum. However, a lack of rules governing private in-space activities complicates space companies' ties with prospective customers, investors and insurers that need more legal certainty. \"It's basically ... a lawless place,\" John Logsdon, founder of George Washington University's space policy institute, said of space. NASA hopes to land humans on the moon before the end of the decade under its Artemis program, which involves dozens of companies including SpaceX. Companies are increasingly stepping in for other countries. Private space stations like Orbital Reef, which Blue Origin is developing with Boeing and Sierra Space, could be deployed by 2030. Those stations would replace the International Space Station, an aging orbital science lab managed by a group of governments including the United States, Russia and the European Space Agency. In that new world, government space powers will become customers and are expected to provide early critical funding, industry executives said. How the parties will interact remains unclear. \"I have to have a conducive regulatory environment,\" Blue Origin senior vice president Brent Sherwood said in an interview in September. White House officials have held several \"listening sessions\" with space companies since Nov. 14 to discuss what rules the space industry would like to see, according to people familiar with the meetings. The Biden administration's push to update space regulations is crucial for keeping the U.S. in line with international law. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty requires countries to supervise the cosmic activities of their companies and largely makes governments responsible for those entities' space behavior.",

            "text": "(This Nov. 17 story, corrects target date for 65/mth to 2023 from 2025 in paragraph 4) A slew of plane orders at this week's Dubai Airshow has added weight to Airbus' hopes of raising output, but the jetmaker is not yet ready to pull the trigger, its top executive said. Airbus SE (AIR.PA)New Tab bagged 265 firm orders at the Middle East event, closing a gap with Boeing (BA.N)New Tab which had been leading this year as sales of its 737 MAX rebound from a safety crisis. A further 139 provisional orders lifted Airbus' Dubai tally above 400 jets, while Boeing won a firm order for 72 MAX. CEO Guillaume Faury said Airbus had definitively agreed to increase production to 65 single-aisle jets a month by summer 2023, from a planned average of 45 this quarter. Beyond that, Airbus has asked suppliers to explore rates of 70 in early 2024 and 75 by 2025, but has not made a decision. Some suppliers have criticised the plans, worried the pandemic recovery will remain patchy. \"We are in the phase of assessing demand,\" Faury told Reuters in an interview this week. \"What happened (in Dubai) is important, because together with other prospects or deals to come, it gives substance and ... evidence that the demand we see for rate 70, 75 will be sustained for many years.\" That \"inside-out\" view of demand - based on orders Airbus is receiving and its own assumptions based on talks with airlines - matches the \"outside-in\" or top-down picture provided by new Airbus market forecasts published at the show, he said. The forecasts cover 20 years and straddle categories, so cannot easily be used to gauge near-term output of a specific model. But Faury said the latest report was consistent with demand for \"maybe 70, 75\" A320-family jets a month this decade. \"So if those simulation tools and those sensors continue to be as robust as they have demonstrated in the past, we think 70, 75 is reasonable, but we're not yet there,\" Faury said. Industry sources say Airbus intends to take a decision by the middle of next year to leave time for suppliers to react. Faury said he had received encouraging signals during recent talks with French and German supplier groups. Privately, some suppliers are less optimistic. \"I think most still believe it will be bumpy,\" a senior industry source said. Airbus deliveries have flattened in the past three months, in part due to snags in the supply chain. Faury said the overall burden on the supply chain had eased, however, because of a drop in demand for wide-body jets. He declined to be drawn on a recent row with engine makers who oppose plans to raise monthly A320-family output beyond 65 in order to leave space for repair revenues on older planes that might otherwise be pushed into early retirement. Faury said he respected their concerns, as well as those of lessors, and any decisions would be made \"as a community\". Airbus appears worried disputes over output plans will deter suppliers from making investments needed to reach the first step of 65 a month, roughly where output was pre-pandemic. \"We are going to 65: that is decided ... We are executing this. But we have not decided anything beyond,\" Faury said.",

The multibillion-dollar deal eclipses Air India's combined purchase of 470 jets earlier this year as India's two largest carriers plan for a sharp expansion in regional travel demand. IndiGo's order for A320neo-family jets follows months of negotiations first reported by Reuters. Industry sources said in advance of the Le Bourget event that a 500-plane deal was close. \"This is just the beginning, there's more going forward. With the growth of India (and) the growth of the Indian aviation market ... this is the right time for us to place this order,\" IndiGo Chief Executive Pieter Elbers told a news conference. The aircraft will be delivered between 2030 and 2035. Efforts by Indian carriers to keep pace with the world's fastest-growing aviation market, serving the largest population, have sent industry records tumbling even though manufacturers are struggling to meet output goals. Indian carriers now have the second-largest order book, with an over 6% share of the industry backlog, behind only the United States, according to a June 1 report by Barclays. But some analysts have expressed concern that airlines could be over-ordering jets in pursuit of the same passengers. After signing the IndiGo deal, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said it was premature to start thinking about narrowbody jet production rates higher than the planned 75 per month. Airbus has faced problems in rebuilding production after the pandemic and has pushed back the mid-decade target to 2026, but Faury said supply disruption was a relatively short-term issue compared with the delivery schedules starting next decade. Airbus has said it is considering developing a successor to the A320neo between 2035 and 2040, meaning IndiGo is likely to have negotiated the option to switch to any new model or cancel late deliveries rather than be leapfrogged, analysts said. IndiGo, which accounts for nearly 60% of the Indian domestic market, is keeping Airbus as its supplier of single-aisle jets to squeeze out further economies of scale. But it has not yet decided which engine supplier to use for the latest order. It switched supplier from Pratt & Whitney (RTX.N)New Tab to GE-Safran (GE.N)New Tab (SAF.PA)New Tab venture CFM International about four years ago following issues with engines' durability. IndiGo still has almost 480 jets left in the Airbus pipeline from previous orders. Elbers said the latest order would allow the airline to double in size. IndiGo continues to hold separate talks with Airbus and rival Boeing (BA.N)New Tab for 25 widebody planes, which could either be Airbus A330neos or Boeing 787 jets, sources have said. Elbers declined to comment on any further plane orders.",

            "text": "A half century after the end of NASA's Apollo era, the U.S. space agency's long-anticipated bid to return astronauts to the moon's surface remains at least three years away, with much of the necessary hardware still on the drawing board. But NASA aims to take a giant leap in its renewed lunar ambitions with the debut launch set for next Monday in Florida of its next-generation megarocket, the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion crew capsule it is designed to carry. The combined SLS-Orion spacecraft is due for blastoff from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, sending the uncrewed capsule around the moon and back to Earth on a six-week test flight called Artemis I. \"We are go for launch,\" NASA Associate Administrator Bob Cabana, a former space shuttle pilot and commander, told a news briefing late on Monday following the mission's flight readiness review. The journey is intended to put the SLS vehicle, considered the world's most complex and powerful rocketship, through a rigorous stress test of its systems during an actual flight before it is deemed ready to carry astronauts. The SLS represents the biggest new vertical launch system NASA has built since the Saturn V rockets flown during its Apollo moon program of the 1960s and 1970s. More than a decade in development with years of delays and billions of dollars in cost overruns, the SLS-Orion spacecraft so far has cost NASA at least $37 billion, including design, construction, testing and ground facilities. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson has called the Artemis program an \"economic engine,\" noting that in 2019 alone, for example, it generated $14 billion in commerce and supported 70,000 American jobs. Congress has steadily increased NASA's budget to include funds for Artemis. Among the greatest financial beneficiaries are the principal SLS and Orion contractors - Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N)New Tab , respectively. NASA's Artemis program, named for the goddess who was Apollo's twin sister in ancient Greek mythology, aims to return astronauts to the moon as early as 2025 and establish a long-term lunar colony as a steppingstone to even-more-ambitious future voyages sending people to Mars. read more \"Even with this delay and increased budget, it is doubtful that NASA will be landing humans on the moon by 2025, but if all goes well, it could happen in the next few years,\" Lori Garver, who served as NASA's deputy administrator during the rocket's conception, told Reuters. Twelve astronauts walked on the moon during six Apollo missions from 1969 to 1972, the only spaceflights yet to place people on the lunar surface. All of those explored regions around the lunar equator. NASA last Friday announced 13 potential landing zones around the lunar south pole where it plans to send its new generation of explorers, including the first woman and first person of color to set foot on the moon. A successful SLS-Orion launch is a crucial first step. The towering spacecraft, 322 feet (98 meters) tall, was slowly trundled to Launch Pad 39B last week following weeks of final preparations and ground tests. Barring last-minute technical glitches or unfavorable weather, the four main SLS engines and its solid-rocket boosters are set to ignite at 8:33 a.m. EDT (1233 GMT) on Monday, sending the spacecraft streaking skyward. Should the countdown be delayed beyond the two-hour window targeted for liftoff, NASA has set Sept. 2 and Sept. 5 as alternative launch dates. Following separation from the rocket's upper stage more than 2,300 miles (3,700 km) from Earth, Orion's thrusters are due to fire to set the capsule on its outbound course, bringing it as close as about 60 miles (100 km) from the lunar surface before traveling roughly 40,000 miles (64,400 km) beyond the moon and back to Earth. The capsule is due for an Oct. 10 Pacific Ocean splashdown. Orion will be carrying a simulated crew of three - one male and two female mannequins fitted with sensors to measure radiation levels that a real-life crew would encounter. If successful, Artemis I would pave the way to a first crewed SLS-Orion mission, an out-and-back flight around the moon designated Artemis II, as early as 2024, followed a year or more later by an Artemis III trip to the lunar surface. Artemis III will be much more complex, integrating the SLS-Orion with spacecraft to be built and flown by entrepreneur Elon Musk's company SpaceX. Those include SpaceX's heavy-duty Starship launch and lunar-landing vehicle, still under development, and components still to be constructed including an orbital fuel depot and space tankers. Even the new moon-walking suits remain to be designed. The plan would be for a four-person Orion crew to dock in space with a SpaceX lander to ferry two astronauts to the moon's surface for nearly a week.",

            "text": "Indonesia has lifted a ban on the Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 737 MAX, its transport ministry said on Tuesday, three years after the crash of one of the aircraft operated by domestic carrier Lion Air with the loss of all 189 people on board. Aviation authorities around the world grounded the aircraft months later after a similarly deadly accident in March 2019 involving one of the aircraft operated by Ethiopian Airlines. The approval for the aircraft's return in Indonesia comes months after it returned to service in the United States and Europe, and follows more recent lifting of grounding orders in countries including Australia, Japan, India, Malaysia, Singapore and Ethiopia. The lifting of the ban was effective immediately and it follows the evaluation of changes to the aircraft's system by regulators, the ministry said in a statement. Airlines must follow airworthiness directives and inspect their planes before they can fly the 737 MAX again, it said, adding that the government would also inspect the planes. Privately owned Lion Air, which operated 10 of the 737 MAX planes before the ban, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. National flag carrier Garuda Indonesia (GIAA.JK)New Tab said it had no plans to reintroduce the plane to its fleet as it focuses on debt restructuring, chief executive Irfan Setiaputra told Reuters. The state-controlled airline, which had operated one 737 MAX before the ban, has said it plans to cut its fleet from 142 to 66 planes under the plan. Anton Sahadi, a relative of one of the passengers on board the Lion Air plane that crashed, urged the government to ensure proper management of the risks before returning the aircraft to service \"so that no planes of this model will ever fall and kill people again\". \"The trauma is still there,\" he said.",

            "text": "Boeing (BA.N)New Tab Co. Chief Executive Dave Calhoun will not receive a $7 million bonus due to the company's failure to enter the 777X into service by the end of 2023, Boeing said Friday. Boeing offered the performance-based incentive to Calhoun when he replaced former CEO Dennis Muilenburg in January 2020 and required that Calhoun achieve seven milestones by the end of this year. Boeing's compensation committee determined in August 2022 that the award would not vest when it became clear that Calhoun would not meet the 777X entry into service goal by 2023, according to a company filing posted on Friday afternoon ahead of an April 18 shareholder meeting. Calhoun took home $7 million in pay last year, slightly less than his $7.4 million compensation in 2021, Boeing stated in the filing. His total compensation, which includes longterm incentives that have not yet vested, measured $22.5 million in 2022, an increase from about $21 million the previous year. In 2022, Boeing confirmed that first delivery of the widebody 777X had slipped to 2025, most recently because of a setback in the aircraft certification timeline. The aircraft, also known as the 777-9, is a larger version of the original 777 aircraft and has been in development since 2013. Boeing's board of directors said Calhoun \"substantially achieved, or is on track to substantially achieve\" most of the award's performance goals, which include the return to service of the 737 MAX in 2020. The board also praised Calhoun's leadership in the filing, saying the CEO made several decisions on the 777X program that were in the company's long term interests but came at the expense of the goal being met. In February, Boeing awarded Calhoun an incentive worth approximately $5.3 million - made in restricted stock units that vest in 2024 and 2025 - in order to induce the CEO to stay through the company's projected recovery period. While the company pointed to the 777X program as the reason Calhoun will not receive his bonus, other milestones associated with the incentive have yet to be successfully completed, such as the first crewed Starliner launch currently projected for April. The terms of the award also called for Calhoun to meet certain milestones on the Boeing-Embraer joint venture, which dissolved in 2020.",

            "text": "Trade power tensions, regulatory hurdles and attempts by the West to counter Chinese competition are delaying a return of the 737 MAX in China, frustrating Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab as a potential rival demonstrates its growing influence. Six months after the West lifted an almost two-year flight ban on the MAX, there is no clear end in sight for the crisis surrounding Boeing's fastest-selling jet in China - the first nation to ground it in 2019 after two deadly crashes in five months. The company had hoped for China to approve the MAX to return to the sky by the end of last year; in January 2021, Boeing said it expected the MAX to be approved by regulators everywhere by the end of June. Now, with help from the Biden administration, Boeing is stepping up efforts to convince China the plane is safe and reset its most strategic partnership as airlines start to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. But people familiar with the discussions say regulatory and political obstacles mean any resolution is still months away. For Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun, that means seeing profits and market share slip to European rival Airbus SE (AIR.PA)New Tab . read more \"I do know that if it goes on for too long, I pay a price,\" he told a Bernstein conference this month. \"I pay a price because they're (China) the biggest part of the growth of the industry in the world.\" Because of the China uncertainty, Boeing is not confident it can raise production beyond the 31 MAX planes per month level it expects to hit by early 2022, Calhoun said. The company has been all but shut out of new orders in the world's biggest aircraft market since 2017, which contributed to its decision to cut production of its long-haul 787 model. read more China hopes to compete against Western planemakers, including with its C919, a direct rival to the MAX and other narrowbodies such as the Airbus A320. Its manufacturer, state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) is aiming for local certification of the C919 by year end, and is ultimately seeking Western certification. That potential competition has prompted the United States and Europe to call a truce in a 17-year aircraft trade war so they can focus on challenging Chinese subsidies. read more Group of Seven leaders last week scolded China over a range of issues and demanded a thorough probe of the origins of COVID-19, angering Beijing. read more Any improvement in the political backdrop to the MAX decision seems unlikely before the Communist Party's 100th anniversary on July 1, sources and analysts say. \"The 100th anniversary of the founding of the party, the 20th Party Congress next year, the (2022 Winter) Olympics - all of those push China to be less cooperative,\" said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at Center for Strategic and International Studies. PRACTICAL PROBLEMS The MAX grounding - after crashes that killed 346 people - has been worst crisis in Boeing's history. Design flaws led to multiple investigations, damaged its reputation worldwide and left it short of cash needed to cope with the COVID-19 crisis. Yet a year ago, the prospects of China returning the MAX to service on a timeline similar to that of the United States and Europe seemed good. But politics, practical problems such as visa and quarantine issues, and the Chinese aviation regulator's intense scrutiny have gradually sapped U.S. hopes of a quick solution, industry sources say. Last year, engineers from Seattle visited China to answer Civil Aviation Administration of China's (CAAC) technical queries, one of the people said. Once it was clear CAAC's timeline lagged that of other regulators, Boeing suggested China send representatives to Seattle to observe test flights, two people said, but CAAC declined as the pandemic raged in the United States. Discussions shifted to having Boeing's engineers and pilots travel to Beijing for test flights, but six months later that hasn't happened, the first person said. Boeing said it continued to work closely with CAAC and other regulators to return the MAX to service worldwide but declined to respond to specific questions from Reuters. CAAC declined to comment about the timeline for approval or the considerations for granting it. But CAAC chief Feng Zhenglin late last year raised concerns about Boeing's pilot training and after-market services in a small group meeting, a third source familiar with the matter said. The source, like others in this article, declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. CAUTIOUS REGULATOR The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was also cautious about the MAX's return to service and slapped down efforts by Boeing to speed up the process; Europe's aviation regulator delayed approvals by months. CAAC, however, is known in the industry as the most conservative of the world's major aviation regulators. China has not had a deadly commercial air crash in more than a decade. CAAC was the first regulator to ground the MAX. It has since issued three requirements for the return to service of the MAX in China: certified design changes, sufficient pilot training, and definitive findings from the crash investigations. read more Beijing has big long-term regulatory ambitions, according to a State Council blueprint. It aims for China to become a global aviation power by 2050, giving the regulator greater international influence. CAAC's most recent jet aircraft certification was with the domestically manufactured regional jet ARJ21, whose production is ramping up after five years in service. It has not been certified by any Western regulator. In the past, the Chinese regulator would have simply ticked certification boxes under bilateral agreements, a source at a Western aerospace supplier said. But now, as Beijing pins its aviation hopes on the C919, it is asking for detailed and sometimes proprietary data, analyses and presentations. \"CAAC... have put on their big boy pants,\" the source said. \"Now what they're doing in the industry is saying, 'We do not trust traditional certification authorities anymore. We want to learn ourselves what you guys have been doing for the past 50, 60, 70 years.'\"",

            "title": "Russia explores buying stranded jets from Western leasing firms",
            "text": "Russian airlines have held exploratory talks with at least one major Western leasing firm about using state funds to buy some of the more than 400 aircraft stranded in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, according to documents and sources. The proposal, which would need EU approval and test the scope for compromise in an economic war between Moscow and the West, could lower a multibillion-dollar bill facing lessors and insurers and allow Russian airlines to secure formal ownership of planes at a potentially steep discount. A Russian aviation source said the proposal was still being discussed, but that some Russian officials were pessimistic about it getting European Union approval. An EU official familiar with discussions on the issue declined to comment. Before what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, Russia was a major market for aircraft lessors, who bought jets from Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and leased them to Russian airlines who wanted to avoid the up-front cost and inflexibility of buying planes themselves. But after Western sanctions forced lessors to cancel these contracts, Moscow refused to allow the planes to leave, stranding almost $10 billion worth of aircraft in Russia and triggering claims by lessors against their own insurers. Russian airlines continue to operate many of the jets, but some have struggled to secure replacement parts. Details of talks between Russian airlines and one lessor emerged in an Irish court case where major lessors are suing insurers, including Lloyd's of London (SOLYD.UL), to ensure payment of their claims. AerCap (AER.N)New Tab , SMBC Aviation Capital and Avolon, the world's largest lessors, declined to comment on whether they were involved in talks on payment for jets from Russian airlines or their insurers. EU sanctions, which cover Ireland where the majority of leased aircraft are registered, banned the supply of aviation technology to Russian entities and set a deadline of March 28 to terminate contracts. There has been no suggestion that any of the lessors, who operate in a highly regulated sector, have infringed sanctions in any way, with industry figures saying they were exploring all options in an unprecedented situation. Russian state backing for the talks was demonstrated in an Aug. 30 letter from its Transport Ministry to 23 airlines. \"On the purchase of aircraft of foreign lessors, please submit information ... on each aircraft that it is proposed be bought out using the resources of the National Wealth Fund,\" the letter said. It also asked for \"information on the ... existence of agreement with lessors and insurance companies on a plan for the repurchase of the aircraft\". The ministry did not respond to a request for comment. World No. 2 lessor SMBC said in a Sept. 15 letter released to the Irish High Court that it had spoken to Aeroflot (AFLT.MM)New Tab and Aeroflot's insurer AlfaStrakhovanie. \"AlfaStrakhovanie advised that it had been approached by Aeroflot to explore the possibility of making ex-gratia payments .... to SMBC AC in settlement of the insurance claims,\" said the letter, a copy of which was made available to Reuters and other media by the court. The payment would be \"in return for the transfer of ownership of the aircraft to the Russian insurer or its nominee,\" the letter, which was first reported by Irish publication The Currency, added. SMBC, which took an impairment of $1.6 billion for 34 jets, said in the letter that on Sept. 2 AlfaStrakhovanie offered it $644.2 million for 17 aircraft leased to Aeroflot, minus $82 million already paid in deposits and reserves. That was \"considerably less than the aggregate Agreed Values\" for the aircraft, SMBC said in the letter. SMBC also said in the letter that it had been approached by Elbrus Insurance Brokers LLC on behalf of Russian airline NordStar and, separately, by airline S7 to discuss \"potential claim solutions.\" Aeroflot, AlfaStrakhovanie, Elbrus, NordStar and S7 did not respond to requests for comment. SMBC in its letter said it was involved in lobbying the EU to facilitate a deal, specifically a derogation from Article 3C of Regulation 833/2014. Such a derogation \"would enable EU operating lessors to seek authorisation to transfer ownership of aircraft formerly leased to Russian lessees or their Russian insurers,\" it said. Lessors could argue agreement would boost safety by allowing access to spare parts, said Ross Denton, head of international trade at law firm Ashurst. But one Western finance official said any deal would face major legal and diplomatic hurdles and talks may be premature. \"Right now, it would be such a flagrant contravention of sanctions - why would governments all of a sudden agree to this?\" the senior official said on condition of anonymity.",

            "text": "Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N)New Tab on Wednesday unveiled an agreement with Boeing (BA.N)New Tab under which the beleaguered supplier will receive immediate funding from the planemaker and revised prices for 737 and 787 production, sending its shares up 23%. Spirit, one of the industry's major manufacturers of large aircraft structures, has struggled with cash flow problems over the past few quarters and quality issues surrounding the fuselages it makes for Boeing's 737 narrowbody jets. Under the agreement announced on Wednesday, Spirit will get a higher price for near-term deliveries of the forward fuselage and other components it makes for 787 Dreamliner, while 737 unit prices will be cut from 2026 to 2033. As a result, Spirit is expected to record $455 million of extra sales between 2023 and 2025. Spirit's revenues from 2026 to 2033 are projected to decrease by $265 million. Boeing has agreed to extend repayments on $180 million of financing from 2025 to 2027. The planemaker will also provide an extra $100 million in the next 10 days for tooling needed for future 787 and 737 production rate increases. The agreement addresses concerns laid out by former Spirit CEO Tom Gentile, who said in September that the company's contracts with Boeing and Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab were \"not sustainable\" due to inflationary pressures that contributed to $215 million in losses over the first half of 2023. Airbus declined to comment on whether it is engaged in similar contractual discussions with Spirit. While providing financial relief for Spirit, the new agreement includes a \"control clause\" requiring Boeing's input if Spirit were to be acquired. That \"seems to suggest that Boeing is going to have some sort of pseudo-management control over big, strategic decisions that Spirit may make, particularly with regard to change of control, should that theoretically occur,\" Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said. Overall, the agreement should stabilize Spirit and pave the way for a future agreement with Airbus, he added. Boeing said the agreement \"will enhance operational stability in our production system and help us deliver on our customer commitments.\" Spirit CEO Patrick Shanahan said in a statement that the companies will continue to focus \"on further generating supply chain performance and resiliency.\" Quality woes related to 737 fuselages continue to weigh on Spirit as it forecast third-quarter revenue between $1.43 billion and $1.45 billion, below analysts' average expectation of $1.53 billion, according to LSEG data. Spirit shares closed up at $21.16. Boeing closed flat at $185.69.",

Meanwhile, U.S. futures , pointed to gains for Wall Street, with investors still in a chipper mood after Tuesday's forecast-beating results from Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O)New Tab and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)New Tab . \"We have good U.S. data in earnings which is very reassuring but valuation is very stretched in both the value as well as the growth sector,\" said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management. \"And people are also getting a bit hesitant and are a bit worried because the amount of money that is going through will slow down with the Fed slowly starting to taper - but that is not necessarily a bad thing.\" Earnings reports from Ford (F.N)New Tab , Coca-Cola (KO.N)New Tab , McDonald's (MCD.N)New Tab and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab are due later in the day. Concern over more tension between Beijing and Washington weighed on markets too, after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted to revoke the authorization for China Telecom's (0728.HK)New Tab U.S. subsidiary to operate in the United States after nearly two decades, citing national security. read more Currency and bond traders were looking to a slew of central bank meetings over the coming week for guidance. Canada is first up later on Wednesday at 1400 GMT while the European Central Bank meets on Thursday, when Bank of Japan also concludes its two-day meeting. No changes are expected from Tokyo, but traders are expecting the ECB to push back on market inflation forecasts and are looking for hawkish clues from the Bank of Canada as prices put pressure on rates. read more Policymakers are facing a steady drip of evidence that there is no let-up from pressure on consumer prices. The latest came from Australia, where data showed core inflation hit a six-year high last quarter, raising the possibility of sooner-than-planned rate increases. read more The Australian dollar jumped after the data but soon pared the gains. The ebbing risk sentiment meanwhile pushed up the safe-haven Japanese yen which rose 0.4% against the U.S. dollar though the greenback in turn held just off a one-week high versus a currency basket. In fixed income markets, focus was on U.S. short-term Treasury yields which rose above 0.5% for the first time in 19 months. That caused the Treasury yield curve to flatten, as the possible timing of the Fed's first interest rate rise came into tighter focus. The Fed has all but confirmed it will soon start to whittle back its asset purchases, though has said that shouldn't signal that rate hikes are imminent. Nevertheless, Fed funds futures are priced for a lift-off in the second half of next year. \"We updated our Fed call to show a hike in Q4 2022 and four hikes in 2023,\" analysts at NatWest said in a note. \"The inflation overshoot has been persistent,\" they said. \"There is (only) so much the Fed can tolerate before reacting ... it feels inevitable that that conversation will be brought up more and more as we go into next year.\" Traders are also watching for the half-yearly update on UK public finances and economic outlook from the finance minister, who is expected to set out tighter budget plans and put Britain on course to become the first big economy to undergo a two-pronged withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimulus. read more",

            "text": "The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Tuesday said it would perform final inspections on new Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 787 Dreamliner aircraft, and will not allow the planemaker to self-certify the jets. The U.S. aviation regulator said it notified Boeing of the decision that it will retain the authority to issue airworthiness certificates until it is confident \"Boeing’s quality control and manufacturing processes consistently produce 787s that meet FAA design standards.\" Boeing said it \"will continue to work transparently through (the FAA's) detailed and rigorous processes... We will continue to engage with the FAA to ensure we meet their expectations and all applicable requirements.\" Boeing suspended deliveries of the 787 in late May after the FAA raised concerns about its proposed inspection method. The FAA had issued two airworthiness directives to address production issues for in-service airplanes and identified a new issue in July. Deliveries have remained halted as U.S. regulators reviewed repairs and inspections. Deliveries are expected to remain frozen months longer. The FAA said it wants Boeing to ensure it \"has a robust plan for the re-work that it must perform on a large volume of new 787s in storage\" and that \"Boeing’s delivery processes are stable.\" House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chair Peter DeFazio praised the FAA for \"taking much-needed steps to ensure the safety of the flying public.\" He noted the committee has been investigating the production and manufacture of the 787. The 787 program remains at a low production rate, with an expected gradual return to five per month over time, Boeing said. Boeing disclosed a $3.5 billion charge due to delivery delays and customer concessions, and another $1 billion in abnormal production costs, related to production flaws and related repairs and inspections on the advanced composite jet. The FAA previously retained the right to issue certifications for the first four Boeing 787s when the company briefly resumed deliveries in early 2021. Boeing shares rose 3.7% on Tuesday. Factory changes and other requirements to overcome tiny structural blemishes have raised longer-term questions over Boeing's ability to build 787s at a sufficiently low cost and at the rates once planned, a person familiar with the matter said.",

            "text": "Boeing (BA.N)New Tab executives will face hard questions from investors about whether a recent labor deal reached by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N)New Tab could raise aircraft production costs when the U.S. planemaker releases its second-quarter financial results on Wednesday. Spirit, which produces part of the fuselage of every Boeing passenger jet, reached an agreement with its machinists union on June 29, a week after employees at its Wichita, Kansas-based headquarters voted to strike. Operations fully resumed on July 5. Analysts said they will seek answers about whether the agreement, which boosts wages by at least 23.5% over four years, could also result in raised prices for Boeing. \"What (the strike at) Spirit actually told us is what's happened to the cost of skilled touch labor - which is that it has just gone through the roof,\" said Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst at Agency Partners. Aircraft producers are typically able to shield themselves from inflation through contractual escalation clauses that pass rising costs to airlines. However, those clauses have ceilings, and Spirit -- which expects to burn cash in 2023 -- may not be financially capable of absorbing higher labor costs, said AeroDynamic Advisories analyst Richard Aboulafia. \"What are you going to do, say, 'You'll have to cut your profit margins?' They don't have profit margins,\" Aboulafia said. Investors will also seek details about whether the two-week work stoppage delayed production of Boeing's bestselling 737. Bank of America analyst Ron Epstein wrote in a July 12 note that 13% of the 49 narrowbody 737s delivered in June came from Boeing's inventory compared to 5% in April and May - potentially signifying a slowdown of fuselages from Spirit. Problems at Spirit have rattled Boeing's aircraft production and deliveries several times in 2023. A data analysis error by the aerostructures manufacturer forced Boeing to halt deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner for several weeks earlier this year, and Boeing continues to rework 737 narrowbody planes where Spirit incorrectly installed two brackets. Boeing's defense business will also come under the microscope after the indefinitely delayed the first crewed launch of its Starliner spacecraft in June. Boeing Defense CEO Ted Colbert told reporters later that month that performance of the company's defense unit will look similar to the first quarter, when margins at the company were negative due in part to a charge on the KC-46 program. \"It's just another quarter where things should have got better by now, but they haven't,\" Cunningham said.",

            "text": "Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab said on Friday it would set up a facility in India to convert 737 passenger planes into dedicated freighters to tap into regional and global demand for the service. The investment, which adds to the U.S. manufacturer's expansion into India on top of a record plane order by flag carrier Air India, comes despite a global economic slowdown that has weakened the global air cargo market. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said global cargo demand in January fell almost 15% year-on-year. Air freight rates are 28% below the levels seen at the same time last year, data provider WorldACD said on Thursday. But in India growing e-commerce demand and manufacturing of smart phones and other electronics for domestic use and export is strengthening the outlook for freighters, Salil Gupte, Boeing's India president told reporters in New Delhi. Gupte said there was demand to convert more than 1,700 passenger planes globally into freighters over the next 20 years, with about 600 coming from Asia. \"So it is only fitting that we have the capability to have a line to make those freighters here in India, not just for India, but for the region and for the world,\" he said. Boeing with partner GMR Aero Technic, an Indian maintenance, repair and overhaul provider, will over the next 18 months set up the facility in Hyderabad to convert old passenger planes into freighters. The deal adds to Boeing's $1 billion supply chain sourcing from India and will help support India's ambitions to become a global cargo hub, Chief Strategy Officer Marc Allen told reporters in New Delhi. He did provide any details about when the facility would be set up or the size of the investment. The planned facility comes amid a push by Boeing to expand in India, including a $24 million investment to set up a logistics centre for aircraft parts. The slump in travel triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a record-breaking scramble to convert older passenger jets into freighters. But analysts say that aircraft lessors could now be stuck with excess freighters, or be forced to cancel conversions, as cargo rates fall.",

Orders for long-distance widebody jets rebounded to meet international travel demands. Air Canada last month purchased 18 Dreamliners and Air France-KLM ordered 50 Airbus A350s. Since the pandemic, there has also been a rise in demand for narrowbody jets, especially larger models such as the A321, which has dominated the single-aisle market. Among U.S. airlines, higher-margin international travel is the most important to United, accounting for about 39% of its passenger revenue this year - up from before the pandemic. United Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella said the company expects a disproportionate part of its growth in the second half of this decade to come from global long-haul flying. \"In the future, United will increasingly turn to global growth to expand,\" he told reporters on a conference call. The latest order is the second major aircraft purchase by United over the past year. It unveiled a huge order of 100 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 100 737 MAXs in December. “United’s unprecedented commitment to the 787 Dreamliner family is a testament to the market-leading operating economics and reliability of Boeing’s widebody jets,” said Stan Deal, head of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said the A321's fuel efficiency, smaller carbon footprint and lower maintenance and operating costs will be a \"game changer\" for United. Carriers have been placing orders with urgency as Boeing and Airbus backlogs have grown and as jet deliveries have been pushed out toward the end of the decade. Nocella called the situation \"a bit frustrating\" as the planes ordered by the company are \"significantly\" behind schedule. Meanwhile, limitations on runways, airspace and gate capacity at the nation's largest airports have compelled airlines to cut departures. United aims to get around the problem by flying larger planes with more seats. It expects average seats per departure in North America to increase by 40% in 2027 from the pre-pandemic period. The large 787 order is likely to raise further questions about the future of outstanding United orders for 45 Airbus A350s which have already been deferred to at least 2030. Nocella said that while the A350 is a \"great machine\" and there is no change in the company's order, United is focused on its 787 fleet in the short run. It plans to deploy the 787 jets on the routes that Boeing's 767 is flying today, he said. \"It's doing great for United around the globe,\" he said. The latest order comes at a time when weakening pricing power in the U.S. market has sparked concerns about the strength of travel demand. Analysts are not sure consumers will continue to splurge on travel if the economy slips into a recession. Nocella downplayed those concerns. \"United's investors can have confidence we remain focused on achieving our long-term profit margin goals,\" he said.",

            "text": "A door panel that flew off a Boeing 737 MAX 9 jet mid-flight on Jan. 5 appeared to be missing four key bolts, according to a preliminary report from U.S. investigators that provided the first official look into how the frightening mishap took shape. Lawmakers and the flying public have demanded answers to what caused the panel to flyoff a brand-new Alaska Airlines-operated jet, in what has turned into a full-blown safety and reputational crisis for Boeing (BA.N)New Tab . \"Whatever final conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. An event like this must not happen on an airplane that leaves our factory,\" Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said in a statement. \"We simply must do better for our customers and their passengers.\" The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded 171 of the Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes after the incident, most operated by U.S. carriers United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab and Alaska Airlines (ALK.N)New Tab , for inspections. Those planes were cleared to return to service in late January and nearly all are flying again. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report released on Tuesday focused on how the panel - fitted into this MAX 9 model in place of an optional exit - could have detached from the plane. The plug is held down by four boltsNew Tab and then secured by \"stop fittings\" at 12 different locations along the side of the plug and the door frame. Representative Rick Larsen, the top Democrat on the committee overseeing the FAA, said the \"failure to re-install bolts on a safety-critical component of this 737 MAX 9 aircraft is a serious error that signals larger quality control lapses that must be corrected.\" The plug was manufactured by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N)New Tab , a former Boeing subsidiary. The part was produced at Spirit's facilities in Malaysia and delivered to its Wichita, Kansas, facility in May 2023. It arrived at Boeing's assembly plant in Renton, Washington on Aug. 31. The report shows the panel had to be removed at Boeing's factory before being reinstalled. The initial findings released on Tuesday include photo evidence the bolts required to hold the plug in place appeared to be missing. The report found the panel was first removed to repair rivet damage logged by Boeing workers on Sept. 1, a day after the panel arrived in Renton. Investigators are still trying to determine what documentation was used to authorize the opening and closing of the plug during the rivet repair. The report raises questions about who initially installed the bolts and why the door's opening at Renton to correct the rivets was not properly documented, said U.S. aviation safety expert John Cox. \"When was the last time those bolts were installed? Did Spirit not install them and then when Boeing opened it the guys didn't realize that they didn't have the bolts? Or did Boeing not install them? That is something that I don't think we have an answer for yet.\" Senator Tammy Duckworth, who chairs an aviation subcommittee, questioned the lack of paperwork about the removal or replacement of bolts. \"It is a series of problems,\" Duckworth said in an interview. \"What is going on between the maintenance and inspection teams... Holy cow - nobody noticed?\" Boeing said it had \"implemented a control plan to ensure all 737-9 mid-exit door plugs are installed according to specifications.\" The panel was found in a backyard in a suburb of Portland, Oregon, but the NTSB did not recover the bolts. The agency also did extensive tests and analysis to determine if they had been present before the crash or had come undone during the incident, it said. A photo in the report shows three visible locations where bolts are missing, with the fourth location covered by insulation. \"Photo documentation obtained from Boeing shows evidence of the left-hand MED plug closed with no retention hardware (bolts) in the three visible locations,\" the report said. MED is short for \"mid exit door.\" The incident has prompted regulators and lawmakers to ratchet up oversight of the jet manufacturer. The FAA in late January barred Boeing from expanding production of its 737 MAX planes due to the quality issues. That means it can continue producing MAX jets at its current rate, but it cannot increase that rate. \"I certainly agree that the current system is not working, because it's not delivering safe aircraft,\" FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker told lawmakers on Tuesday. \"So we have to make changes to that.\" Boeing's Calhoun bowed to lawmaker pressure to drop a request for a temporary exemption from design rules for a different MAX model, and more hearings in Washington will be held, Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell said on Tuesday. \"The NTSB's preliminary report on the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 accident underscores how important quality assurance is from manufacturers and how important quality control inspections from both manufacturers and the FAA are to the safety process,\" she said. The FAA is about halfway through a six-week audit of 737 MAX manufacturing, which is looking at all elements of production at Boeing and fuselage production at its supplier Spirit. Spirit will invest in autonomous technology to limit any defects in its production of 737 fuselages, CEO Patrick Shanahan said on Tuesday following the company's earnings. Boeing shares closed up 1% on Tuesday. The stock has lost more than 20% of its value since the beginning of the year. Spirit shares ended up 5%.",

            "text": "Tensions between India and Canada escalated after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday there were \"credible allegations\" linking Indian government agents to the June murder in Canada of a Sikh separatist leader campaigning for the creation of an independent Sikh homeland called \"Khalistan\". It wants an independent Sikh state carved out of India and dates back to India and Pakistan's independence in 1947 when the idea was pushed forward in negotiations preceding the partition of the Punjab region between the two new countries. The Sikh religion was founded in Punjab in the late 15th century and currently has about 25 million followers worldwide. Sikhs form a majority of Punjab's population but are a minority in India, comprising 2% of its population of 1.4 billion. Sikh separatists demand that their homeland Khalistan, meaning \"the land of the pure\", be created out of Punjab. The demand has resurfaced many times, most prominently during a violent insurgency in the 1970s and 1980s which paralysed Punjab for over a decade. The Khalistan movement is considered a security threat by the Indian government. The bloodiest episode in the conflict between the government and Sikh separatists occurred in 1984. Then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent the military into the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine for Sikhs, to evict armed separatist leader Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his supporters, which infuriated Sikhs around the world. A few months later, Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards at her home in New Delhi. The army launched operations in 1986 and 1988 to flush out Sikh militants from Punjab. Sikh militants were also blamed for the 1985 bombing of an Air India Boeing 747 flying from Canada to India in which all 329 people on board were killed off the Irish coast. The insurgency killed tens of thousands of people and Punjab still bears the scars of that violence. Although the Khalistan movement has little support now in India, it has small pockets of backing among sections of the Sikh diaspora in Canada, which has the largest population of Sikhs outside Punjab, and in Britain, Australia and the U.S. In April this year, India arrested a self-styled preacher and Sikh separatist Amritpal Singh for allegedly reviving calls for Khalistan, sparking fears of new violence in Punjab. Earlier this year, India hit out at Canada for allowing a float in a parade depicting the assassination of Indira Gandhi, perceiving this to be a glorification of Sikh separatist violence. India has also been upset about frequent demonstrations and vandalism by Sikh separatists and their supporters at Indian diplomatic missions in Canada, Britain, the U.S. and Australia, and has sought better security from local governments. Indian diplomats based in Canada have on numerous occasions said that Ottawa's failure to tackle \"Sikh extremism\", and the constant harassment of Indian diplomats and officials by Khalistanis, is a major foreign policy stress point. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised strong concerns about Sikh protests in Canada with Trudeau on the sidelines of a G20 summit in New Delhi this month. Canada has paused talks on a proposed trade treaty with India. Canadian Trade Minister Mary Ng is postponing a planned trade mission to India.",

Boeing first filed with the FCC in 2017 seeking approval to deploy a V-band Constellation using low earth orbit and highly inclined non-geostationary orbit satellites \"to provide high speed broadband communications.\" Boeing sought to operate V-band Constellation \"to provide broadband Internet and communications services to residential consumers, governmental, and professional users across the United States, Puerto Rico, and US Virgin Islands.\" In 2019, Elon Musk's SpaceX urged the FCC to reject Boeing's plan saying it presented a \"clear danger of harmful interference\" to other systems or \"at a minimum impose appropriate conditions to ensure that Boeing’s operations do not harm those of other\" operators. Boeing declined to comment on the FCC application circulated for a vote by Acting FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel on Thursday. In April, the FCC voted to approve a SpaceX plan to deploy some Starlink satellites at a lower earth orbit than planned as part of its push to offer space-based broadband internet. SpaceX had asked the FCC for approval to fly 2,824 satellites at a lower orbit as part of the plan to provide high-speed broadband internet services to people who currently lack access. The FCC also said SpaceX agreed to accept that their lower-altitude satellites may encounter interference from satellites deployed under Amazon's (AMZN.O)New Tab Kuiper Systems satellite project. In July, Amazon said it would invest more than $10 billion to build a network of 3,236 low-earth orbit satellites. read more SpaceX, which plans to eventually deploy 12,000 satellites in total, has said previously the Starlink constellation will cost it roughly $10 billion. While extremely costly to deploy, satellite technology can provide high-speed internet for people who live in rural or hard-to-serve places where fiber optic cables and cell towers do not reach. The technology could also be a critical backstop when hurricanes or other natural disasters disrupt communication.",

            "text": "Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab is still facing parts shortages as the supply chain remained unstable and unpredictable, its finance chief said on Wednesday. Boeing aims to increase production of its bestselling 737 MAX narrowbody jetliner from a stable rate of about 31 jets a month to 38 by the end of the year. The timeline for the ramp-up will hinge on whether MAX suppliers are stable and ready to support the higher rate, Chief Financial Officer Brian West said at a Cowen conference. \"The supply chain continues to have its moments of disruption,\" West said. Operations had improved at suppliers at the tier one level, or subassemblies and systems; visibility of constraints had improved at tier two, components; and tier three, parts, he said. \"We're just not there yet,\" West said. Deliveries of the MAX in February were expected to drop to the \"low 20s\" from 35 in January, West said, then ramp back up to allow Boeing to meet its goal of delivering 400-450 MAX planes this year. Boeing plans to boost MAX deliveries to 50 planes a month by the 2025-2026 timeframe, while at the same time creating a fourth production line in Everett, Washington. The line will initially focus on producing MAX jets with more complicated configurations, but West hinted it could also accommodate future demand beyond 50 planes per month. The 787 Dreamliner has also experienced production lags, including pauses in production due to supply chain delays at Spirit Aerosystems, which makes the forward fuselage, West said. \"Our expectation is that they will get back to that three per month, and then as we move through the course of this year, be exiting the year more closer to five per month,\" he said. Boeing intends to deliver all 100 787s in its inventory over the next two years, West said. He said the company had confidence in its 2023 cash flow goal of $3 billion to $5 billion.",

            "text": "Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N)New Tab has withdrawn from the U.S. Air Force's competition to build at least 75 refueling tankers, the company said, giving Boeing's (BA.N)New Tab KC-46 Pegasus a boost in the closely watched multibillion-dollar defense contract. Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab teamed up with Lockheed as the prime contractor in 2018 to offer its A330 multi-role tanker transport. Now the European aerospace company will continue to pursue the competition but without Lockheed, Airbus said late Monday. Lockheed's pullback gives Boeing a boost, greatly increasing the chance it will win the program despite years of costly mistakes with the existing fleet of KC-46 tankers. Based on current prices, the total order could equal around $12 billion, but is likely to be higher. The KC-46, however, has been plagued by defects, including problems with an on-board video system and a refueling boom that fails to connect the tanker to aircraft seeking refueling. These errors have cost Boeing $7 billion in losses. Shares of Boeing turned positive after Reuters first reported the Lockheed news, and were up 1.7%. An Airbus victory would land Airbus its first aircraft contract with the U.S. Air Force after attempting to penetrate the U.S. defense market for two decades. Monday's news also marks the second time Airbus had been dumped by a U.S. partner. Airbus, previously worked with Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N)New Tab to win a $35 billion contract in 2008 to build MRTT tankers for the U.S. Air Force. That effort was scuttled after a Boeing protest succeeded in opening the path for the KC-46. The Air Force, which aims to replace hundreds of Eisenhower-era KC-135 tankers in three lots, kicked off a competition in 2022 for its second tranche of as many as 160 jets on top of the 179 KC-46 Pegasus planes Boeing has begun to build. The U.S. later slashed the effort to 75. Lockheed said it would shift the tanker team and resources to other programs including \"aerial refueling solutions in support of the U.S. Air Force's Next-Generation Air-Refueling System (NGAS) initiative.\" NGAS is the final tranche of the current tanker replacement program. It is expected to be announced and completed in the 2030s. The abrupt departure of the Lockheed bid, known as LMXT, surprised some Capitol Hill aides. Advocacy for the LMXT, which would be made in Alabama and Georgia, had been extensive with Lockheed spending heavily to assure that Boeing's plane was not a shoo-in to win the second tranche. In 2011, Boeing won the first of the three-phase procurement to replace the Air Force's aging tanker fleet, securing a contract for 179 KC-46s.",

But shares in the company, which has been one of the top risers on the FTSE 100 index over the year to date with a 64% gain, were down 2% in early deals which one analyst said was due to disappointment over the lack of an upgrade to the outlook. Tufan Erginbilgic, who took over as chief executive in January, has said Rolls, which provides engines for Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 planes, is a \"burning platform\" which needs to improve its cash generation, cut debt and invest for the future. A strategic review he initiated is due to report in the second half of 2023, he confirmed on Thursday. What the company called its \"transformation\" was already keeping costs down and finding savings, it said, highlighting the closure of its R2 Factory venture, an artificial intelligence start-up, as an example. A further boost from savings is expected as the year goes on, it said. It was also seeing improved pricing in its power systems business, whose equipment is used in ships, mining and heavy industry. In its civil aerospace unit, the biggest part of the business, Rolls-Royce said flying hours reached 83% of pre-pandemic levels in the four months to April 30, meaning rising revenues from more air travel as airlines pay it on an hours flown basis. \"If current trends continue, we believe the group could point to the higher-end of the range with first-half results,\" said Jefferies analysts.

McKenzie did not provide details on timing or how many F-15 aircraft, made by Boeing (BA.N)New Tab , would be provided. Last month, McKenzie emphasized \"very robust\" military assistance to Egypt as he flew into Cairo in the wake of a decision by President Joe Biden administration's to cut $130 million in military aid to the country over human rights concerns. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a former Army chief, has been criticized for crushing dissent since coming to power after leading the 2013 ouster of elected President Mohamed Mursi of the now-banned Islamist party, the Muslim Brotherhood. U.S. officials have said the American relationship with Egypt is complex. The most-populous Arab country is a vital ally and key voice in the Arab world. U.S. military officials have long stressed Egypt's role expediting the passage of U.S. warships through the Suez Canal and granting overflight for American military aircraft.",

The Commerce Department's Census Bureau said on Wednesday that orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, dropped 5.4% last month, also weighed down by declines in bookings for civilian aircraft. Data for September was revised lower to show orders for these goods rising 4.0% instead of the previously reported 4.6%. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast durable goods orders would decline 3.1%. Durable goods orders rose 4.0% on a year-over-year basis in October. Manufacturing, which makes up 11.1% of the economy, is shuffling along as higher interest rates cool demand. Since March 2022, the U.S. central bank has raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% range. Transportation equipment orders plunged 14.8% last month after increasing 11.6% in September. Motor vehicle and parts orders fell 3.8%, likely because of shortages caused by the UAW's strikes at a number of U.S. factories owned by General Motors (GM.N)New Tab , Ford (F.N)New Tab and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI)New Tab . The industrial action has since ended. Civilian aircraft orders tumbled 49.6%. Boeing (BA.N)New Tab reported on its website that it had received 123 orders for civilian aircraft, compared to 224 in September. There were increases in orders for computers and electronic products as well as fabricated metal products. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell. Machinery orders were unchanged. Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dipped 0.1% after slipping by a downwardly revised 0.2% in the prior month. These so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have risen 0.5% in September. Core capital goods shipments were unchanged for a second straight month. Shipments of non-defense capital goods dropped 0.3% following a 0.2% decline in the prior month. These shipments feed into the calculation of equipment spending in the gross domestic product report. Business spending on equipment spending contracted in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 4.9% annualized rate last quarter.",

The U.S. planemaker last month pushed back first delivery of the world's largest twin-engined jetliner by more than a year to 2025, five years after it was originally due. The cargo version is a recent expansion of the delayed jet project. read more Asked if he saw risks to the future of the 777X programme as a result of cumulative delays, Air Lease Corp (AL.N)New Tab Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy, told financiers, \"yes.\" Pressed on whether it was possible the whole programme could be cancelled, Udvar-Hazy, widely seen as the father of the modern leasing industry, said that would depend on what the Boeing board looks like in 18 to 24 months. \"What I'm saying is that those decisions whether to continue with the programme or not, it will probably not be made by this board of directors anyway,\" Udvar-Hazy told the Airline Economics conference in Dublin. A Boeing spokesperson referred to comments last month by Chief Executive Dave Calhoun, who said, \"We've got to give ourselves the time and freedom to get this right.\" Boeing has also said it is highly confident in the 777X family. Udvar-Hazy's warning came days after the head of Dublin-based lessor Avolon told a different Dublin event hosted by Airfinance Journal that Boeing had \"lost its way\" after a barrage of problems and may need new management. read more . But the head of the world's largest lessor, AerCap Holdings (AER.N)New Tab , threw his weight behind Boeing on Monday, saying the U.S. manufacturer would \"bounce back.\" read more Plans to update the 777 mini-jumbo with a larger 400-seat version have been hit by certification problems, while regulatory issues have frozen deliveries of the smaller 787. Boeing won a respite from the woes affecting its core widebody programmes on Monday when Lufthansa said it would buy 10 cargo planes including seven of the 777X version, also known as 777-8F. The carrier also boosted its order for Boeing 787s as part of a compensation deal for delays to the 777X passenger version. read more It is also a major customer for the Airbus A350. Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said the deal highlighted the cost to Boeing of concessions to offset recent delays. Udvar-Hazy said Air Lease had considered buying the recently announced freighter version of the 777X but had decided not to do so because there were \"too many questions and delays.\" Air Lease became a launch customer in November for an Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab A350 Freighter, though Boeing leads in the order race for the two models after deals with Qatar Airways and now Lufthansa. Despite Monday's order, the freezing of 787 deliveries remains a major sore point for airlines and leasing firms and a significant drain on cash for Boeing. \"I have never seen anything like (it),\" Udvar-Hazy said, noting airlines can cancel airplanes once they are a year late. Air Lease Chief Executive John Plueger said one airline had filed such a cancellation for a Boeing 787 in the past week. Turning to delays at Airbus, Plueger did not rule out further delays to the new A321XLR single-aisle model after the European firm announced a three-month delay last week. He said the delay could stretch to six or nine months, but was unlikely to reach a year or two. Airbus wants to rely on the housing of the plane's engines to absorb some impact in the event of a belly crash landing. But regulators are insisting on strengthening its redesigned fuel tanks to absorb the full impact and prevent fire, Plueger said. Engineers have said such work could take several months.",

JAL confirmed it was involved in talks to buy new jets but declined further comment. \"We are still at the stage of negotiation, so we cannot provide details,\" a JAL spokesperson said when asked about an earlier Bloomberg report on the deal. The order will likely be a combination of 737 MAX 8 jets and some of Boeing's larger 737 MAX 10 planes, the reportNew Tab said, adding the airline was also in talks with Airbus SE (AIR.PA)New Tab . Boeing declined comment on any commercial discussions. Airbus said it never comments on talks with customers. A deal for JAL to buy Boeing's single-aisle MAX would be the second by one of Japan's top carriers following All Nippon Airways (ANA) (9202.T)New Tab , in a national market traditionally dominated by Boeing. The future of the MAX in Japan had been uncertain after a recent safety crisis and the pandemic, which delayed ANA's decision to finalize its own order by around two years. Analysts say Boeing was stung when Airbus unexpectedly sold its A350 wide-body jet to JAL 10 years ago in the wake of a crisis over battery problems on the competing Boeing 787, for which Japan is both a major supplier and customer. But although Airbus has made inroads for its single-aisle A320 at ANA's low-cost Peach unit, and JAL's Jetstar Japan flies leased A320s, ensuring a foothold for the MAX in the mainline fleet of the national carrier was seen as a priority for Boeing. Global airlines association IATA says the domestic market in Japan has rebounded strongly since the pandemic, but outbound travel has been penalized by the weakening of the Japanese yen.",

            "text": "Supply chain shortages and wage inflation are at the top of a list of concerns for aerospace companies attending a depleted Singapore Airshow amid tight health controls this week. Across aerospace, the suppliers that feed Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab factories are facing an acute shortage of skilled workers and weakened balance sheets after back-to-back crises triggered by a 737 MAX safety grounding and the COVID-19 air travel slump. A shortage of vital materials, from titanium to microchips, is worrying procurement executives, coming on top of existing fears over available stocks of steel and aluminium. Those factors - compounding a decade of pressure from Boeing and Airbus to cut prices - are fuelling doubts about the supply chain's ability to meet aggressive narrowbody production ramp-up plans this year and beyond, particularly at Europe's Airbus. \"Wherever I look in the supply chain, I see problems,\" Gary Lowe, Chief Executive of Thyssenkrupp Aerospace North America, told a U.S. supplier conference on the eve of the air show. Referring to increases in production planned by Airbus and Boeing, he said, \"I think it's going to be a lot more lumpy and problematic than people realise.\" A labour shortage is likely to fuel inflation as firms try and lure back workers who left the industry during the pandemic, while staffing up to meet demand. The aviation recovery has been swifter than expected, particularly in the narrowbody market, Kailash Krishnaswamy, senior vice president of aftermarket services at Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N)New Tab , said on the sidelines of the Singapore Airshow on Tuesday. \"When you have cut down labour by 20% to 50%, ramping up that steep... it's just very challenging getting people back. And when you don't have people back, you don't have parts,\" he added. And many analysts say the maximum point of vulnerability is when suppliers have to invest in inventory or new equipment to respond to demand coming out of the crisis, rather than during the low point of demand when furlough schemes softened the pain. \"Some of these supply chain guys have been stretched in terms of their balance sheets, cash flows, significant investment into plant and material prior to pandemic. So I am worried about their financial health,\" Domhnal Slattery, chief executive of aircraft lessor Avolon said in Singapore. Lowe urged suppliers across the industry to be transparent about what they need and avoid stockpiling materials. After months in which the aerospace industry broadly shrugged off the impact of the semiconductor shortage, aviation is beginning to feel pressure. Planemakers can still find supplies of the high-value, low-volume chips used for flight controls and avionics - whose designs are relatively old compared with the lightning pace of change in the consumer products world. But supplies of chips for more common uses such as aircraft seat electronics are beginning to dry up, a senior procurement source said. Eric Bernardini, global co-head of aerospace, defence and aviation at U.S. consultants AlixPartners, said the problem is more visible in the supply base of Airbus than Boeing. That is because Airbus is pushing ahead faster than its rival despite reservations from its engine suppliers, while delays in the 787 Dreamliner and a gradual recovery in the 737 MAX have left parts of Boeing's supply base with excess inventory. On Monday, executives from both companies said they were aware of supply chain risks and were factoring them into their planning. To offset cost pressure, suppliers in the United States are moving some production from states with high labour costs such as California, Bernardini said. He said the Omicron coronavirus variant has also taken a toll on assembly lines as COVID-19 infections left suppliers short-staffed. In some cases, the variant had put 25% of the workforce out of circulation. \"This is very disruptive,\" Bernardini said. \"The productivity has decreased.\"",

            "text": "Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab told employees on Monday that it will add a new 737 MAX production line in Everett, Washington, in mid-2024 as it plans to ramp up deliveries of its best-selling plane. Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Stan Deal said in an email reviewed by Reuters that the new line will be its fourth for the narrow-body 737 MAX and is needed because of \"strong product demand.\" The company is reactivating its third 737 MAX line in Renton, Washington, Deal added. Boeing booked nearly 700 MAX orders last year, delivered 387 737s and has a total backlog of about 3,600 MAX airplanes. \"In addition to preparing the facility, we have begun the process of notifying and preparing our suppliers, customers, unions and employees as we take the necessary steps to create a new line,\" Deal said. The move comes as demand for wide-body jets that were previously built in Everett has been under pressure, despite a partial recovery. It was disclosed on the eve of the final delivery of the iconic 747 from the plant. The 737 line will take the place of some remaining activity on the 787, a modern wide-body jet whose production has been concentrated at another Boeing plant in South Carolina. Boeing said this month it had stabilized 737 production at 31 per month, with plans to ramp production up to approximately 50 per month in the 2025-2026 timeframe. Deal referred to a decision of Congress in December to lift a deadline imposing a new safety standard for modern cockpit alerts for two new versions of the 737 MAX aircraft. The planemaker had been heavily lobbying for months to persuade lawmakers to waive the deadline covering the MAX 7 and MAX 10 airplanes, imposed by Congress in 2020 after two 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Boeing had said the fate of the two new planes was in jeopardy without action from Congress. Deal's email cited the support of unions for the waiver, including the International Association of Machinists (IAM). Earlier this month, IAM International President Robert Martinez said the union \"relentlessly fought for this extension that will ensure the livelihoods of thousands of machinists in the aerospace sector.\" The legislation requires Boeing to fit new safety enhancements to the MAX 7 and MAX 10 and retrofit existing MAX 8 and MAX 9 planes in the fleet. Boeing said the costs of the retrofits will be \"small.\" Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said this month the company thinks \"first delivery for the 7 will be this year and probably for the 10 the next year.\" Airline executives including United Chief Executive Scott Kirby and employee unions had raised concerns that a failure of Congress to act would have impacted U.S. jobs at Boeing. Officials have credited airline unions with helping convince Congress to approve the waiver over the objection of some relatives of those killed in the 737 MAX crashes.",

            "text": "Major international airlines rushedNew Tab to rejig or cancel flights to the United States ahead of a 5G wireless rollout on Wednesday that has triggered safety concerns, despite wireless carriers saying they will delay parts of the deployment. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had warned that potential 5G interference could affect altitude readings on some jets, with airlines citing the Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 777 among the models in the spotlight. Despite an announcement by AT&T and Verizon that they would pause the 5G rolloutNew Tab near airports, several airlines still cancelled flights or switched aircraft models. Here is the background to the dispute: WHAT HAPPENED? The United States auctioned mid-range 5G bandwidth to mobile phone companies in early 2021 in the 3.7-3.98 GHz range on the spectrum known as C band, for about $80 billion. The FAA warned that the new 5G technology could interfere with instruments such as altimeters, which measure how far above the ground an airplane is travelling. Altimeters operate in the 4.2-4.4 GHz range and the concern is that the auctioned frequencies sit too close to this range. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said last month the FAA's 5G directives would bar the use of radio altimeters at about 40 of the biggest U.S. airports. U.S. airlines have warned the directives could disrupt up to 4% of daily flights. Kirby said if left unresolved it could mean that at major U.S. airports in the event of bad weather, cloud cover or even heavy smog \"you could only do visual approaches essentially.\" WHAT AIRCRAFT ARE AFFECTED? Airlines announced plans to switch away from Boeing 777 and Boeing 747-8 aircraft, including Emirates, All Nippon Airways (ANA), Japan Airlines (9201.T)New Tab and Lufthansa (LHAG.DE)New Tab . In the short-term, AT&T and Verizon agreed to temporarily defer turning on some wireless towers near key airports to avert a significant disruption to U.S. flights. read more Longer-term, the FAA needs to clear and allow the vast majority of the U.S. commercial airplane fleet to perform low-visibility landings at many airports where 5G C-band will be deployed. This means certifying altimeters to operate near 5G base stations. The higher the frequency in the spectrum, the faster the service. So in order to get full value from 5G, operators want to operate at higher frequencies. Some of the C band spectrum auctioned had been used for satellite radio but the transition to 5G means there will be much more traffic. Verizon and AT&T have argued that C band 5G has been deployed in about 40 other countries without aviation interference issues. They have agreed to buffer zones around 50 airports in the United States, similar to those used in France, for six months to reduce interference risks. The European Union in 2019 set standards for mid-range 5G frequencies in a 3.4-3.8 GHz range, a lower frequency than the service set to be rolled out in the United States. The bandwidth has been auctioned in Europe and is in use in many of the bloc's 27 member states so far without issue. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which oversees 31 states, said on Dec. 17 the issue was specific to U.S. airspace. \"At this stage, no risk of unsafe interference has been identified in Europe,\" it said. FAA officials have noted the spectrum used by France (3.6-3.8 GHz) sits further away from the spectrum (4.2-4.4 GHz) used for altimeters in the United States and France's power level for 5G is much lower than what is authorized in the United States. Verizon has said it will not use spectrum that is closer to the higher band for several years. In South Korea, the 5G mobile communication frequency is 3.42-3.7 GHz band and there has been no report of interference with radio wave since commercialization of 5G in April 2019. Currently, 5G mobile communication wireless stations are in operation near airports, but there have been no reports of problems. \"Wireless carriers in nearly 40 countries throughout Europe and Asia now use the C band for 5G, with no reported effects on radio altimeters that operate in the same internationally designated 4.2-4.4 GHz band,\" CTIA, a U.S. wireless trade group, said in a filing with the Federal Communications Commission.",

            "text": "Major U.S. airlines and aviation companies joined ethanol companies to send a letter to the Biden administration on Wednesday backing a regulatory change that would make it easier for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from corn-based ethanol to qualify for federal subsidies. The Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden's signature climate law, requires SAF producers to use an emissions model developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), or a \"similar methodology\", to show their fuel cuts emissions over gasoline by 50% to secure the subsidies. Airlines including Delta (DAL.N)New Tab , JetBlue (JBLU.O)New Tab , and Southwest (LUV.N)New Tab , and companies like GE Aerospace (GE.N)New Tab and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab , said in the letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that the administration should allow the use of the Department of Energy's Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET) model in addition to the one developed by ICAO, echoing a request from the ethanol industry. The ethanol industry believes the GREET model is more likely than the ICAO model to bear out the required climate benefits to secure IRA subsidies. Environmental groups argue, however, that the GREET model underestimates ethanol's emissions, particularly those associated with clearing land to grow the crops required to make ethanol. \"With the right market signals, we can de-carbonize aviation and spur a new wave of U.S. innovation and clean energy jobs. However, modeling uncertainty today is a multiyear development problem,\" said the letter, which was also signed by ethanol companies including Poet and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co (ADM.N)New Tab . The letter comes the same day Biden and his administration kick off a two-week focus on rural America, starting with a visit to Minnesota on Wednesday. The final decision on the modeling question sits with Treasury, though the agriculture, environment and energy departments have also weighed in and the White House has stepped in to mediate, according to prior Reuters reporting. The USDA said in September that it updating the GREET model to ensure that ethanol is eligible as an SAF feedstock. A decision from Treasury is expected in December, according to prior Reuters reporting.",

            "text": "Philippine budget airline Cebu Pacific (CEB.PS)New Tab will decide in May or June whether to choose Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab or Boeing (BA.N)New Tab for an order of more than 100 narrowbody aircraft flagged last year, the carrier's CEO Michael Szucs said. Cebu Pacific is deciding whether to choose a combination of Airbus' (AIR.PA)New Tab A320neo and A321neo models or Boeing's high-capacity 737 MAX 8-200 and 737 MAX 10 for delivery from 2027, he said in an interview on the sidelines of the Singapore Airshow. It will be a significant market test for Boeing following the latest in a series of crises when in January a mid-air cabin panel blew out on a MAX 9 jet mid-flight. Cebu Pacific needs a mix of shorter and longer plane models to cope with the Philippines' varied runway types. It currently has an all-Airbus narrowbody fleet that includes A320neos and A321neos, meaning a switch to Boeing would be a major win for the U.S. planemaker. Szucs said Boeing was fully communicating with Cebu Pacific and he had every confidence it would solve the problem that led to the panel blowout. The carrier said in October it was looking to order 100 to 150 narrowbody aircraft worth up to $12 billion at list prices in what could be the Philippines' largest-ever jet purchase. Cebu Pacific has said it aims to more than double its fleet by 2035 to take advantage of a long-term travel boom across Southeast Asia following the pandemic. The deal is likely to be 100 firm orders plus some options for more purchases, Szucs added, with the decision taking into account its engine preferences. RTX (RTX.N)New Tab subsidiary Pratt & Whitney's GTF engines, which are used on some A320neo jets, are subject to an inspection drive to check for potentially flawed components that have forced airlines to temporary ground planes and cancel flights. Ten Cebu Pacific A320neo family jets are currently grounded awaiting these engine inspections, and the engine problem will cause issues for the carrier for the next few years, Szucs said. But he said he was confident Pratt & Whitney would have resolved the issue by 2027 when Cebu Pacific hopes to start receiving the new planes. The airline said on Tuesday it had chosen Pratt & Whitney engines to power 15 A320neo family aircraft currently on order. CFM International, a joint venture between GE (GE.N)New Tab and Safran (SAF.PA)New Tab , offers a rival A320neo family engine option and is the sole provider for the 737 MAX.",

Regulators have stepped up scrutiny on Boeing after a Jan. 5 mid-air panel blowout on an eight-week-old Alaska Airlines MAX 9 jet (ALK.N)New Tab that left a gaping hole in the aircraft. Boeing has sought to contain the damage, appointing an independent advisor to examine quality control in its manufacturing processes while numerous planes remain grounded. The FAA grounded 171 Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes after the Jan. 5 incident. In its new \"Safety Alert for Operators,\" the FAA said that some airlines had conducted additional inspections on the 737-900ER mid-exit door plugs and had noted \"findings with bolts during the maintenance inspections.\" The 737-900ER is more widely used than the 737 MAX 9. It is an older model but has the same optional door plug design that allows for the addition of an extra emergency exit door when carriers opt to install more seats. There are 490 Boeing 737-900ER jets in service, at least 79 of which have an active door rather than the plug because they are operated by low-cost airlines with denser cabins, according to Cirium data. The FAA recommended that carriers perform key portions of a fuselage plug assembly maintenance procedure related to the four bolts used to secure the door plug to the airframe \"as soon as possible.\" A Boeing spokesperson said: \"We fully support the FAA and our customers in this action.\" Boeing first delivered the 737-900ER in 2007 and the last one in 2019. Boeing (BA.N)New Tab shares were down 0.8% in morning trading on Monday. They are down more than 17% since the beginning of the year. Alaska Airlines and United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab , the only two U.S. carriers that use the MAX 9, this month said they had found loose parts on multiple grounded MAX 9 aircraft during preliminary checks. They have had to cancel thousands of flights this month because of the grounding, with United cancellations extending at least through Friday. Alaska did not immediately comment on how long it planned to extend cancellations. The FAA on Sunday said MAX 9 planes will remain grounded until it \"is satisfied they are safe to return to service.\" In contrast to the new MAX 9 that experienced the door-plug issue, Boeing 737-900ER aircraft have more than 11 million hours of operation and 3.9 million flight cycles, and the FAA said the door plug \"has not been an issue with this model.\" Both United and Alaska said they had begun inspections of the door plugs on their 737-900ER fleets. United, which has 136 737-900ER aircraft, said inspections should be completed in the next few days without customer disruptions. Alaska said its inspections began several days ago without any findings so far. Delta Air Lines (DAL.N)New Tab , the largest operator of the 900ER, said it had opted to take \"proactive measures\" to inspect its fleet. It does not expect any operational impact. Globally, the three U.S. carriers operate the vast majority of the 737-900ERs with the door plugs. A spokesperson for Korean Air, which has six 737-900ERs, said it planned to carry out additional inspections and finish them within 30 days without any schedule disruption. The FAA on Wednesday said inspections of an initial group of 40 Boeing 737 MAX 9 jets had been completed, a key hurdle to ending the grounding of the model. The FAA is continuing to review data from those inspections. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker told Reuters this month that the FAA was \"going through a process to work out how to restore confidence in the integrity of these plug doors.\" National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy last week said that the investigative agency would be looking at numerous records related to the door plug. She said it was unclear if the bolts on the Alaska Airlines jet were properly secured or if they were actually installed at all.",

Boeing said on Tuesday that it expects airlines in Europe to order 7,100 new single-aisle planes, usually used for short haul trips, between now and 2040, with low-cost specialists like Ryanair (RYA.I)New Tab behind that demand. In fact, Europe's demand for planes will be even more strongly driven by low-cost carriers than elsewhere in the world, said Boeing vice president, commercial marketing Darren Hulst. \"Globally our forecast in general is about 40% of single aisle demand is low-cost carrier, and I would say you could argue in this European space that number would be slightly higher,\" he told a press briefing. In the widebody or long-haul sector, Boeing is expecting demand for 1,545 new jets in Europe over the 20-year period. Of the 7,100 new single aisle jets, where Boeing's 737 jets compete against Airbus's A320 and A321s, Hulst is expecting demand for close to 3,000 to come in the next ten years. Many traditional carriers like British Airways-owner IAG (ICAG.L)New Tab and Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA)New Tab also operate their own low-cost brands, such as Vueling and Transavia respectively.

Beyond upgrading its fleet, Aeromexico needs to implement technology that further reduces unit costs, so it can better compete with local low-cost carriers Volaris (VOLARA.MX)New Tab and Viva Aerobus, and its peers operating international routes, he said. In a news release, the carrier said it will also restart some international routes it had halted during the pandemic, including to London, and open new ones.",

            "text": "General Electric Co (GE.N)New Tab forecast revenue at its cash-cow aviation business to grow by at least low-double digits through 2025, sending its shares to levels not seen since 2018 on Thursday. The shares rose 5.3% after Chief Executive Larry Culp said at the company's annual day for investors that a recession was \"the last thing on our mind.\" The Boston-based conglomerate's shares have benefited from strong aerospace demand and the recent spinoff of its healthcare business, even as its renewable energy unit has struggled. GE stuck to its profit expectations for 2023 despite the dim economic outlook and persistent supply shortages. It expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.60 to $2.00, with revenue growth in the high single digits. \"We're well positioned to have a strong year,\" Culp said. Through 2025, GE expects profit margins at GE Aerospace to be about 20%, company executives told investors at a conference in Ohio. A jump in air travel has driven up sales at its aerospace division, which makes and services engines for Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab and Airbus SE (AIR.PA)New Tab jets. \"The bottom line is that management are putting out pretty impressive targets for Aero through 2025, with the long-term framework for Vernova also above our base case,\" Wolfe Research analyst Nigel Coe said, referring to GE energy businesses. Culp said while GE is not recession-proof, it is enjoying \"incredible\" order backlog and demand. The company expects the aerospace business to generate double-digit revenue growth this year, translating into an operating profit of $5.3 billion-$5.7 billion. GE also said it is possible that lucrative repair revenues from the CFM56 engine that powered the previous generation of Boeing and Airbus narrow-body jets would continue for years to come. Planemakers have struggled to raise production, so jets are being retired later than anticipated. Supply and labor shortages have hurt jet engine output, with CEO Culp saying it was a daily battle to meet jet engine demand. Nearly half of the industry's most popular jet engines have not seen the first shop visit, GE said. GE said it was aligned with Boeing and Airbus on demand for LEAP jet engines through 2024, adding that 2025 supplies were being discussed as part of a standard process. Engines supplied by CFM International, GE's joint venture with France's Safran SA (SAF.PA)New Tab , power Boeing's 737 MAX jets and about half of Airbus' A320/321neo family. The comments imply a commitment to support Airbus plans to lift narrow-body output to 65 jets a month from 45, but leave question marks over the planemaker's further push to take it to 75 a month. Airbus last month said it could reach production of 65 a month by the end of 2024 and plans to hit 75 a month in 2026. Airbus has said it is confident that demand for jets would support the higher production rate but has given itself another year to get there, compared with earlier proposals, due to supply chain pressures. GE Vernova, the company's portfolio of energy businesses, including renewables, is expected to report an operating loss of between $200 million and $600 million in 2023. The troubled renewable business is expected to be profitable in 2024, GE said. However, the unit has failed to turn a profit in the past eight quarters due to weak demand, higher raw materials and labor costs as well as supply-chain pressures. Onshore wind is the largest of GE's renewable businesses, but in the United States, which has been the company's most profitable onshore wind market, policy uncertainty following the expiry of renewable electricity production tax credits in 2021 hit customer demand. While wind tax credits offered under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have boosted demand in North America, the company does not expect a meaningful improvement in the onshore business in the first half of 2023. These troubles have cast a shadow over GE's spin-off timeline for Vernova, but Culp said energy businesses are \"preparing to stand on their own sometime in early 2024.\"",

            "text": "Southwest Airlines (LUV.N)New Tab Chief Executive Bob Jordan said on Wednesday the carrier is not counting on deploying the Boeing (BA.N)New Tab MAX 7 plane this year, which is still awaiting certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). \"We're dependent on Boeing. And there's progress. It's about six months between when it's certified and we can put it into service,\" Jordan told reporters at an Aero Club event in Washington. \"We're not counting on it to be in service here in 2023.\" Jordan said his \"best guess\" is it will be in service by Southwest in early 2024. Acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen earlier on Wednesday declined to comment on the timeline of when the agency might approve the MAX 7. Boeing said it continues to work with the FAA to meet the requirements for MAX 7 and MAX 10 certification. \"As always, we will follow global regulators' lead in the steps ahead on all certification matters,\" a company spokesman said. Boeing, which has faced supply chain issues, delivered 69 planes to Southwest in 2022, down 45 jets from the 114 the company planned to deliver, Jordan said, adding Boeing has agreed to boost deliveries this year. Boeing has unfilled orders of 388 737 MAXs for Southwest and 271 of those are for MAX 7s. \"Boeing is committed to 100 this year, so that's going to push aircraft into '24. The good thing is, it's really not having an impact on our capacity because right now the constraint is pilots,\" Jordan said. \"The constraint is not aircraft. So until you get to early '24, it really doesn't change our capacity plan.\" Jordan added that, if MAX 7 entry into service is delayed, Boeing will deliver additional MAX 8s to Southwest this year in lieu of MAX 7s. Boeing deferred to Southwest on its delivery plans for the company. Congress late last year granted Boeing a waiver lifting a December deadline imposing a new safety standard for modern cockpit alerts for the MAX 7 and MAX 10, the new versions of the U.S. planemaker's best-selling 737 MAX aircraft. Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said in January the planemaker thinks the first delivery for the 7 \"will be this year and probably for the 10 the next year.\"",

            "text": "Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab announced a record 500-plane deal with Indian airline IndiGo (INGL.NS)New Tab on day one of the Paris Airshow on Monday, as strong demand for jets and air defences vied for attention with the industry's supply chain problems. The multibillion-dollar deal for single-aisle planes - the largest ever by number of aircraft - confirmed a Reuters report earlier this month, and eclipsed Air India's provisional purchase of 470 Airbus and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab jets earlier this year. The world's largest air show, which alternates with Farnborough in Britain, is at Le Bourget for the first time in four years after the 2021 edition fell victim to the pandemic. French President Emmanuel Macron flew in to the packed aerospace bazaar by helicopter and watched a flying demonstration including Airbus's latest jet development, the A321XLR, and air power including the French Rafale fighter. On the civilian side, planemakers arrived with growing demand expectations as airlines rush for capacity to meet demand and help reach industry goals of net zero emissions by 2050. But they also face a challenge to meet that demand as suppliers struggle with rising costs, parts shortages and a scarcity of skilled labour in the wake of the pandemic. Industry executives say as many as 2,000 jet orders are up for grabs worldwide in a resurgent commercial jet market, on top of those provisionally announced already, as airlines try to fill a void left by sharp falls in activity in the COVID crisis. But only a portion of these potential fresh deals will be ready in time for this week's air show, which could see a mixture of new and repeat announcements, they said. \"It is only when these appear in the year-end backlog that we have any idea of the strength of the market and the quality of the orders,\" said Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa. IndiGo's deal highlights the growing importance of India, the world's fastest-growing aviation market, serving the largest population, to planemakers. \"This is just the beginning, there's more going forward. With the growth of India (and) the growth of the Indian aviation market ... this is the right time for us to place this order,\" IndiGo Chief Executive Pieter Elbers told a news conference. In another key market, Airbus said Saudi budget airline flynas had firmed up an order for 30 of its A320neo-family narrowbody aircraft, confirming a Bloomberg report. The air show is taking place under the shadow of the conflict in Ukraine, with no Russian presence in the chalets and exhibition halls in contrast to the last event four years ago. A Ukrainian minister told Reuters that Kyiv is in talks with Western arms manufacturers to boost production of weapons, including drones, and could sign contracts in coming months. Belgium said it would apply to join as an observer the potential successor to the Rafale and multinational Eurofighter, the Franco-German-Spanish FCAS fighter project, despite differences between industrial partners over whether to expand. France's Thales (TCFP.PA)New Tab also announced a contract from Indonesia for 13 long-range air surveillance radars. Looking ahead to the rest of the show, Air India may finalise its recent huge order, split between Airbus and Boeing, as Irish lessor Avolon finalises a deal with Boeing which is having a relatively quiet show after a string of recent orders. Airbus is seen close to a potentially large deal with Mexico's Viva Aerobus, but by Monday some sources were predicting the volume could be closer to 60 jets than the triple digits first reported, with no guarantee of a result this week. And with increased bargaining power at their disposal from tight supplies, airline executives say planemakers are being tougher on price and more circumspect than in previous upcycles. Engine makers are meanwhile sketching bets on fuel-saving technology that will influence how jets evolve next decade.",

            "text": "China's three biggest airlines on Wednesday reported wider losses in the final quarter of 2021, marking the second year in the red due to COVID-19 as hopes for a recovery remain distant while the country tries to halt the virus' fast spread. Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines (600115.SS)New Tab , said its net loss rose to 4.05 billion yuan ($637.64 million)from 2.95 billion yuan in the third quarter, taking its full-year loss to 12.2 billion yuan. That is deeper than an 11.8 billion yuan loss in 2020. The airline also faces closer regulatory scrutiny following the crash of a Boeing 737-800 (BA.N)New Tab jet last week that killed 132 people on board, which has led it to ground 223 planes of that type as a precaution while the investigation proceeds. read more The company will closely monitor the ongoing investigation into the cause of the crash and evaluate the impact on its financial performance and operational results, said the carrier in its annual report. Beijing-based Air China (601111.SS)New Tab , the country's flag carrier, said its net loss widened to 6.32 billion yuan in the fourth quarter from 3.54 billion yuan and it posted a full-year loss of 16.6 billion yuan. China Southern Airlines (600029.SS)New Tab fell to a fourth-quarter net loss of 5.98 billion yuan, after posting 1.43 billion yuan in the red the previous quarter. It reported a full-year loss of 12.1 billion yuan. The Guangzhou-based airline also forecasted a pickup in deliveries of the Boeing 737 series aircraft from 2022, as Chinese carriers are set to resume commercial services of the 737 MAX, which was grounded in China for over two and a half years. China's domestic travel market, which had rebounded quickly due to its successful containment of the COVID-19 virus in the early days of the pandemic, is nursing heavy losses as authorities struggle to stop the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant under its strategy of eliminating cases. More than two-thirds of planned flights are being cancelled every day across China, according to third-party aviation data providers, while financial capital Shanghai is in the middle of a two-stage lockdown of 26 million people. Data firm OAG said on Tuesday that China's available seat capacity this week was down 10.2% from a week earlier and 24.4% from the same week last year. A strong yuan currency was again a favourable factor this year, offering some relief to Chinese airlines that have financed a large portion of their foreign debt obligations in U.S. dollars. However, high fuel costs, which already inflated costs last year, are set to weigh on bottom lines this year, as Russia's war in Ukraine heightens geopolitical risks and reinforces broader inflationary pressures across the supply chain. Brent crude futures stood at $113 a barrel, up 45% from the end of last year. China remains virtually shut off from international markets as already reduced flights get suspended under its \"circuit breaker\" system when there are COVID-19 positive arrivals, leaving many passengers stranded abroad. Domestic flights over the northern summer season that began this week and lasts through October are set to reach 117,000 flights per day, up 6.8% from a year ago, according to aviation data provider Flight Master, although a large number of them could be cancelled.

            "text": "A cybercriminal group named Lockbit, which was broken up by an international law enforcement operation this week, has hacked some of the world's largest organisations in recent months, stealing and leaking their sensitive data if they didn't pay ransom. Here are some details about the group: Lockbit was discovered in 2020 when its eponymous malicious software was found on Russian-language cybercrime forums. On Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department charged two Russian nationals with deploying Lockbit ransomware against companies and groups around the world. Police in Poland and Ukraine made two arrests. The gang has not professed support for any government nor has any government formally attributed it to a nation-state. \"We are located in the Netherlands, completely apolitical and only interested in money,\" the gang said on its now defunct darkweb site. In just three years, it had become the world's top ransomware threat, according to U.S. officials. Nowhere has it been more disruptive than in the United States, hitting more than 1,700 American organisations in nearly every industry from financial services and food to schools, transportation and government departments. Among its victims was defense and aerospace giant Boeing (BA.N)New Tab . Last November, Lockbit leaked a cache of internal data it had obtained by breaching Boeing's systems. Earlier in 2023 the gang's hack into the financial-trading services group ION disrupted operations at customers that included some of the world's biggest banks, brokerages and hedge funds. It also breached the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China(ICBC), disrupting trading in the market for U.S. Treasury securities. The cybercrime gang infected a victim organisation's system with ransomware - malicious software that encrypts data - and then coerced targets into paying ransom to decrypt or unlock it. Such ransom is usually demanded in the form of cryptocurrency, which is harder to trace and gives the receiver anonymity. U.S. and other officials in a 40-country alliance had been trying to stem the global scourge of ransomware by sharing intelligence between nations on the cryptocurrency wallet addresses of such criminals. On the dark web, Lockbit's blog displayed an ever-growing gallery of victim organisations that was updated nearly daily. Next to their names were digital clocks showing the number of days left to the deadline given to each organisation to provide ransom payment, failing which, the gang would publish the sensitive data it had collected. Often victim organisations will seek the help of cybersecurity companies to identify what data was leaked and negotiate ransom amounts with the hackers. Such behind-the-scenes talks usually remained private and could sometimes take days or weeks, according to security analysts. It was common for some victim names to not show up on the Lockbit blog if the threat was made privately. In part, Lockbit's success depended on its so-called \"affiliates\" - likeminded criminal groups that were recruited to wage attacks using Lockbit's digital extortion tools. On its website, the gang boasted of its successes in hacking various organisations and laid out a detailed set of rules for cybercriminals who could submit an \"application form\" to work with them. \"Ask your friends or acquaintances who already work with us to vouch for you,\" one of those rules said. This web of alliances between cybercriminal groups makes tracking such hacking activity and attempts to ransom victims difficult, since their tactics and techniques can vary with each attack.",

Atlas Air offers air leasing services that can be used for shipping perishables, heavy construction equipment or passengers. The company's customers include Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab , FedEx Corp (FDX.N)New Tab and MotoGP, according to its website. Prospects of airlines have improved this year thanks to pent-up demand for travel and the easing of COVID-19 curbs, but the industry's recovery faces risks from surging fuel prices and staff shortages in a tight labor market. In second-quarter results reported on Thursday, Atlas Air's profit fell 18% as higher spending on fuel and employee wages drove up expenses by 26%. The company's shares were slightly higher in premarket trading after rising nearly 28% this week amid speculation on the deal, which gives Atlas an enterprise of $5.2 billion and also includes affiliates of J.F. Lehman & Co and Hill City Capital. Atlas said it expects the buyout to close in the fourth quarter of 2022 or the first quarter 2023.

It’s likely, in other words, that Laster will have to pick from at least three competing bids to run the breach-of-duty case. The judge has scheduled a Nov. 9 hearing on the leadership contest.    I don’t think Laster will find a whole lot of difference among the Fox candidates on the ability of their lawyers to prosecute the case. All of these firms have excellent track records. The Friedlander and Lieff firms, which represent the New York and Oregon funds, obtained a in 2021 in breach-of-duty claims against Boeing (BA.N)New Tab\ndirectors for allegedly failing to assure the safety of 737 MAX aircraft. (They won a lead role in that case, incidentally, after a hot lead-plaintiff contest.) Labaton and Robbins Geller, two of the firms that signed the multifund complaint, were part of a plaintiffs’ consortium that was just awarded a after winning a $1 billion settlement in a breach-of-duty case against Dell (DELL.N)New Tab\ndirectors. (The judge who awarded the fee? Laster.) Prickett Jones, meanwhile, was co-counsel in the 2013 case that resulted in the biggest-ever Chancery Court fee award.         ",

Speaking to Reuters, he said the load factor, a measure of how well an airline is filling available seats, should be around 94% in June, almost reaching pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. \"And July, August, and September look very strong with higher load factors and also higher fares,\" he said. \"Fares will be up probably high single digits 7,8,9 percent over summer 2019.\" He said he expects the travelling experience for European customers to improve over summer as airport management groups \"iron out\" staffing shortages through recruitment. A snapback in air travel has triggered long queues at some British airports, as well as Amsterdam, Dublin and Toronto, as airport managers struggle to fill jobs fast enough. Spanish cabin staff on Monday said they will go on strike six days late June and early July, but O'Leary said any disruption caused by industrial action was likely to be \"tiny and inconsequential\". He said there might be a small number of cancellations or delays but that the proposed strike action has \"no support\". He said there was no progress in talks with Boeing regarding the acquisition of new aircraft, and he reiterated his criticism of the planemakers management, saying that Ryanair last spoke to Boeing \"two or three months ago\". Boeing has said it sold more than 700 MAX jets last year and will not do deals at unrealistic prices.",

            "text": "New orders for U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in September, the Commerce Department said on Thursday, suggesting a loss of momentum in business spending on equipment at the end of the third quarter. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.7% during the month, the department said. These so-called core capital goods orders increased 0.8% in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.5%. The data is not adjusted for inflation. Core capital goods shipments slipped 0.5% after advancing 0.2% in August. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product measurement. The data was included in Thursday's advance third-quarter GDP report, which showed business spending on equipment rebounding sharply after contracting in the second quarter. The overall economy rebounded after two straight quarterly declines, largely driven by a smaller trade deficit. The Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes as it fights inflation are curbing demand for goods and slowing manufacturing which accounts for 11.3% of the economy. Dollar strength as a result of tighter monetary policy is also hurting manufacturing, as well an emerging inventory overhang. Manufacturing output rose at a 1.9% annualized rate in the third quarter after increasing at a 3.2% pace in the second quarter, data from the Fed showed last week. Orders for items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more gained 0.4% in September after climbing 0.2% in August. They were lifted by a 2.1% jump in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 0.6% increase in August. Motor vehicle orders accelerated 2.2%. Orders for the volatile civilian aircraft category soared 21.9% after falling 8.6% in August. Boeing (BA.N)New Tab said on its website it had received 96 aircraft orders last month, compared to 30 in August.",

            "text": "A collapse in the yen is forcing Japan to scale back a historic five-year, 43.5-trillion-yen defence build-up aimed at helping to deter a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, according to eight people familiar with the matter. Since the plan was unveiled in December, the yen has lost 10% of its value against the dollar, forcing Tokyo to reduce its ambitious defence procurement plan, which was then-calculated to cost $320 billion, the sources said. Reuters interviewed three government officials with direct knowledge of defence procurement and five industry sources, who said Japan will begin cutting back on aircraft purchases in 2024, the second year of the build-up, due to the weak yen. Details of how Japan is paring back military procurement due to currency fluctuations have not been previously reported. The eight people, who attended numerous meetings on the purchases, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to media. Tokyo assumed an exchange rate of 108 yen to the dollar - a rate last traded at in summer 2021 - when it began formulating purchase plans in December, the eight people said. By early November, the currency dipped to 151 to the dollar. The Bank of Japan on Tuesday took a small step toward ending the decade-long monetary stimulus, which has driven yen depreciation, by tweaking bond yield controls. Unlike large companies that do business overseas, Japan's defence ministry does not hedge against currency rate fluctuations, one of the government officials said, meaning it has few means to mitigate the rising cost in yen of Tomahawk cruise missiles and F-35 stealth fighters. Any sign that Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will get less bang than anticipated from his military spending binge could stir unease in Washington about its key ally's ability to help contain Beijing, said Christopher Johnstone, Japan chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. \"For now, the impact is modest. But there is no question that a long-term depreciation of the yen would sap the impact of Japan's build-up, and force cuts and delays to key acquisitions,\" said Johnstone, a former National Security Council director for East Asia in the Biden administration. Japan's Ministry of Defence said it does not discuss details of procurement planning when contacted for comment. The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said it was unable to comment. The Pentagon did not immediately return a request for comment. Kishida described Japan's biggest defence build-up since World War Two as a \"turning point in history.\" The spending is meant gird the nation for possible conflict around its far-flung islands stretching along the edge of the East China Sea toward Taiwan, according to defence white papers. Tokyo also shares responsibility for protecting U.S. bases on its soil that Washington could use to launch counter strikes against Chinese forces attacking the self-governing democratic island. In December, Kishida pledged to double annual defence outlays to 2% of gross domestic product. A move to transform the war-renouncing nation into potentially the world's third-biggest military spender was seen by analysts and lawmakers as improbable until two years ago. That changed when Russian forces rolled into Ukraine in February 2022, in an invasion that Tokyo worries will embolden Beijing to strike Taiwan. China stoked Japanese fears again that August by firing missiles into waters close to its territory in response to then-U.S. house speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. That came after months of intensifying Chinese activity in East Asia, including joint sorties with Russian forces. China, which has not ruled out using military force to bring Taiwan under its control, has expressed concern about Japan's military spending plans, accusing it of displaying a \"Cold War mentality.\" With the cuts in its spending power, Japan decided to prioritize spending on advanced U.S.-made frontline weapons such as missiles that could halt advancing Chinese forces, the eight people said. That means less money on support aircraft and other secondary kit, much of it made by Japanese companies, they said. In December, defence ministry officials discussed an order for 34 twin-rotor Chinook transport helicopters at roughly 15 billion yen per aircraft, two of the sources said. In the defence budget request for the year starting April 2024, which was published in August, that order was halved to 17 because the cost of the aircraft had jumped by around 5 billion yen each since December. About half that increase was due to the weak yen, said one of the government sources, who was directly involved in those discussions. The aircraft are assembled by Kawasaki Heavy Industries (7012.T)New Tab under license from Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab . A Kawasaki spokesperson confirmed that the unit cost increase had resulted in a reduction in the Chinook order. Japan also scrapped a plan to buy two ShinMaywa Industries (7224.T)New Tab US-2 seaplanes used for search and rescue missions after the price per aircraft almost doubled to 30 billion yen compared with three years ago, said two other people familiar with the spending plans. \"The price has risen considerably, and that is because the weaker yen and inflation have significantly pushed up costs,\" a company spokesperson said. She declined to comment on whether the defence ministry had dropped an order for the seaplane. For Kishida, who must grapple with rival ruling-party factions that are sparring over whether to borrow money or hike taxes to pay for his defence build-up, pruning equipment purchases may be politically less fraught than asking lawmakers for top-ups, analysts said. \"Whether Kishida decides to increase the budget or do nothing will depend on his support rate in Japan,\" said Yoji Koda, a retired Maritime Self Defense Force admiral, who commanded the Japanese fleet. He expects the Japanese leader to opt for procurement cuts or delays because it's easier than convincing taxpayers to fork out more money. But, by sidestepping that challenge, Kishida is also inviting a backlash from Japanese companies that worry they will bear the brunt of cuts to ensure Tokyo can afford Raytheon (RTX.N)New Tab Tomahawks and the F-35 jets it has ordered from Lockheed Martin (LMT.N)New Tab . In a sign of growing discontent, the Japan Business Federation, the country's most influential corporate lobby, joined several defence industry associations in October to press the defence ministry for extra military procurement funds in a supplementary budget now before parliament, one of the sources said. A ministry spokesperson confirmed the companies delivered a letter on Oct 25 to Defence Minister Minoru Kihara urging the government to proceed with the defence procurement as planned. The business lobby declined to comment. Defence firms will struggle to get more money because the government will want to hold off on adding to the 43 trillion-yen plan to see if the currency situation changes, said Kevin Maher at NMV Consulting in Washington, who headed the U.S. State Department's Office of Japan Affairs. \"If they think it will impact capabilities then it is possible, but I think at the earliest that would be in the next to last year of the five-year plan,\" he said.

President Joe Biden had directed the EPA in January to consider whether to rewrite the airplane emissions rules, which face a legal challenge from 12 states and three environmental groups that say the rules do not go far enough. Instead, the Biden administration said on Monday, it will press for ambitious new international emissions standards at the upcoming round of international negotiations in February at the U.N. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Joe Goffman, the acting head of the EPA Air and Radiation office, told Reuters in an interview Monday, that it was important to work with the international community and to move quickly on the next round of emissions talks. \"We could have really achieved a Pyrrhic victory by tightening the rule and then finding the aviation industry avoided complying by certifying their engines via other governments,\" Goffman said. Liz Jones, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the groups that sued, said \"the Biden administration has taken climate hypocrisy and delay to new heights.... The EPA twiddled its thumbs for nine months before deciding it would rather defend a do-nothing rule than set any meaningful limits on aircraft emissions.\" The states said in February the regulation's greenhouse gas emission standards \"by EPA’s own analysis, will fail to reduce the emissions of any aircraft, and will prompt no action at all by manufacturers to reduce aircraft emissions.\" They argue the EPA should have considered that \"minority and low-income communities are disproportionately located near airports and exposed to greater criteria and hazardous air pollutants from aircraft takeoff and landing emissions, which more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards could have reduced.\" The new rules apply to new-type designs as of January 2020 and to in-production airplanes or those with amended type certificates starting in 2028. Goffman said rewriting the rule \"would have been disruptive for our industry, it would have been disruptive for the international process and in the three-dimensional world not gained us anything.\" Airplanes have been the largest source of transportation greenhouse gas emissions not subject to rules. In 2016, ICAO agreed on global airplane emissions standards aimed at makers of small and large planes, including Airbus SE (AIR.PA)New Tab and Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab , which both endorsed the rules. The ICAO emissions standards effort began under former President Barack Obama's administration, and was finalized under Trump in January. Boeing argued the EPA should not rewrite the rules, saying \"attempts to overturn regulation directly aligned with successful cooperative international efforts to combat climate change, supported by more than 190 countries, will only discourage future international agreements.\" Last week, the United States set a goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from the U.S. aviation sector by 2050. The White House said in September it was targeting 20% lower aviation emissions by 2030, as airlines facing pressure from environmental groups to lower their carbon footprint pledged to use more sustainable aviation fuel.",

Bill LaPlante, current head of Charles Stark Draper Laboratories Inc., is the Biden administration's pick to be the next Undersecretary of Acquisition and Sustainment at the Department of Defense. His nomination process will be closely watched by defense contractors given the vital role the official will have in drawing up the Pentagon's massive annual purchasing budget, the lifeblood of Lockheed Martin Co (LMT.N)New Tab , Northrop Grumman (NOC.N)New Tab and General Dynamics (GD.N)New Tab . If confirmed, LaPlante would rejoin a team of former Barack Obama administration alumni, including current Deputy Secretary of Defense Kath Hicks, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall as well as Andrew Hunter, Biden's nominee for assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, technology and logistics. Kendall and LaPlante worked together overseeing acquisition for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet, the Boeing (BA.N)New Tab KC-46 refueling tanker and the B-21 Raider, a heavy bomber under development for the U.S. Air Force by Northrop Grumman during the Obama administration. The Pentagon has been without a Senate-confirmed weapons-buyer since January. The Biden administration has struggled to have a candidate for the high-powered position after its first nominee withdrew from consideration this summer. Without a leader, professional staff have been forced to act as caretakers for nearly 11 months, delaying big decisions on weapons programs. If confirmed, LaPlante, who holds a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from the Catholic University of America, would return to the Pentagon's E-Ring corridor.",

Shares in the company dropped more than 5% after the report and a conference call with analysts, making it one of the biggest fallers on Brazil's Bovespa stock index (.BVSP)New Tab , which was trading near flat. Embraer posted a quarterly adjusted net loss of 93.8 million reais ($17.62 million), narrower than the 179.7 million-real loss a year ago despite net revenue dropping 3% to 4.87 billion reais. The world's third-largest planemaker behind Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab had already disclosed its quarterly aircraft deliveries, up 10% year on year to 33 jets but still below some analyst projections. Apart from a boost to its free cash flow full-year outlook, the company said on Monday it was keeping all financial and delivery forecasts unchanged heading into the fourth quarter, which tends to concentrate deliveries. The company increased its free cash flow outlook for the full year to $150 million or more from a previous estimate of $50 million or more, saying results so far have outperformed initial expectations. Embraer has been grappling with supply chain constraints this year and chief financial officer Antonio Carlos Garcia told analysts this should keep annual deliveries at the lower end of the forecasted 100 to 110 executive jets and 60 to 70 commercial jets, with a \"minor risk\" to the downside. Santander analysts said the results missed their projections, but the reaffirmed delivery outlook was positive given the risks from supply chain issues. Chief executive Francisco Gomes Neto said he expects the supply chain hurdles to continue in the first half of 2023 and return to normal only in 2024. ($1 = 5.3250 reais)",

Barnett had worked at Boeing for 32 years before leaving the company in 2017, according to the BBCNew Tab , which previously reported on his efforts to raise issues about the company's production issues. The 62-year-old died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the Charleston County coroner's office in South Carolina confirmed on Tuesday. The Charleston City police are investigating, the coroner's office said, without giving any other details. Barnett was in the middle of a deposition in an ongoing whistleblower retaliation case against Boeing, according to a statement from his attorneys, Robert Turkewitz and Brian Knowles. \"He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on. We didn't see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it,\" they said. Barnett was a quality manager at Boeing. He had \"exposed very serious safety problems with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and was retaliated against and subjected to a hostile work environment,\" his attorneys said. Boeing, in a statement, said: “We are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.” Barnett had spoken to media outlets following the Jan. 5 incident on a Boeing 737 MAX 9 plane, when a panel blew out while the flight was in mid-air, exposing passengers to the outside air that required an emergency landing. Boeing has since had to reckon with a full-blown crisis around its safety and quality standards. Its production has been curbed by U.S. regulators, leading to delivery delays across the aerospace industry.",

The Defense Department is influential with the antitrust agencies on decisions about approving deals that touch on military issues, and often take too soft an approach, Warren and the other lawmakers wrote. \"Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Boeing are all dependent on products that only Aerojet is able to produce, and their operations could be hamstrung by its acquisition,\" they wrote.

In addition to Warren, the letter was signed by Representatives Chris Deluzio, John Garamendi and Mark Pocan. All are Democrats. The lawmakers said the department had previously conducted what the letter called \"flawed merger reviews.\" With the Ukraine war driving up demand for missiles and defense systems, Aerojet became an attractive takeover target. L3Harris was formed by the merger of L3 Technologies and Harris Corp in 2019. The United States has assisted Ukraine with billions of dollars in military aid, including missiles and air defense systems. Aerojet develops and manufactures liquid and solid rocket propulsion and hypersonic engines for space, defense, civil and commercial applications.

A spokesperson for the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) said it had extended a 24-hour precautionary suspension of Comair's operator certificate indefinitely. The suspension was meant to end on Sunday, but Comair has not adequately addressed all the necessary safety issues, the SACAA said. read more \"This morning we communicated to them (Comair) that their air operator certificate is now indefinitely suspended until they close all of the findings,\" SACAA spokesperson Phindiwe Gwebu told Reuters, effectively grounding the company's fleet of Boeing (BA.N)New Tab aircraft. Comair said it was unable to confirm when it would start flying again, after working through the night to provide documentation to SACAA following a review of certain policies, systems and procedures. \"This is a huge blow to our customers, employees and the flying public as it effectively takes 40% of the capacity out of the market,\" Glenn Orsmond, Comair chief executive said in a statement. There would be considerable implications for the aviation sector and the country should the suspension be prolonged, he added. Airports Company SA (ACSA), which runs the country's largest airports, said some of the stranded passengers were placed on chartered flights arranged by BA and Comair, specifically for commuters on the popular Johannesburg and Cape Town route. \"Priority is also given to those passengers who have onward international connecting flights,\" Terence Delomoney, ACSA's group executive operations manager said. Issuing the precautionary notice on Saturday, the regulator said in the past month Comair had experienced safety problems ranging from \"engine failures, engine malfunction and landing gear malfunctions,\" among others. In its investigations, SACAA said it had discovered three so-called \"level 1\" findings \"which pose an immediate risk\" and must be addressed immediately. Gwebu did not elaborate on what outstanding safety issues Comair, which flies local and regional routes from South Africa under the British Airways (BA) livery as part of a licence agreement, needed to address before flying again. Besides flying BA planes, Comair also operates the Kulula brand. A notice on Kulula's website showed that Comair had been aiming to resume its schedule by 12 p.m. (1000 GMT) on Sunday, subject to SACAA's approval. \"We will do everything we can to accommodate customers affected by the suspension on other flights, prioritising vulnerable customers and those who most urgently needed to travel,\" Comair said, adding that customers would also be kept informed via text.",

            "text": "Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab faces delays in introducing an ultra-long-range version of its A350-1000 jet designed for Qantas Airways' (QAN.AX)New Tab non-stop Sydney-London flights because a regulator has asked it to redesign an extra fuel tank, a senior executive said. \"The regulator has asked us to redesign the centre tank on the ultra-long-range airplane for Sunrise,\" Christian Scherer, the CEO of Airbus' commercial aircraft business said on Thursday on the sidelines of the Singapore Airshow, referring to the airline's \"Project Sunrise\" flights from Sydney to London. Qantas said on Thursday the delivery dates for its first A350-1000 planes capable of the ultra-long-range flights had been pushed back by about six months to mid-2026. \"We have to redesign the centre tank, the extra fuel tank, that will allow the Sunrise mission, and that's what explains the shift,\" Scherer said. Global aviation regulators have been more closely scrutinising design changes on aircraft variants since two deadly Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019, in which a new anti-stall system was a contributing factor. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said it was working with Airbus to define the requirements and means of compliance for the fuel tank to be installed on the ultra-long-range version of the A350-1000. \"This is a collaborative process aimed at achieving the required level of safety for this new design feature,\" an EASA spokesperson said in a statement. \"EASA is confident the certification process in place will achieve its goals, thanks to the good level of cooperation between all stakeholders.\" Airbus had faced delays in its A321XLR long-range narrow-body programme after concerns were raised with regulators that a novel type of fuel tank could pose fire risks. The issues have since been resolved. Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson said the A350-1000 delay was due to certification of the first aircraft taking longer than expected. \"However, we believe that the fleet for the 12 aircraft that will come, will come relatively quickly after that,\" she told reporters. Hudson added that demand for non-stop flying remained strong, as shown by the carrier's Perth-London flights and new Perth-Paris services. \"So we are more than ever confident that the business case still stands, and that the aircraft's six-month delay is not a concern,\" she said.",

            "text": "Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab is quietly relaxing pressure on suppliers to commit to a sharp output hike to 75 narrow-body jets a month by mid-decade, amid growing doubts over the ability of battered supply chains to meet the deadline, industry sources said. Officially, Airbus continues to target output of 75 narrow-body jets a month in 2025, after an interim target of 65 jets slipped last month. It is poised to reaffirm both output goals at an investor meeting later this week, industry sources said. But as more suppliers sound the alarm over parts and labour shortages, Airbus has privately recognised the challenges of reaching the higher target by 2025 even as it sticks firmly to an earlier goal of 65 a month, up from 50 or so now, they said. Requests for detailed plans of how suppliers will get to 75 are \"going quiet,\" a senior aerospace source told Reuters. In July, Airbus pushed back its interim target for 65 A320-family jets a month by six months to early 2024, citing \"supply chain challenges\". At the same time, Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said Airbus continued to aim for 75 a month in 2025. \"The A320-family monthly production target of 75 for 2025 remains unchanged,\" an Airbus spokesperson said on Wednesday. The head of the world's largest aerospace supplier, Raytheon Technologies (RTX.N)New Tab Chief Executive Greg Hayes, last week called into question this end-target. \"If you take a look at the projections for Airbus, we think that Airbus by 2025 will be at rate 65 (a month). And Guillaume (Faury) might say rate 75, but we think rate 65 is doable,\" he told a Morgan Stanley conference. Others say the end-target is achievable but not before 2026. A Jefferies poll of suppliers published on Wednesday suggested parts shortages would remain \"largely through the end of 2023\". Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa said a worsening economy pointed to \"another bumpy year\" in 2023, indicating flatter growth in production through 2025 than Airbus would like. Some aircraft buyers have also questioned the targets. \"There will be bumps along the way. They may get to 75 (a month), but not necessarily by 2025,\" BOC Aviation (2588.HK)New Tab Chief Executive Robert Martin told Reuters. Much will depend on whether manufacturers can resolve supply chain difficulties next year, he said. \"But then we have a different problem: potentially there's a demand problem, which is what happens in Europe in particular.\" Europe is facing a winter energy crisis expected to weigh on consumer spending. Even so, Airbus and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab remain optimistic on underlying travel and airplane demand. In July, Airbus raised its forecasts for jet deliveries over the next 20 years as high fuel bills and environmental pressures prompt airlines to seek more fuel-efficient planes. Industry sources say it is also under pressure to raise output to whittle down a bulge of orders in the middle of the decade after many airlines deferred deliveries during COVID-19. The Airbus spokesperson said on Wednesday the company's production decisions follow \"analysis of global demand and an assessment of the readiness of the industrial eco-system\".",

The largest U.S. business lobbying group mapped out its recommendations in a four-page memorandum sent to U.S. officials as President Joe Biden began his first trip abroadNew Tab , an eight-day mission to rebuild trans-Atlantic ties strained during the Trump era and to reframe relations with Russia. U.S. and EU officials are expected to launch a new trade and technology council during the summit that will set compatible standards and facilitate trade in fields such as artificial intelligence and data flows, according to U.S. and EU sources. In its memo, which was seen by Reuters, the Chamber said Biden's June 15 summit with EU leaders was the right occasion to launch such a platform and align on clear shared priorities. Doing so, it said, could help advance economic recovery \"by eliminating existing barriers to transatlantic commerce, preventing new barriers, and establishing joint approaches on foundational and emerging technologies.\" Closer cooperation would allow the two sides to craft more coordinated and effective responses to \"countries that do not respect global trade rules and norms and pose significant threats to our security and values,\" an apparent reference to Russia and China.

            "text": "The fate of shareholder derivative suits claiming violations of the Securities and Exchange Act now depends on geography, after a ruling Friday from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The 9th Circuit held in Lee v. The Gap IncNew Tab that the retailer's bylaw requiring shareholders to litigate derivative claims in Delaware Chancery Court is enforceable, even if enforcement effectively eliminates shareholders’ ability to assert an Exchange Act case on behalf of the corporation. Under this decision, in other words, companies based in California and other states in the 9th Circuit can eliminate the risk of an Exchange Act derivative suit by adopting a forum selection clause that steers shareholders' derivative claims to state court. That’s not possible, however, for companies in Illinois and other states in the 7th Circuit. In January, as I reportedNew Tab , a divided 7th Circuit panel rejectedNew Tab The Boeing Co’s bid to enforce its Chancery Court forum selection clause in an Exchange Act derivative suit arising from alleged misrepresentations about the board’s oversight of 737 MAX jet safety issues. The 7th Circuit majority ruled that it would be contrary to both federal and Delaware law and policy to send the derivative suit to Chancery Court because shareholders would then have no jurisdiction to assert their derivative Exchange Act claims. The 9th Circuit panel in the Gap case – Judges Richard Clifton, Milan Smith and U.S. District Judge Christina Reiss of Burlington, Vermont, sitting by designation – addressed the 7th Circuit’s conflicting Boeing decision in a single paragraph in Friday's decision. Much of the Boeing court’s reasoning, the 9th Circuit said, was based on a provisionNew Tab of Delaware’s corporate code that permits companies to adopt forum selection clauses for “internal corporate claims.” The 7th Circuit concluded that the provision is tailored to respect federal law and does not “empower corporations to use such techniques to opt out of the Exchange Act.” But the shareholder suing The Gap’s board for allegedly misrepresenting the company’s commitment to diverse leadership did not assert arguments about that particular Delaware provision in her opening brief, the 9th Circuit said, so she waived reliance on it. Moreover, the 9th Circuit disagreed with the 7th Circuit’s holding that the Exchange Act’s anti-waiver provision precludes enforcement of a forum selection clause that would effectively kill shareholders’ ability to bring derivative claims under the statute. The Exchange Act, as you know, bars companies from mandating a waiver of compliance from its statutory regulations. It also vests exclusive jurisdiction for Exchange Act claims in federal court. The 7th Circuit majority in Boeing said that companies therefore cannot enforce a forum selection provision that would require shareholders to sue in a court that does not have jurisdiction to hear their claims. (In dissent, as I’ve explained, 7th Circuit Judge Frank Easterbrook argued that Chancery Court, in fact, could hear state-court breach-of-duty claims arising from the Exchange Act. Boeing opted not to file an en banc petition to test Easterbrook's theory.) The 9th Circuit in the Gap case said that under its binding precedent, the “strong federal policy in favor of enforcing forum-selection clauses” trumps the Exchange Act’s anti-waiver provision. The court cited 2018’s Sun v. Advanced China Healthcare IncNew Tab , which upheld enforcement of a forum selection clause in a case asserting state-law securities claims. Plaintiffs counsel Frank Bottini of Bottini & Bottini did not respond to my email query about whether his client will seek en banc or U.S. Supreme Court review of the 9th Circuit’s ruling. In a reply briefNew Tab in the Gap case that was submitted after the 7th Circuit's Boeing decision, shareholders argued that they had not waived arguments based on Delaware’s forum selection law. They also argued that 9th Circuit precedent from the Sun case was distinguishable because it did not specifically address the Exchange Act’s anti-waiver provision. The Gap’s lead counsel, Roman Martinez of Latham & Watkins, declined to provide a statement on the 9th Circuit decision. In its appellate briefNew Tab , The Gap argued that the derivative suit should be dismissed not just on forum selection grounds but also because shareholders hadn’t met demand futility requirements and failed to allege any actual misrepresentations in their “demonstrably false” complaint about the company’s diversity. (The Gap told the 9th Circuit that none of Bottini & Bottini's highly publicized derivative suits challenging corporate diversity efforts has survived a defense dismissal motions.) So would the Supreme Court be interested in what appears to be a circuit split? Forum selection proponent Joseph Grundfest of Stanford Law School told me by email that he thinks the circuits’ divergence on a matter of statutory construction would pique the justices’ interest. “I would think that a grant of cert on this split is at least as likely as not, if a petition is filed,” Grundfest said. There are also plenty of reasons for the Supreme Court to give the issue more time to develop. So far, only two circuits have ruled, and the 9th Circuit didn’t give much analysis to the 7th Circuit’s primary Delaware-law based reasoning because of its finding that shareholders failed to preserve those arguments. The Gap would likely also argue that its forum selection was only one of the many reasons why the derivative suit was doomed, so the Supreme Court shouldn’t waste its time. On the other hand, there have been two federal appellate challenges so far to the enforcement of forum selection clauses in Exchange Act derivative suits – and the two courts to have decided those cases reached opposite conclusions. (The shareholder lawyer who prevailed in the Boeing case, Carol Gilden of Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll, told me by email that her team \"continues to believe the majority’s analysis in the Seventh Circuit’s Boeing decision correctly decided the issue.\") If the shareholder bar were eager for Supreme Court consideration of the scope of the Exchange Act’s anti-waiver clause, it could certainly make an argument for the justices to take up the Gap case. Whether plaintiffs lawyers want that review is another story. Read more: Boeing's forum selection bid to send 737 MAX derivative suit to Delaware nixed by 7th CircNew Tab ",

            "text": "U.S. officials want to tinker with the mix of chemicals fueling missiles and rockets to gain an advantage in the Pacific by increasing the range of its frontline munitions so U.S. forces can operate farther away from China. The Pentagon and Congress are looking at a retrofit that could extend ranges for some current weapons as much as 20% by using more powerful propellants and lighter warheads, two congressional aides and two U.S. officials said who spoke to Reuters under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Last week, the Senate revealed bill language earmarking at least $13 million to plan, expand and manufacture chemical compounds that can be used to propel missiles, or replace the explosive material in warheads, known as \"energetics\". Although a fraction of the $886 billion defense bill making its way through Congress, the funding starts a process that could ultimately lead to billions of dollars of new spending on munitions. The Democrat-controlled Senate and Republican-held House of Representatives still need to negotiate final funding levels for the concept, but there is general agreement on the bipartisan effort to deter China. The \"distance in the Indo-Pacific and sheer size of (China's) Navy means the U.S. needs more ship-killing missiles that can reach distant targets,\" Representative Mike Gallagher told Reuters. China views the U.S. in the Pacific as a threat, ramping up its own military presence in response. \"Unfortunately, the Pentagon has grown complacent using 1940s-era energetics and neglected advanced energetics like CL-20 that are necessary to increasing the range and lethality of our force. Every foot farther a missile can travel is a foot farther an American service member is from danger.\" Pending final approval in Congress, the bill would set in motion a Pentagon program to try to add more range to existing weapons using chemicals such as China Lake Compound #20, also known as CL-20, aides and people familiar with the plan told Reuters. Developed by a government laboratory in California back in the 1980s, CL-20 is one of the most discussed chemical compounds under consideration, one senior defense official said. Congress has gravitated to studies, like one published in 2021, that said repowering a rocket with CL-20 - along with other changes - could extend its range by about 20%. A paper by the Energetics Technology Center said new energetic materials give a 400-pound bomb \"the same lethality as a current 1000-pound bomb,\" adding China makes \"CL-20 on an industrial scale and built it into weapons systems.\" Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N)New Tab is one of the main makers of CL-20 in the United States. The other main rocket motor maker is Aerojet Rocketdyne which was purchased last week by L3Harris Technologies (LHX.N)New Tab . The Senate earmarked funds would be used to establish an office for energetic materials within the Department of Defense answering to the Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, according to the legislation. The office would be a coordinating body across the Army, Navy and Air Force to cut through institutional red tape. \"This relatively modest investment for energetics is a meaningful and important initiative,\" said Tom Karako, a weapons expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Karako said the cost of re-powering or using new explosive chemicals in weapons in the U.S. inventory could be in the billions of dollars, adding that the figure was heavily dependent on which weapons were re-powered, and how many were modified or purchased. Iain Overton, executive director with the nonprofit Action on Armed Violence, said the race to tweak already lethal weapons was not progress. \"History is said to repeat itself, and in the sense that arms races always end badly,\" he said. \"Does bigger, more deadly weapons make us safer? The answer is a resounding: no. In the last decade, when explosive weapons were used in populated areas, 90% of those reported killed or injured globally were civilians.\" The House version of the annual defense bill requires the Pentagon to run a CL-20 pilot program that switches out either the explosive or propellant in three existing weapons. The House version does not name any weapons, but Bob Kavetsky with the Energetics Technology Center said candidates for the new chemicals include the Lockheed Martin-made (LMT.N)New Tab long range anti-ship missiles and extended range air-to-surface missiles. Other candidates include Harpoon anti-ship missile made by Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and Javelin anti-tank weapons made by Lockheed and RTX (RTX.N)New Tab .",

China Southern Airlines (600029.SS)New Tab had been readying to receive MAX planes in January, but it plans to conduct additional safety inspections on the aircraft, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. China's aviation regulator also instructed the country's airlines to conduct precautionary safety inspections on their Boeing 737 MAX jets, the report added. Chinese airlines do not have the MAX 9 model in their fleet. The MAX 8 jets they operate lack the panel involved in the Alaska Airlines incident. Beijing is holding off from making further substantive moves as it waits for more clarity from U.S. investigations into the accident, the WSJ reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Boeing declined to comment. China Southern Airlines and China's aviation regulator did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. China suspended most orders and deliveries of Boeing planes in 2019 after 737 MAX was grounded worldwide following two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. A restart of MAX deliveries would be a major breakthrough for Boeing's relationship with China, which has been impacted by the MAX crisis and U.S.-China political tensions. It would also be a financial win for Boeing, allowing it to collect payment for dozens of Chinese MAX planes in its inventory. The company last month made its first direct delivery of a 787 Dreamliner to China since 2019, a step seen as a possible prelude to the end of Beijing's freeze on MAX deliveries. Through November, it also handed over eight 777 freighters to Chinese customers, according to Boeing data. Boeing has been virtually frozen out of new orders from China since 2017 amid Sino-U.S. trade tensions.",

The case has caused tension between Venezuela and Argentina, which on Thursday morning tried to lower the tone of the dispute by stating there was no diplomatic incident caused by the plane. Nonetheless, Argentine federal judge Federico Villena ordered the seizure of the plane at the request of the United States and despite complaints from the leftist government of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro, outlets such as Argentina's state news agency Telam reported. Agents from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations inspected the plane on Thursday afternoon, according to Argentine media. The plane, sold by Iranian company Mahan Air to Venezuelan airline Emtrasur, was immobilized in June by Argentine officials. Both Mahan Air and Emtrasur are sanctioned by the United States. The Boeing 747 had a crew of 14 Venezuelans and five Iranians at the time of its arrival in Buenos Aires. Ramon Velasquez Araguayan, Venezuela's transport minister, and a group of lawmakers met with Argentine ambassador Oscar Laborde to deliver a statement in which the airline's workers expressed their desire for the crew and aircraft to return to their country. The spokesperson for Argentina's center-left government, Gabriela Cerruti, sought Thursday to minimize apparent conflict between the two countries, saying that critical statements by Venezuelan politicians were \"expressions of different actors of Venezuelan life\" that do not imply \"a diplomatic incident.\"",

Back in 2018, Boeing received a $3.9 billion contract to build two 747-8 aircraft for use as Air Force One, to be delivered by December 2024. Boeing is heavily modifying a pair of 747s for the project.",

            "text": "Boeing (BA.N)New Tab Commercial Airplanes is tapping the sales chief who helped lead the U.S. planemaker through two major crises in recent years to oversee fractured global supply chains as the aerospace industry battles to meet resurgent jet demand. Ihssane Mounir has been named senior vice president of global supply chain, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Stan Deal said in an email to employees. Mounir was previously senior vice president of commercial sales and marketing. Deal told the company's 1,200 direct suppliers in a separate memo that Mounir would lead internal and external supply chains and integrate strategy and requirements across all programs. The decision to unite in-house fabrication and the external supply chain restores a structure used in the past and comes as the industry fights post-COVID disruption on a broad front. \"As an industry, while we are seeing strong indications of global market resilience and recovery, we are still working to drive stability and predictability in our factories,\" Deal said in the memo to suppliers, which was seen by Reuters. During an unusually long six-year stint as sales chief, Mounir helped steer Boeing through the twin crises of fatal crashes that led to the grounding of the 737 MAX and the COVID-19 pandemic - a period during which rival Airbus SE (AIR.PA)New Tab emerged as largest planemaker by number of deliveries. He made headlines in 2019 with a tentative sale of 200 MAX to British Airways owner IAG (ICAG.L)New Tab , stealing the Paris Airshow from Airbus in a deal seen as a rescue package for the floundering jetliner just as Boeing was sliding into a two-year crisis. The number of planes involved fell to 50 when the deal was finalized after the pandemic, but the original coup was credited with easing doubts over the future of Boeing's biggest cash cow. Boeing went on to sell 1,300 MAX jets under Mounir since the lifting of the safety ban, offsetting a slew of cancellations, although Airbus still leads the coveted top of the segment. Industry sources have said Boeing is also poised to sell 190 MAX and 30 larger 787s as part of a fleet shake-up involving a total close to 500 jets at Air India, roughly split with Airbus. Among other moves, Deal said Brad McMullen, vice president of commercial sales North America, would succeed Mounir in his sales position while Kim Smith was named to the new role of vice president of Boeing Global Services (BGS) Total Quality. McMullen has for several years driven strategically important accounts in Boeing's home market, where United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab last week ordered 100 MAX and 100 787s, again upstaging Airbus whose own United order for 45 A350s now looks uncertain. Former aerodynamicist Mounir must now deal with separate turmoil in supply chains that have been disrupted by the factory bottlenecks and labor shortages seen worldwide post-COVID. Deal told reporters last week that Boeing faces a number of supply-chain issues. \"One thing that we're going to be very mindful of is to make sure we run a disciplined (production) ramp-up,\" he said.",

The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) said Saturday an overnight bargaining session had led to the new Boeing offer. The union represents about 2,500 employees at the three plants. Under the new contract offerNew Tab , employees can opt to receive an $8,000 lump sum payment - minus tax withholdings - upon ratification or can choose to have the entire amount deposited in a 401(k) plan. The company is dropping its revised 401(k) match proposal. The union local said in a web posting that if the contract is rejected, a strike would begin just at 12:01 a.m. Thursday.

The standoff began after the union had criticized Boeing's proposed 401(k) payments in the contract offer and workers rejected it. \"Boeing previously took away a pension from our members, and now the company is unwilling to adequately compensate our members' 401(k) plan,\" IAM said on July 24.",

Based on these airlines, the number of 737 MAX returning to commerical service reached 43, accounting for approximately 45% of the Chinese 737 MAX fleet, the company also said in a social media post on its official WeChat account. The best-selling Boeing model was grounded in March 2019 after fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, but returned to service around the world starting in late 2020 after modifications to the aircraft and pilot training. China is the last major market to resume flying the MAX amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States, and the return comes as domestic travel demand rebounds after China abandoned zero-COVID policies. Foreign airlines began flying the MAX to China in October 2022. In January, China Southern Airlines flew from Guangzhou to Zhengzhou using a MAX plane, marking the plane's first passenger flight in China in nearly four years. Boeing did not name who the 11 airlines were but carriers including Hainan Airlines Holding Co Ltd (600221.SS)New Tab , Fuzhou Airlines, Lucky Air and Air China (601111.SS)New Tab have flown the jets in the months since. The U.S. planemaker also said it has upgraded a flight training device for the 737 MAX jet in Shanghai to help with pilot training. \"The move reaffirms our commitment to our civil aircraft customers in China,\" said Sherry Carbary, president of Boeing China. \"The equipment upgrade allows us to further enhance our support for Chinese 737 MAX customers as they expand the aircraft's operations in and around China.\"",

The tech-heavy Nasdaq was also up but lagged the Dow and S&P 500's gains, facing early headwinds from chipmakers mainly due to a slide in Nvidia (NVDA.O)New Tab .

            "text": "U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said on Wednesday called on Congress to modernize the Cold War-era law that former President Donald Trump used to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, and vowed to address longstanding labor rights problems in Mexico. In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, Tai said that the authorities under Section 232 of the Trade Act of 1962, were not necessarily well-suited to the need to protect U.S. steelmakers from foreign competition and this has \"roiled\" the U.S. economy and heightened tensions with trading partners. Section 232 allows tariffs on goods deemed important to U.S. national security. Tai said the Trump administration and her predecessor, Robert Lighthizer, \"did the best that they could, given the tools that we have existing on the books.\" Today's problem in the steel and aluminum industry are caused largely by subsidized excess production capacity in China, and new trade law tools are needed to deal with those challenges. \"What I would propose is that we need 2021 tools for addressing the 2021 challenges we have, rather than relying on 1962 tools and retrofitting them for the challenges we have now,\" Tai said, adding that the Finance Committee could help level the playing field for new workers. Tai did not discuss specific changes to the statute. The European Union is threatening to double tariffs on Harley-Davidson (HOG.N)New Tab motorcycles, American made whiskey and power boats to 50% on June 1 if a transatlantic dispute over the steel and aluminum tariffs is not resolved by then. read more Tai said she was having \"constructive discussions\" with the EU and Britain to address excess capacity in the steel and aluminum sectors, as well as on resolving a long-running Boeing-Airbus subsidy dispute. \"These talks will take time, but I believe a resolution is possible and worth pursuing,\" Tai said in prepared remarks. Tai said she will use the new factory-specific labor enforcement provisions of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade to address longstanding labor issues in Mexico. USTR earlier on Wednesday requested that the Mexican government review allegations that worker rights were denied in a union vote at a General Motors (GM.N)New Tab truck plant in Mexico under the USMCA's \"rapid response\" labor enforcement provisions. read more \"This use of the rapid response mechanism demonstrates that we will act when workers in certain facilities are denied their rights under laws necessary to fulfill Mexico’s labor obligations,\" Tai said. She said the USMCA, which last year replaced the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, has \"the most comprehensive, enforceable labor and environmental standards of any U.S. trade agreement\". Tai defended her decision to engage in World Trade Organization negotiations on a waiver of intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines, saying this could make drug companies \"heroes\". read more",

Israel's flag carrier, which has a fleet of 46 aircraft split between long and short haul, removed seats from one of its six Boeing 777-200 planes to add up to 50 tonnes of cargo per flight. It also added a Boeing 737 that was recently converted to cargo to its fleet and, with cargo capacity of 20 tonnes, will make two flights a day to various European destinations. It chose 222 as its flight number since it has a numerical value of Israel's slogan of \"together we will win.\" El Al chief executive Dina Ben Tal Ganancia said the airline flew about a quarter of a million passengers to and from Israel in the first two weeks of the conflict that began on Oct. 7 when Hamas launched an attack from Gaza on the south of the country. Israel has since bombarded Gaza with the goal of eliminating the militant group. \"With the decrease in demand for passenger flights, the need to fly cargo has increased,\" Ben Tal Ganancia said, noting that until now El Al has relied on cargo capacity of passenger planes. The airline, it said, has boosted cargo capacity on passenger aircraft and has flown more than 5,000 tonnes of cargo to Israel, including medical and vital equipment - some of which was donated by various organisations and Jewish communities around the world. El Al said special flights were operated to fly equipment that included first aid kits, additional medical supplies, as well as cargo that included thermal clothing for soldiers and equipment purchased for the families near Gaza. As part of its increase in cargo flights, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner flew on Tuesday to Mumbai - the first time in four years an El Al plane landed in India. El Al is among very few airlines flying to Israel since most carriers have halted flights to Tel Aviv.",

More than 1,000 companies from more than 50 countries are participating in the biennial commercial and defence-focused Singapore Airshow, led by Western industry giants such as Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab , Boeing and Lockheed Martin (LMT.N)New Tab and their Chinese competitors such as COMAC and AVIC. Russian companies such as Russian Helicopters and Irkut that attended past editions of the show are not participating this year amid the war in Ukraine. However, Israeli companies Israel Aerospace Industries and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which dropped out of the Dubai Airshow in November amid the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, are in attendance. Trade delegates donned hats and sunglasses on a hot, clear day to watch flying displays featuring military aircraft from Singapore, Australia, India, Indonesia, South Korea and the United States, as well as the COMAC C919 commercial jet and an Airbus A350-1000 powered by 35% sustainable aviation fuel. COMAC, which brought its self-developed C919 narrow-body jet outside Chinese territory for the first time to the show, posted the first aircraft orders of the event on Tuesday morning, with China's Tibet Airlines finalising an order for 40 C919 single-aisle planes and 10 ARJ21 regional jets, and China's Henan Civil Aviation Development and Investment Group ordering 6 ARJ21s. Royal Brunei Airlines later announced a firm order for four Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, while the U.S. planemaker also held a signing ceremony to mark a recently placed order for 45 of the wide-body planes by Thai Airways (THAI.BK)New Tab . Given its timing early in the year, there are typically fewer major order announcements at the Singapore air show than at its counterparts in Paris, Farnborough and Dubai. By the end of 2023, travel demand had made a near-full recovery from pre-pandemic levels in 2019, with domestic travel running 4% higher than pre-COVID levels and the international market lagging at 88% mostly because of China's slower rebound, according to International Air Transport Association data. \"We see 2024 as a real return to normal,\" said Steven Townend, the CEO of Singapore-based aircraft lessor BOC Aviation (2588.HK)New Tab . \"The industry is growing, airlines are making money again on a global basis. For 2024, we're really positive.\" Major suppliers, planemakers and engine producers have struggled to keep up with the rebound in demand after the sharp downturn during COVID-19 led to job losses, freight snarls and an industry skills shortage. Boeing, in particular, is under scrutiny after the mid-air blowout of a cabin panel on an Alaska Airlines (ALK.N)New Tab 737 MAX on Jan. 5 led the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to take the unprecedented step of freezing production of its best-selling single-aisle plane at 38 per month. Airbus this month announced a further delay in entry to service of its long-range A321XLR single-aisle jet to the third quarter from the second. Suppliers told Reuters that Airbus is producing about 50 A320neo family jets a month compared with a production plan that had foreseen 58 by end-2023. Christian Scherer, the CEO of Airbus' commercial aircraft business, said on Tuesday there were many \"pinch points\" in the aerospace supply chain. \"The production ramp-up is putting pressure into the supply chain everywhere and it is our job to tackle it,\" he told reporters, adding that Airbus had deployed several dozen supply chain engineers to unlock bottlenecks. The production issues are delaying the ability of airlines to replace older jets with more fuel-efficient models as the industry looks to meet its goal of \"net zero\" emissions by 2050. Airlines are also looking to buy as much sustainable aviation fuel as possible to reduce their carbon emissions, even though it costs up to five times as much as conventional jet fuel. In Singapore, travellers will bear the cost of the transition towards green jet fuel, its transport minister said on Monday, as he announced the city-state's plans for a levy on departing flight ticket prices from 2026.",

In the first half of the year, Spirit took about $215 million in charges on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A220 and A350 programs, due to wage inflation, parts shortages and greater regulatory scrutiny, he said at an investor conference. \"All of those programs are under pressure,\" he noted. \"And it really is not sustainable for Spirit. So we are having discussions with our customers, with Boeing and Airbus, about these pressures that we're facing and how we address them.\" Spirit shares closed down 7.3%. Spirit executives first alluded to the need to reopen contract negotiations with Boeing and Airbus in August. Gentile on Thursday pointed to \"disappointing\" Airbus A220 production rates, noting that only 65 to 70 jets are likely to be made this year instead of the 100 Spirit had expected to build wings and other parts for. Spirit previously forecast the program would break even or begin to be profitable in 2025 after hitting a monthly production rate of 14 A220s per month. That timeframe appears to have been delayed \"and we need to have that discussion with Airbus,\" he said, noting similar talks about the A350. Spirit is also discussing the Dreamliner program with Boeing, Gentile said, as the parts maker has logged $1.4 billion in reach-forward losses and needs relief to ramp up 787 production to Boeing's target of 10 per month by 2026. \"With both Boeing and Airbus, we've been an open book in terms of sharing all of the cost data so they understand and know that we've been working on different opportunities (to cut costs) and have exhausted those,\" he said.",

            "text": "Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab delivered 40 jets in August to bring supplies of its new jets to 384 since the start of the year, remaining broadly on course to meet an annual goal of 600 deliveries that would preserve its crown as no.1 aircraft manufacturer. The European planemaker also sold 269 planes in the first eight months of the year, or 132 after cancellations, company data showed on Tuesday. Fresh sales included 28 narrowbody jets to Latam Airlines (LTM.SN)New Tab , though South America's largest carrier simultaneously cancelled an order for two A350-1000 wide-body jets. On deliveries, which drive most aerospace revenues, Airbus remains well ahead of U.S. rival Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab which is gradually clearing a backlog of undelivered jets following the almost two-year safety grounding of its 737 MAXNew Tab . However, after a lull caused by the MAX crisis and then the industry-wide impact of COVID-19, Boeing remains ahead in the number of new orders as U.S. carriers renew their fleets. As of the end of July, Boeing had sold 630 planes or 270 after adjusting for actual and possible cancellations. Orders included more than 524 Boeing 737 MAX by the end of July, compared to Airbus's Jan-August tally of 234 A320-family jets. Boeing nonetheless took a knock from one of its largest customers on Monday when Ryanair (RYA.I)New Tab said it had halted talksNew Tab to buy up to 250 of the largest variant, the 737 MAX 10, because of a difference with Boeing over prices. read more On Tuesday, Boeing shares fell over 2%. While the coronavirus pandemic has upended many assumptions about the travel industry, analysts cautioned a shock defection by Ryanair to Airbus faces numerous obstacles. The European firm already has a long waiting list for its competing A321neo and it claims to be commanding higher prices, meaning a price war over Ryanair could upset existing customers. Airbus dominates the large single-aisle segment at the centre of the Ryanair-Boeing standoff, while the U.S. planemaker has been leading contests against the smaller A320. After the unusual public spat, Ryanair and Boeing are widely expected to wait each other out before seeing in which direction COVID pushes the battered aviation market this winter, with most market sources predicting a compromise deal next year. But in a reminder of the unusual row involving its rival, Airbus data issued on Tuesday confirmed the sale of 36 A321neo jets to Boeing customer Jet2 - a move that much larger Ryanair has held up as evidence that Boeing needs to cut prices further. Boeing responded on Monday that it would maintain a disciplined approach in airplane negotiations. read more",

            "title": "U.S. business equipment spending strong even as new orders flat in July",
            "text": "New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods were unexpectedly flat in July amid supply constraints and a shift in demand to services, suggesting that business spending on equipment could slow in the second half after robust growth over the past year. Still, business investment in equipment remains strong, with the report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing shipments of these capital goods accelerating last month. Orders are 18% above their pre-pandemic levels. Investment in equipment is expected to help offset cooling consumer spending and keep the economy on a solid growth path this quarter. \"Overall, the July data point to solid equipment spending growth at the start of third quarter,\" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. \"But with producer prices running hot and the recovery tilting in favor of high-contact services, we're likely to see a gradual moderation in real equipment spending growth in the second half of 2021.\" Last month's unchanged reading in orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, followed an upwardly revised 1.0% increase in June. These so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have advanced 0.7%. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders climbing 0.5%. Shipments of core capital goods rose 1.0% last month after increasing 0.6% in June. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower. Business spending on equipment notched four straight quarters of double-digit growth, helping to power the economy's recovery from a short and sharp COVID-19 pandemic recession, driven by strong demand for goods, thanks to record-low interest rates and massive fiscal stimulus. July's slowdown in core capital goods orders likely reflected supply chain bottlenecks as well as the rotation of spending back to services from goods. There were decreases in orders for computers and electronic products. An ongoing global semiconductor shortage has hampered production of these goods. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components also fell. But orders for primary metals, machinery and fabricated metal products increased. VERY LEAN INVENTORIES With inventories extremely lean after they were depleted in the first half of the year, core capital goods orders are likely to pick up in the coming months and underpin manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy. Unfilled core capital goods orders increased 0.9% in July after rising 1.2% in June. \"As production has not kept up with demand but demand has remained persistently strong, we would expect strong demand to keep production supported well into 2022 as supply issues are eventually resolved,\" said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup in New York. The resilience is welcome amid signs that consumer spending is cooling as the Delta variant of the coronavirus causes a resurgence in new infections across the country. Retail sales fell in July in part because of motor vehicle shortages. Credit card data suggests spending on services like airfares, cruises as well as hotels and motels has been slowing. Economists at Goldman Sachs last week cut their third-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 5.5% annualized rate from a 9% pace. Bank of America Securities slashed its GDP growth estimate for this quarter to a 4.5% pace from a 7.0% rate. The economy grew at a 6.5% rate in the second quarter, pulling the level of GDP above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019. Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, dipped 0.1% in July after rising 0.8% in June. They were pulled down by a 2.2% decline in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 1.4% increase in June. Orders for civilian aircraft tumbled 48.9%. Boeing (BA.N)New Tab reported on its website that it had received 31 aircraft orders last month compared to 219 in June. Orders for motor vehicles and parts rose 5.8% in July after climbing 1.8% in June. Automakers have been adjusting their production schedules, including foregoing annual plant shutdowns for retooling in July, to manage their chip supply. That likely contributed to the jump in motor vehicle orders last month. \"Make no mistake, auto-production is still struggling to keep up with demand,\" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina.",

Called Arc Sport, it is priced at $258,000 and comes about two years after the company, which declined to give its valuation, launched a $300,000 premium speedboat, Arc One. Arc Sport is 23-feet long and can accommodate 15 persons. It has a 226 kilowatt-hour battery and is powered by a 570 horsepower motor, while its software can be updated over the air. It can be reserved for $500 from Tuesday and will be delivered later this year. \"Our first mass-market boat builds on the success of the Arc One, and is targeted at the wake sport industry due to strong demand at premium price points,\" CEO Mitch Lee told Reuters. Lee said two of the best-selling models in the industry have an average sales price of about $250,000 and many others sell for more than $300,000. Premium speedboat, Arc One, which had a smaller battery with lesser power and passenger capacity, was sold out, the company, which was founded in 2021 by former Boeing engineers Lee and Ryan Cook, said. Cook worked at the planemaker and later was a lead engineer at Elon Musk's rocket maker SpaceX. The startup's seed round, which closed in February 2021, was led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Later that year it added Will Smith's Dreamers VC and Durant's 35V as investors.

Riyadh Air is owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which has more than $620 billion in assets under management. Chief Executive Tony Douglas said the owners would impose strict financial expectations, which he did not specify. Douglas was speaking at an event to present the airline on the eve of the Paris Airshow. It is launching at a time when airlines are under pressure to meet industry emission targets, with some facing legal pressure over alleged greenwashing. \"Ultimately it will be commercial aviation sustainability that will differentiate the winners and the losers, and anyone who doesn't take it seriously will probably fail for sure,\" Douglas said. The creation of a second Saudi national airline was announced alongside a provisional order for up to 72 Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 787s in March, as oil producer Saudi Arabia diversifies its economy. Douglas ruled out any further aircraft announcements at this week's show. However, industry sources said Riyadh Air was likely to sign a deal with General Electric (GE.N)New Tab for engines to power the recently ordered Dreamliners. Riyadh Air declined to comment. GE, which competes with Britain's Rolls-Royce (RR.L)New Tab to power the wide-body jets, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Douglas said Riyadh Air continued to conduct a contest between Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and Boeing for narrowbody jets. The airline plans to show a 787 this week painted in the airline's new indigo livery. Douglas declined to give details of the airline's cabin product which he said would be rolled out progressively. But he said it would involve an \"obsessional\" level of attention to detail, aided by systems to track passenger preferences closer to Amazon (AMZN.O)New Tab or Spotify (SPOT.N)New Tab than typical airlines. Riyadh Air is launching flights in 2025 in a region whose carriers have well-established brands for high service levels. Qatar Airways last year won Skytrax airline of the year for the seventh year in a row and Emirates last month topped the Business Traveller Middle East awards for a tenth time. Douglas said it was easier to incorporate the latest digital customisation from scratch without starting with legacy systems. That echoes claims by Air India, whose systems are so antiquated that its new CEO has said its relaunch amounts to a clean sheet. Asked whether Riyadh Air would serve alcohol in its cabins amid Saudi Arabia's strict laws on drinking, Douglas said the airline would always follow any laws that applied.",

Girardi had requestedNew Tab a February 2025 trial date. Federal prosecutors wanted Girardi's trialNew Tab to start in March or April of this year. A spokesperson for the Los Angeles U.S. Attorney's Office declined to comment further. Girardi's federal public defenders did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the scheduling order from U.S. District Judge Josephine Staton. Girardi, the estranged husband of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Erika Jayne Girardi and once one of the country's most prominent plaintiffs' lawyers, is facing five counts of wire fraud in Los Angeles, and eight counts of wire fraud and four counts of criminal contempt of court in a separate case pending in Chicago. Both cases center on accusations that Girardi stole client funds. He has pleaded not guilty. Staton, in a 52-page rulingNew Tab unsealed on Friday, said she was persuaded by the government's arguments that Girardi had exaggerated symptoms of dementia to avoid standing trial. She noted that Girardi moderated a panel in November 2020, days before he was accused of stealing millions of dollars in settlement funds from the families of the victims of the 2018 Boeing 737 MAX Lion Air Flight 610 crash in Indonesia. It wasn't until a Dec. 14, 2020, contempt hearing in Chicago federal court that \"the very first claim of ongoing mental impairment arose,\" Staton said. Thirteen days after that hearing, Girardi called Chicago-based plaintiffs' lawyer Jay Edelson, whose law firm brought the missing Lion Air funds to light, to try to resolve the dispute, Staton said. The judge called Girardi's claims of cognitive impairment \"highly inconsistent\" with his actions in 2020 and 2021. Girardi's legal and personal affairs are now handled by his brother Robert, a dentist. Robert Girardi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Girardi's Chicago case has largely been held in limbo while that court awaited the outcome of his competency proceedings in Los Angeles. A status hearing in the Chicago case is set for Jan. 18. Christopher Kamon, the former chief financial officer of Girardi's now-defunct law firm Girardi Keese, was also charged in the Chicago and Los Angeles cases. Kamon's trial is also now set for May 21. Girardi's son-in-law, David Lira, who worked at the firm, was charged with wire fraud and criminal contempt of court by the Chicago prosecutors. The case is United States v.

Reuters first reported Friday the NTSB was assisting the Civil Aviation Administration of China with the download of the cockpit voice recorder at the U.S. lab in Washington. NTSB had repeatedly declined to answer questions about the status of the flight data recorder until Tuesday when it confirmed assistance with that recorder as well. The plane crashed into a mountainside in southern China on March 21 killing all 132 on board. It was mainland China's deadliest aviation disaster in 28 years. Heading to coastal Guangzhou from the southwestern city of Kunming, the plane dove from cruising altitude around the time it should have started its landing descent. The flight data recorder could shed light on the cause of the crash. The flight briefly appeared to pull out of its nosedive before resuming its plunge to earth, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24. Its data showed the aircraft was plummeting 31,000 feet per minute. The pilots did not respond to repeated calls from air traffic controllers and nearby planes during the rapid descent, authorities said. The cockpit voice recorder will likely provide investigators with details of communications between the flight's three pilots, which is one more than is normally required on board the Boeing (BA.N)New Tab plane. On Saturday, a team of three NTSB investigators arrived in China to assist in the crash probe. The NTSB also said Friday a small team from Boeing was traveling to China to assist in the investigation. On Thursday, Chinese state media said the cause of the crash must be determined as soon as possible, following a meeting of China's highest decision-making body helmed by President Xi Jinping.",

            "text": "Boeing's (BA.N)New Tab first direct delivery of a 787 Dreamliner to China since 2019 landed in Shanghai on Friday, a step that could hasten the end of China's freeze on deliveries of the firm's profitable 737 MAX after more than four years. Privately owned Chinese carrier Juneyao Airlines on Thursday took delivery of the 787-9 aircraft, which Boeing said then departed for China from Everett Paine Field in Washington state. The flight landed in Shanghai around 4:20 p.m. local time (0820 GMT), the airline said. China suspended most orders and deliveries of Boeing planes in 2019 after the 737 MAX was grounded worldwide following two fatal crashes. A restart of MAX deliveries would represent a reset of Boeing's relationship with China and create an opportunity for the company to offload dozens of planes in its inventory, and pave the way for a larger breakthrough in deliveries and orders. The company expects China to account for 20% of the world's aircraft demands through to 2042. Boeing last delivered a leased Dreamliner plane to a Chinese customer in 2021, but no 787s have been handed over directly to Chinese airlines since November 2019. Analysts had forecast the resumption of Dreamliner deliveries to China after consultancy AAP/AIR this month reported preparatory flight activities for a 787 designated for Juneyao Airlines, registered as B-20EQ. Twelve of the 60 undelivered 787s in Boeing's inventory are dedicated for Chinese operators, analysts Jefferies said. Boeing's business with Chinese airlines could be affected by the political ties between Washington and Beijing, which have recently improved. Last month, U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first face-to-face talks in a year, and on Thursday the top U.S. military officer spoke to his Chinese counterpart in the first such conversation in over a year. On Wednesday, trade publication The Air Current said Boeing had this month won a key clearance from regulator the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) allowing the planemaker to prepare MAX aircraft for delivery. The safety bans have been lifted as existing MAX planes are flying inside China, but new deliveries have remained on hold. The CAAC's deputy head on Dec. 8 told a Boeing executive in Beijing the planemaker was welcome to deepen its development in the Chinese market, Reuters reported. The Air Current, citing unidentified sources, said the regulator's clearance was granted that day. Individual MAX deliveries to China still need approval from China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the Air Current report said. Boeing told Reuters it is ready to deliver to customers \"when that time comes\". The CAAC and NDRC did not respond to requests for comment. A 737 MAX designated for China Southern Airlines (600029.SS)New Tab flew from Boeing Field in Seattle to Boeing's nearby facility in Moses Lake, Washington, and back on Wednesday afternoon, according to data from flight tracking website FlightRadar24. Analysts from Jefferies and Deutsche Bank said in investor notes that it appeared to be a customer acceptance flight - a test flight operated by an airline pilot that occurs before delivery. MAX deliveries to China could provide some upside to Boeing's $10 billion free cash flow target for 2025-2026, as that projection did not factor in potential deliveries to China, analysts say.",

An en banc panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 6-5 rulingNew Tab said The Gap can enforce a corporate bylaw requiring shareholder derivative litigation to be filed in Delaware Chancery Court, even when it blocks federal securities claims that can only be heard in federal court. The ruling cements a split among federal appeals courts on how forum selection provisions apply to derivative suits alleging violations of the federal Securities and Exchange Act. Last year, the 7th Circuit said Boeing Co could not enforce a forum selection provision mandating that derivative claims be filed in Delaware Chancery Court. The court's six Republican-appointed judges rejected claims by Gap shareholder Noelle Lee that enforcing the forum selection clause would allow the company to avoid any litigation and effectively waive its obligations under federal securities law. The Gap, which is based in San Francisco, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nor did Lee's lawyers at Bottini & Bottini, which has brought similar shareholder lawsuits against Google parent Alphabet Inc, Oracle Corp, Qualcomm Inc and other companies. Those companies have denied wrongdoing. Lee in a 2020 lawsuit in San Francisco federal court said The Gap had failed to make progress in diversifying its senior leadership despite making statements to the contrary in securities filings. The Gap has maintained that the allegations in the lawsuit are \"offensive, racially charged and demonstrably false.\" U.S. District Judge Sallie Kim in 2021 said the forum selection clause was enforceable and dismissed the case, and a 9th Circuit panel affirmed last year. The court granted en banc review and vacated the panel ruling in October. Lee's lawyers argued that the forum clause was unenforceable because it violated a provision in the Securities and Exchange Act barring corporate directors from waiving their legal obligations. On Thursday, Circuit Judge Sandra Ikuta wrote for the majority that the law only bars the waiver of substantive legal obligations imposed on company directors, and \"not the waiver of a particular procedure for enforcing such duties.\" Ikuta said that shareholders will not be barred from suing because they can still file lawsuits on their own behalf in federal court, rather than derivative lawsuits on behalf of a company. But Circuit Judge Sidney Thomas, who penned the dissenting opinion, called The Gap's forum selection clause \"a litigation bridge to nowhere\" that deprives shareholders of any forum to pursue derivative claims. \"The majority’s contrary conclusion renders the Exchange Act's protections meaningless,\" Thomas wrote. Thomas and the judges who joined him all are appointees of Democratic presidents. The case is Lee v. Fisher, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-15923.

            "text": "The CEO of Saudi Arabia's newest airline Riyadh Air said on Monday it would announce a very large order for narrow-body aircraft \"in a number of weeks' time\" after reviewing bids by Airbus and Boeing. The airline, owned by the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, said last week it had concluded its narrowbody campaign and was expected to announce the order soon, although no specific timeframe has so far been given. \"(The) process has concluded,\" Tony Douglas told Reuters at the Dubai Airshow on Monday. \"In a number of weeks' time, we will reveal a sizable order of narrow-body aircraft.\" Douglas, the former CEO of Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways, declined to say how many aircraft Riyadh Air would order, or when. The company has already provisionally ordered 72 Boeing 787 widebody jets. The airline joins a crowded and competitive market in the Gulf, with established carriers like Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad all jostling for space. Douglas said it would not clash with other Gulf carriers as the majority of their business comes from transfer traffic, whereas most of Riyadh Air's will come from point to point flights to and from Saudi Arabia. \"One national carrier simply doesn't have the capacity to provide anything like the demand that's out there,\" he said. Saudi Arabia's existing airlines include state-owned Saudia, its low-cost unit flyadeal, and flynas. Riyadh Air plans to enter the debt market next year. \"That will probably be a combination of traditional debt and sustainable securities,\" he added. The airline has hired 150 staff, including 20 pilots, Chief Operating Officer Peter Bellew also told Reuters on Monday, adding it aimed to operate about 170 aircraft by 2030.",

            "text": "Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab is preparing the ground for further delays to planned delivery dates of some medium-haul aircraft in 2023 even as it races to meet delivery targets for 2022 in the face of supply chain and labour problems, three industry sources said. The twin-speed approach comes as uncertainty remains over supplies of engines for new plane production as well as other parts and labour, they added, asking not to be named. A spokesperson for Airbus said it had no comment on deliveries ahead of its next monthly bulletin in early December. Analysts say aerospace is grappling with a series of concurrent problems with multiple knock-on effects. Jetliner and engine makers are battling supply chain and labour problems, but so too are the worldwide repair shops needed to help airlines meet a sharper than expected recovery in demand by keeping their existing aircraft in service. The logjam in repair capacity has left dozens of planes grounded as their engines are late coming out of overhaul, and that in turn has created competition for engines between new aircraft assembly lines and spares for the existing fleet. At least one engine maker is experiencing renewed pressure to shift more engines away from supporting aircraft production to a pool of spares for existing customers, the sources said. Airbus produces A320-neo family jets with a choice of engines from General Electric (GE.N)New Tab and Safran (SAF.PA)New Tab joint venture CFM International or Raytheon Technologies (RTX.N)New Tab unit Pratt & Whitney. Boeing uses solely CFM for its 737 family. Data showing how many jets are unused because of maintenance delays as opposed to economic or other reasons is not available. But there are signs the total number of parked A320neo-family jets has risen since early this year, led by Pratt versions, even as demand for travel on such aircraft has been increasing. Currently some 129 Pratt-powered Airbus jets and 55 fitted with CFM's LEAP engines are parked, according to Ascend by Cirium's head of global consulting Rob Morris. Neither engine maker had any immediate comment. In October, Airbus and Safran struck a more upbeat note on recently disrupted engine supplies than Boeing, which said during quarterly earnings that engines were its main constraint. At the same time, engine industry sources insist snags on their side of the fence are not solely to blame for delays. One executive denied any additional pressure on engine supplies. Jetmakers have been facing difficulties getting other parts on time including galleys and lavatories, one executive said. In July, Airbus said it would reach an interim production goal of 65 A320-family narrow-body jets a month in early 2024 instead of summer 2023. It targets 75 a month in 2025.",

            "text": "Aircraft leasing firms are set to terminate hundreds of leases with Russian airlines following Western sanctions over the invasion of UkraineNew Tab that give the sector a month to act. Dublin-based AerCap (AER.N)New Tab , the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, saw its New York-listed shares tumble 12.7% after it said it would cease leasing activity with Russian carriers, while U.S.-based Air Lease (AL.N)New Tab fell almost 8%. Russian airlines have 980 passenger jets in service, of which 777 are leased, according to analytics firm Cirium. Of these, two-thirds, or 515 jets, with an estimated market value of about $10 billion, are rented from foreign firms. AerCap said that by net book value, 5% of its fleet was leased in Russia as of Dec. 31. The company, which recently strengthened its leadership of the specialist aviation leasing industry by buying rival GECAS, has the largest exposure to Russia and Ukraine with 152 planes, consultancy IBA said. Its Russian clients include Aeroflot, S7 Airlines, Rossiya, Azur Air and Ural Airlines, its website showed, involving aircraft worth an estimated $2.5 billion, according to aviation services firm ACC Aviation. Leasing companies control about half of the world's fleet and are a vital source of financing for airlines that lack sufficient capital to buy or prefer to pay a monthly rent. The European Union on Sunday gave leasing companies until March 28 to wind up current rental contracts in Russia, presenting lessors with a major new headache hard on the heels of crises over Boeing 737 MAX safety and the COVID-19 pandemic. Russia warned the West it would retaliate against sanctions targeting its aviation industry. Bankers have said Russian airlines have been among the most reliable in paying bills during the pandemic, but leasing companies face the prospect of having to abruptly wind up deals and recover aircraft in an uncertain climate post-sanctions. Russia is a member of the Cape Town Convention, a specialist but vital treaty underpinning the fast-growing air finance industry by making it easier for lessors to recover jets when airlines cannot pay, in return for cheaper finance for airlines. But the cooperation of courts is often still needed to enforce the rules and it remains unclear how Russia's courts would react to a request to recover jets under sanctions. ACC Aviation Vice President Viktor Berta said repossessing aircraft could prove challenging, especially if Russian aviation authorities and airlines do not cooperate with lessors. Given the airspace bans, even sending staff to Russia to repossess aircraft could also be a headache, Berta added. Financial restrictions may also prove a burden. Avolon, the world's second-biggest leasing company, has fewer than 20 airplanes in Russia and one or two in Ukraine out of a total fleet of more than 550 aircraft, CEO Domhnal Slattery told Reuters this month. read more Slattery said at the time that Avolon was concerned that sanctions on international payment transfers through SWIFT could be disrupted, making it hard for airlines to pay their bills. Avolon declined to comment when asked about the sanctions. G7 leaders said on Sunday that Western allies had decided to cut off \"certain Russian banks\" from the SWIFT secure messaging system to ensure rapid cross-border payments, which has become the principal mechanism to finance international trade. read more Lessor BOC Aviation (2588.HK)New Tab said it had 18 planes representing 4.5% of its owned fleet based in Russia. It also manages one other plane. \"Our policy is to fully comply with all laws applicable to our business,\" BOC Aviation said in a statement. \"The practical consequences of the new EU sanctions are complex and at the present time we are unable to provide further information.\" Dubai Aerospace Enterprise (DAE) has at least three Russian airline customers, including Aeroflot, according to its website. The Dubai-owned lessor did not respond to a request for comment. Novus Aviation Capital Co-Chief Executive Mounir Kuzbari told Reuters the firm has no aircraft in Russia but that mass cancellation of leases in Russia could hit global lease rates and aircraft values.",

Amazon's satellite internet unit, Project Kuiper, will begin mass-producing the satellites later this year, the company said. Those will be the first of over 3,000 satellites the technology giant plans to launch in low-Earth orbit in the next few years. \"We'll definitely be beta testing with commercial customers in 2024,\" Dave Limp, senior vice president of Amazon devices, said at a conference in Washington. The 2024 deployment target would keep Amazon on track to fulfill a regulatory mandate to launch half its entire Kuiper network of 3,236 satellites by 2026. Limp, who oversees Amazon's consumer devices powerhouse, said the company plans to make \"three to five\" satellites a day to reach that goal. With plans to pump more than $10 billion into the Kuiper network, Amazon sees its experience producing millions of devices from its consumer electronics powerhouse as an edge over rival SpaceX, the Musk-owned space company whose Starlink network already has roughly 4,000 satellites in space. Amazon plans to launch a pair of prototype satellites early this year aboard a new rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance. The 2024 launch, carrying the initial production satellites, is expected to be the first of many more in a swift deployment campaign using rockets Amazon procured in 2021 and 2022. The company on Tuesday also revealed a slate of three different terminals, or antennas, that will connect customers with its Kuiper satellites in orbit. The \"standard customer terminal,\" 11-inch square antennas, will cost the company less than $400 each to produce and provide internet speeds of 400 megabits per second for customers, Amazon said in a statement. SpaceX's consumer Starlink terminals, priced at $599 each, as well as other bespoke terminals for governments and businesses, are being used by \"more than a million customers to date,\" Jonathan Hofeller, SpaceX's head of Starlink enterprise sales, said Monday. A smaller, square-shaped mobile antenna, measuring 7 inches wide and weighing one pound, will be Amazon's \"most affordable\" terminal for the network, though the company did not disclose the price. Amazon's largest, \"most capable\" antenna model, \"designed for enterprise, government and telecommunications applications,\" will be 19 by 30 inches in size and put out internet speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second - fast enough to download a high-definition feature-length movie in roughly 30 seconds.",

Boeing first filed with the FCC in 2017 seeking approval to deploy a V-band Constellation of mostly low-Earth orbit satellites. Boeing said this week it \"sees a multi-orbit future for satellite technologies. As the demand for satellite communications grows, diversity will be required across orbital regimes and frequencies to satisfy unique customer demands.\"",

The equipment would be funded using Presidential Drawdown Authority, or PDA, in which the president can authorize the transfer of articles and services from U.S. stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency. One of the officials said final determinations were still being made about the mix of equipment. A senior congressional aide said the equipment to be announced would likely include heavy ground artillery systems to Ukraine, including howitzers. White House officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House said last week that it has provided more than $1.7 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine that Russia calls a \"special military operation.\"The congressional aide said some lawmakers had been informed within the last 24 hours about the upcoming announcement, which was expected within the next 24 to 48 hours. Weapons shipments have included defensive anti-aircraft Stinger and anti-tank Javelin missiles, as well as ammunition and body armor. U.S. and European leaders are being pressed by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to provide heavier arms and equipment to engage Russia in Ukraine's eastern region, where Russia is expected to intensify its military efforts. Raytheon Technologies (RTX.N)New Tab and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N)New Tab jointly produce Javelins, while Raytheon makes Stingers. Other top weapons makers are Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab , Northrop Grumman (NOC.N)New Tab , General Dynamics (GD.N)New Tab and L3Harris Technologies (LHX.N)New Tab .

            "text": "Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N)New Tab will suspend factory production on Thursday at its plant in Wichita, Kansas, the company said, after workers rejected a proposed four-year deal and announced a strike to begin on June 24. Spirit is one of the most consequential suppliers for aerospace heavyweights Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab . The Wichita site makes the entire fuselage for Boeing's bestselling 737 MAX narrowbody jet and the forward sections for most of its other aircraft, as well as pylons for the Airbus A220. Shares of Spirit tumbled about 9% in afternoon trade, while those of Boeing fell 2.4%. Paris-listed shares of Airbus shed 1.7%. A prolonged work stoppage at Spirit could have ripple effects for the aircraft makers it supplies, eventually forcing them to slow or stop jetliner assembly at a time when both Airbus and Boeing are ramping up production. \"It's not a welcome development,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with AeroDynamic Advisories. \"I think the general feeling is that (Spirit) had it under control with what appeared to be a reasonable agreement,\" he said. But after more than a decade of cost pressure on the aerospace industry, \"labor feels like they have some power.\" Spirit will suspend factory production prior to the expiration of its contract with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) on June 24, but will continue to pay employees, it said. \"Despite this setback, we are not distracted from the task at hand. We look forward to continued meetings with IAM leadership,\" Spirit said. Although IAM and Spirit reached a tentative contract agreement last week, 79% of workers voted to reject the contract and 85% voted to strike, the union said on Thursday. IAM added it would regroup and begin planning \"the following steps to bring the company back to the table.\" About 55% of Spirit's U.S. workers were covered by the agreement, which will expire this month. Spirit had 12,735 workers in its six U.S. facilities, of which 11,000 were located in Wichita. Boeing said it continued to monitor the situation and support Spirit. Stan Deal, the head of Boeing Commercial Airplanes business, encouraged employees to \"stay focused on our task at hand, which is to continue to build and deliver the finest airplanes in the world,\" in an internal email seen by Reuters. The planemaker has been working to boost output of its 737 MAX jets to 38 per month from the current level of 31, and 787 jets to five per month from the present level of four this year. \"(The upcoming strike) threatens Boeing’s pace of production on these programs,\" J.P.Morgan analyst Seth Seifman said in a note. Boeing has more than 100 MAX planes in its inventory, so it could shift workers from production to modifying inventory jets to keep deliveries flowing in the event of a stop at its production facility in Renton, Washington. Airbus, while not commenting on the work stoppage itself, said it conducted regular assessments with suppliers to mitigate potential risks to production. The strike is yet another setback for Spirit, which has been grappling with a recent quality issue on 737 fuselages and is experiencing cash flow pressures. In May, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said it would be difficult to make contingency plans for a strike at Spirit. \"Even if they tried to get ahead of it by virtue of their current production, that will be measured in weeks not in months, so we're supporting them in every way possible to get to a constructive answer,\" he said.",

More than 50 companies, including defence, pharmaceutical and tech firms, will participate in the mission organised by the US-ASEAN Business Council, an industry body, according to a list seen by Reuters. The delegation is a sign of rising interest in the global manufacturing hub, which is benefiting from a shift away from China amid Sino-U.S. trade friction. Vietnam, with a population of 100 million people, also has a rapidly-growing consumer market as its middle class expands. \"This is the biggest-ever mission in Vietnam,\" said Vu Tu Thanh, the US-ASEAN Business Council's representative in the country, noting that the body had been organising these events for three decades. Streaming giant Netflix (NFLX.O)New Tab , which Reuters last month reported was planning to open an office in Vietnam, is among the companies joining the trip. Netflix did not respond to a request for comment. Aerospace manufacturers Boeing (BA.N)New Tab , Lockheed Martin (LMT.N)New Tab and Bell (TXT.N)New Tab will hold meetings with state-owned Vietnamese defence procurement companies, Thanh told Reuters, adding that it was the first time in about a decade that security firms had decided to join the annual mission to Vietnam. In December, the same companies held talks with Vietnamese government officials about the possible sale of helicopters and drones, as the country seeks new suppliers and the Ukraine conflict strains the capabilities of Russia, for decades Vietnam's main military partner. \"Helicopters is one of the things the companies hope to sell to the Vietnamese,\" Thanh said, although he cautioned that defence deals took time to be completed and no immediate breakthrough was expected. Boeing said in a statement that its discussions with officials would focus on its growing partnership with Vietnam and ways to strengthen the country's aviation and defence capabilities. Lockheed Martin and Bell did not respond to requests for comment. The majority of the companies joining the business mission already have a business or manufacturing presence in Vietnam, including Apple (AAPL.O)New Tab , Coca-Cola (KO.N)New Tab and PepsiCo (PEP.O)New Tab , Thanh said, with some planning to expand it. Some companies are also coming to get a better sense of the political situation after recent turmoil in the Communist-Party led country, including the resignation of the president in January, Thanh added. Participants will have meetings with Vietnam's top political and regulatory leadership, including with Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. Thanh said some companies were interested in Vietnam as a manufacturing hub and in providing services to increasingly wealthy consumers at a time when economic growth reached more than 8% last year. Among them is SpaceX, which is looking to sell its satellite internet services to Vietnam and other countries in the region, Thanh said. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. The mission will also include semiconductors companies, pharmaceutical giants Pfizer (PFE.N)New Tab and Johnson & Johnson (PFE.N)New Tab , medical device maker Abbott (ABT.N)New Tab , financial firms Visa (V.N)New Tab and Citibank (C.N)New Tab , internet and cloud companies Meta (META.O)New Tab and Amazon Web Services (AMZN.O)New Tab , the list showed.",

            "text": "Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and Qatar Airways fought in court in front of Boeing on Friday as a dispute over damage to A350 jets descended into a tug-of-war over confidential documents while the sums at stake in their unprecedented falling out topped $1.5 billion. Boeing was dragged into the case for the first time as lawyers quarrelled over access to a preliminary contract for its 737 MAX jets - illustrating the domino effect on a $150 billion global jetliner industry from the rare London legal battle. Qatar Airways is suing Airbus in a division of the High Court over damage to the painted surface and anti-lightning system on A350 jets, saying safety could be at risk. Backed by European regulators, Airbus acknowledges quality flaws but insists the jets are safe. The two sides must provide each other with thousands of pages of documents as their dispute - which has already altered the shape of planemaking competition - heads towards a rare London aerospace trial in mid-2023, barring a settlement. The case has shone a spotlight on the inner workings of the jet market, including contractual details and the industrial playbook for preparing delivery of new jets. The number of A350s grounded by Qatar because of surface damage rose this week to 28 out of 53 A350s in its fleet. Airbus said last month it had revoked all remaining A350 orders from Qatar Airways. Both sides raised the stakes again on Friday as they accused each other of foot-dragging over releasing documents. They are also urging the return of tens of millions of dollars of deposits to the airline and credit payments to the manufacturer. In a counter-claim in February, Airbus asked Qatar Airways for $220 million in damages and detailed another $185 million of credits against future deliveries which it said had been paid in advance into three funds for the development of Qatar's aviation sector as part of the original A350 deal in 2007-2009. Airbus said in a summary of arguments ahead of Friday's hearing that it was seeking reimbursement and had sought details from the airline on how the money had been spent. Qatar Airways did not immediately respond to a request for comment. People familiar with the case said Qatar Airways was strongly arguing that the money had been invested as anticipated and dismissed discussion of the funds as a legal manoeuvre. For its part, Qatar Airways accused Airbus of trying to bring European regulators \"on side\" by controlling what they saw. It reproduced an internal Airbus email titled \"Easy mtg\" from the top A350 engineer asking colleagues to show the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) the worst damage, adding: \"We need to damp the first impression they will have\". An Airbus spokesperson said this demonstrated a \"warts and all\" approach. EASA did not respond to a request for comment. There was also a spat in court over access to emails of Qatar Airways' high-profile chief executive Akbar Al Baker. The airline was ordered to start a search for relevant documents, subject to Qatari law, but was given six weeks to address security concerns over information held on government servers. With the case attracting a growing army of lawyers, Boeing (BA.N)New Tab also marched into court 19 on Friday, putting both plane giants on stage with one of their largest buyers for possibly the first time outside air shows where jet deals get announced. Boeing insisted it did not plan to get involved in the escalating dispute between its rival and its client. But its appearance came months after the A350 dispute widened when Airbus revoked a separate deal with Qatar for 50 A321neo jets, arguing they were linked by a crossover clause. Qatar subsequently ordered the Boeing 737 MAX and this catapulted arguments over the relative merits of the jets into court, with Airbus unusually saying the MAX was as good as the A321 in a bid to avoid being forced to build the jets for Qatar. The airline has accordingly been ordered to hand over a preliminary version of the MAX contract to Airbus, but Boeing objected on Friday to Airbus internal lawyers seeing the data. \"The disclosure of pricing information...that is dynamite,\" Boeing's lawyer Paul Stanley told the court.",

The sanctions on Boeing Defense, Space, and Security CEO Ted Colbert and Raytheon Technologies Corp (RTX.N)New Tab boss Gregory Hayes are in response to the U.S. State Department approval on Sept. 2 of the sale of military equipment to Taiwan. Those sales include 60 anti-ship missiles and 100 air-to-air missiles, of which the respective principal contractors are Boeing Defense, a division of Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab , and Raytheon.

Despite the approval, Chinese airlines have not resumed flying the MAX and have not accepted deliveries of new MAX aircraft. The U.S. government has previously accused the Chinese government of blocking tens of billions of dollars of MAX deliveries to China. read more Before the MAX was grounded, Boeing was selling a quarter of the planes it built annually to Chinese buyers, its largest customers. Raytheon sells to China through its United Technologies engine business. Friday's announcement marks the first time Beijing identified and imposed sanctions against individuals from these companies. Beijing considers the self-ruled island of Taiwan a wayward province it has vowed to bring under control, by force if necessary.

            "text": "French engine maker Safran (SAF.PA)New Tab expressed renewed concerns on Friday over Airbus proposals to almost double jet production, as a battered aerospace industry remains split on how to share an emerging recovery supporting shares in both companies. The world's third largest aerospace contractor, which co-produces engines for Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab with General Electric (GE.N)New Tab , stuck to a cautious view despite assurances from AirbusNew Tab on Thursday about the pace of demand once the pandemic is over. The European planemaker plans to lift output to 65 A320-family jets a month by 2023 from recent rates of 40 a month and is exploring rates as high as 75 a month, triggering fears of overproduction from engine makers and leasing firms. read more Safran Chief Executive Olivier Andries, speaking as the company reported quarterly results, said he saw little difficulty in producing enough engines to meet Airbus' firm target of 65 a month, not far above pre-crisis rates of 60. But he signalled little progress had been made in agreeing on increases beyond that, with both Airbus and key suppliers standing their ground in quarterly earnings calls this week. \"On the exploration of rates above 65, it is obviously a challenge, and for us the question remains the same - whether such rates can be sustained over the medium term. It is still an open question,\" Andries told reporters. \"Sure, we have already seen production increases in the past, before the crisis. But the supply chain has been greatly weakened during the crisis.\" German engine maker MTU Aero Engines, which supplies parts for the GE-Safran consortium's main rival, Pratt & Whitney (RTX.N)New Tab , was more supportive of Airbus' plans. Andries noted suppliers were experiencing global labour shortages, a recurring theme in the latest earnings worldwide. Despite this, Safran raised its full-year cashflow target and reaffirmed other goals as it reported a 10.4% increase in quarterly revenues. Its shares rose more than 3%. Third-quarter revenue of 3.734 billion euros ($4.4 billion) was also up 5.7% compared to the second quarter of this year, after strong summer traffic in Europe and the United States. The partial recovery from the pandemic boosted sales of spare parts for older engines as well as parts for other equipment like brakes and cabins. Engine makers and lessors make most of their money over the life of an aircraft, while planemakers get paid for new jets. Safran's widely watched civil aftermarket revenue rose 43.8% in dollar terms in the third quarter, compared to the year-ago period, and by 24% compared to the second quarter this year.",

            "text": "Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab have set the stage for the next chapter in their titanic rivalry by remodelling two of the world's largest buildings - gutted by changes in air travel. As the last Boeing 747 leaves its factory later on Tuesday, part of the company's historic wide-body plant has been earmarked for production of in-demand smaller jets, matching a change of focus at the home of the defunct Airbus A380. The moves ease doubts over the future of Boeing's under-used Everett plant north of Seattle, the world's largest building by volume, and the empty Jean-Luc Lagardere A380 assembly hall in Toulouse, the world's second largest by usable space. Everett's industrial activity has also been sharply reduced by a decision to move 787 output to a single base in South Carolina due to a decline in demand for large planes. The smaller 737 will slot into a bay currently used for some remaining 787 work. Boeing said on Monday it would add a new 737 MAX production line in Everett in mid-2024, complementing three already in place at the Renton plant, 36 miles to the south. That comes as Airbus is mid-way through installing a new production line for its hot-selling A321neo narrow-body jet in the deserted Lagardere building. It has also announced plans to expand a plant in Alabama. Once exclusively serving as fortresses in an economic war over big twin-aisle jets, the colossal plants will become an industrial beehive for profitable single-aisle models, reflecting a surge of demand for short and medium trips. Analysts said Boeing's move signalled confidence in demand including from China, despite recent trade tensions. But they noted both sites will still have spare capacity as future production strategy and automation move centre-stage in the jet market duopoly, ahead of new orders or jet designs. \"At this stage in the industry evolution, with no new programme starts in the near future, production strategy is coming to the fore,\" said aerospace consultant Jerrold Lundquist, managing director of The Lundquist Group. Airbus and Boeing were for years evenly matched in the single-aisle market which generates most cash. But Airbus pulled sharply ahead due to strong sales of the A321neo and a safety crisis over the 737 MAX, from which Boeing is just recovering. Boeing aims initially to boost monthly single-aisle output to 50 from 30, and Airbus wants to go as high as 75 from about 45, though analysts question how quickly this can be done. But narrowing the gap is crucial to preserving Boeing's main cash cow and strengthening the platform for future launches. \"(Boeing) don't want to be in a situation where Airbus moves to 70 and they are stuck at 50. They want to have the possibility of matching what Airbus does,\" said economist Adam Pilarski, senior vice-president at consultancy AVITAS. \"So this is a very important statement (to Airbus): 'We are not going to withdraw from the market',\" he added. Boeing declined to elaborate on Monday's announcement. Airbus declined to comment. Boeing's move is also seen as a bid to reinforce its appeal to investors, some of whom have voiced fears that it is drifting after Chief Executive Dave Calhoun ruled out launching a new plane within the next decade - even though many analysts agree it makes financial and technological sense to wait. \"This is Calhoun's way of signalling: don't count us out, we're in this for the long haul,\" Lundquist said. Boeing has not said how the line would be designed but both companies are expected to seize on the chance to test the latest automation in part of the market where unit costs are critical.",

All three companies are expected to report losses in their third-quarter results as they struggle to resolve manufacturing defects on their most profitable aircraft and engine products. RTX engine subsidiary Pratt & Whitney disclosed in September it will take a $3 billion charge in the quarter after planning to replace components containing contaminated metal powder on as many as 700 Geared Turbofan (GTF) engines. Meanwhile, Boeing and Spirit, a supplier for the U.S. planemaker and European rival Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab , are contending with a lapse involving misdrilled holes on Boeing’s 737 MAX. Boeing expanded inspections this month. Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard called the companies the sector's \"problem children.\" RTX is expected to report a loss of 74 cents per diluted share versus a profit of 94 cents a year ago, according to analysts polled by LSEG. Boeing is expected to report a loss of $2.23 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $5.49 a year ago. Spirit is projected to report a loss of $1.03 a share, compared to a loss of $1.22 a year earlier, according to LSEG data. RTX, the first to release results on Tuesday, will face continued scrutiny about the GTF engine issue. Analysts are concerned shop visits could drag on longer than expected or that a higher volume of engines - or additional engine types - could be affected, triggering higher compensation to customers. “Some of these customer concessions might come in the form of free services, which are likely staggered and may drag out the cash recognition,” Bank of America analyst Ron Epstein said. Boeing investors will fixate on 2023 free cash-flow generation, which the planemaker projected would finish between $3 billion and $5 billion. It reports results on Wednesday. The target may no longer be achievable if Boeing can no longer meet its goal of delivering 400 737s this year. “It was already looking like it was going to be a struggle to hit that 2023 guidance. It's more of a struggle now, even at the low end,” Vertical's Stallard said. Spirit, which reports Nov. 1, has already revealed preliminary results as part of a new price agreement with Boeing. But the earnings call will be a test for newly-named interim CEO Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive and Spirit board member known for fixing tough operational problems. \"The appointment of Pat shows one thing: the criticality of the situation at Spirit right now,\" said Michel Merluzeau, director of aerospace analysis at AIR consultancy group. Investors will be looking for details on how Shanahan plans to restore the embattled supplier's balance sheet and get aircraft production back on track, he said. (This story has been corrected after LSEG revised the estimate to a loss of 74 cents from a 24 cent loss in paragraph 6)",

            "text": "The International Space Station (ISS) was thrown briefly out of control on Thursday when jet thrusters of a newly arrived Russian research module inadvertently fired a few hours after it was docked to the orbiting outpost, NASA officials said. The seven crew members aboard - two Russian cosmonauts, three NASA astronauts, a Japanese astronaut and a European space agency astronaut from France - were never in any immediate danger, according to NASA and Russian state-owned news agency RIA. But the malfunction prompted NASA to postpone until at least Aug. 3 its planned launchNew Tab of Boeing's (BA.N)New Tab new CST-100 Starliner capsule on a highly anticipated uncrewed test flight to the space station. The Starliner had been set to blast off atop an Atlas V rocket on Friday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Thursday's mishap began about three hours after the multipurpose Nauka module had latched onto the space station, as mission controllers in Moscow were performing some post-docking \"reconfiguration\" procedures, according to NASA. The module's jets inexplicably restarted, causing the entire station to pitch out of its normal flight position some 250 miles above the Earth, leading the mission's flight director to declare a \"spacecraft emergency,\" U.S. space agency officials said. Slideshow: Images from space An unexpected drift in the station's orientation was first detected by automated ground sensors, followed 15 minutes later by a \"loss of attitude control\" that lasted a little over 45 minutes, according to Joel Montalbano, manager of NASA's space station program. 'TUG-OF-WAR' Flight teams on the ground managed to restore the space station's orientation by activating thrusters on another module of the orbiting platform, NASA officials said. In its broadcast coverage of the incident, RIA cited NASA specialists at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, as describing the struggle to regain control of the space station as a \"tug of war\" between the two modules. At the height of the incident, the station was pitching out of alignment at the rate of about a half a degree per second, Montalbano said during a NASA conference call with reporters. The Nauka engines were ultimately switched off, the space station was stabilized and its orientation was restored to where it had begun, NASA said. Communication with the crew was lost for several minutes twice during the disruption, but \"there was no immediate danger at any time to the crew,\" Montalbano said. He said \"the crew really didn't feel any movement.\" Had the situation become so dangerous as to require evacuation of personnel, the crew could have escaped in a SpaceX crew capsule still parked at the outpost and designed to serve as a \"lifeboat\" if necessary, said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program. What caused the malfunction of the thrusters on the Nauka module, delivered by the Russian space agency Roscosmos, has yet to be determined, NASA officials said. Montalbano said there was no immediate sign of any damage to the space station. The flight correction maneuvers used up more propellant reserves than desired, \"but nothing I would worry about,\" he said. After its launch last week from Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome, the module experienced a series of glitches that raised concern about whether the docking procedure would go smoothly. Roscosmos attributed Thursday's post-docking issue to Nauka's engines having to work with residual fuel in the craft, TASS news agency reported. \"The process of transferring the Nauka module from flight mode to 'docked with ISS' mode is underway. Work is being carried out on the remaining fuel in the module,\" Roscosmos was cited by TASS as saying. The Nauka module is designed to serve as a research lab, storage unit and airlock that will upgrade Russia's capabilities aboard the ISS. A live broadcast showed the module, named after the Russian word for \"science,\" docking with the space station a few minutes later than scheduled. \"According to telemetry data and reports from the ISS crew, the onboard systems of the station and the Nauka module are operating normally,\" Roscosmos said in a statement. \"There is contact!!!\" Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos, wrote on Twitter moments after the docking.",

            "text": "A China Eastern Airlines (600115.SS)New Tab Boeing 737-800 with 132 people on board crashed in mountains in southern China on Monday after a sudden plunge from cruising altitude at about the time when it would normally start to descend ahead of its landing. Media said there were no signs of survivors on the domestic flight. The airline said it deeply mourned the passengers and crew, without specifying how many people had been killed on the jet, an earlier model to the 737 MAX with a strong safety record. Boeing (BA.N)New Tab said it was ready to assist China Eastern and was in contact with U.S. transportation safety regulators over the incident. Chinese media carried brief highway video footage from a vehicle's dashcam apparently showing a jet diving to the ground behind trees at an angle of about 35 degrees off vertical. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage. Flight MU5735 was en route from the southwestern city of Kunming, capital of Yunnan province, to Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong, bordering Hong Kong, when it crashed. China Eastern said the cause of the crash was under investigation. Such accidents typically involve multiple factors and experts warned it was far too early to draw any conclusions on the potential causes, especially in light of the scarce information available. Investigators will be scouring the wreckage and flight recorders for factors that could have caused the plane to plummet vertically and slam into the mountains at high speed. The airline said it had sent a working group to the site. There were no foreigners on the flight, Chinese state television reported, citing China Eastern. Relatives, friends and colleagues of passengers gathered late on Monday in a cordoned off area at the jet's destination, Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. One man surnamed Yan said that a colleague had been on the plane, and that he had notified the 29-year-old's mother. \"When she picked up the phone, she choked up,\" said Yan, adding that he had a \"heavy heart\" when he heard the news. China Eastern staff were making arrangements for relatives who wished to travel to the crash site on Tuesday, Yan said. Reuters was not able to independently verify Yan's identity. The aircraft, with 123 passengers and nine crew on board, lost contact over the city of Wuzhou, China's Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and the airline said. The flight left Kunming at 1:11 p.m. (0511 GMT), FlightRadar24 data showed, and had been due to land in Guangzhou at 3:05 p.m. (0705 GMT). The plane, which the flight tracking service said was six years old, had been cruising at 29,100 feet at 0620 GMT. The same flight number a day earlier began a normal gradual descent from the same altitude, also at 0620 GMT, and landed safely in Guangzhou, according to Flightradar24. The flight that crashed instead began a rapid descent to 7,425 feet before recovering briefly to 8,600 feet and then descended rapidly again, FlightRadar24 data showed. The last tracked altitude was 3,225 feet above sea level. Media cited a rescue official as saying the plane had disintegrated and caused a fire destroying bamboo trees. The People's Daily quoted a provincial firefighting department official as saying there was no sign of life among the debris. State media showed a piece of the plane on a scarred, earthen hillside. There was no sign of a fire or personal belongings. Crashes during the cruise phase of flights are relatively rare, even though this period accounts for the majority of flight time. Crashes during the descent stage when the plane first leaves cruising altitude are even more uncommon. Boeing said last year 13% of fatal commercial accidents globally between 2011 and 2020 occurred during the cruise phase, whereas 3% occurred on descent, none on initial approach, 28% on final approach and 26% on landing. Online weather data showed partly cloudy conditions with good visibility in Wuzhou at the time of the crash. President Xi Jinping called for investigators to determine the cause of the crash as soon as possible, state broadcaster CCTV reported. Boeing said in a statement that its thoughts were with the passengers and crew. \"Boeing is in contact with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and our technical experts are prepared to assist with the investigation led by (CAAC),\" the company said. The disaster comes as Boeing seeks to rebound from several overlapping crises including the coronavirus pandemic and crashes involving its 737 MAX model. Shares of the planemaker closed 3.6% lower. China Eastern has grounded its fleet of 737-800 planes, state media reported. It has 109 of the aircraft, according to FlightRadar24. Shares of China Eastern Airlines in Hong Kong closed down 6.5% after news of the crash emerged, while its U.S.-listed shares closed 6.3% lower. Aviation data provider OAG said this month that state-owned China Eastern Airlines was the world's sixth-largest carrier by scheduled weekly seat capacity. read more The 737-800 has a good safety record and is the predecessor to the 737 MAX model that has been grounded in China for more than three years after fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. The crash has again thrust the U.S. manufacturer's most sold aircraft family into the spotlight and comes as it works to emerge from the 737 MAX safety crisis and global pandemic, which decimated air travel demand and strained its finances. Investigators will search for the plane's black boxes - the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder - to shed light on the crash. The U.S. NTSB said it had appointed a senior air safety investigator as an accredited U.S. representative to China's probe. read more Air crash investigations are typically led by the country of the accident and include participation by the plane's country of origin, so U.S. investigators would be expected to join the probe of the U.S.-made Boeing jet. China's airline safety record has been among the best in the world for a decade, although it is less transparent than in countries like the U.S. and Australia where regulators release detailed reports on non-fatal incidents, according to Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at industry publication Flightglobal. read more",

            "text": "Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab said on Sunday it will have to do more work on about 50 undelivered 737 MAX airplanes, potentially delaying some near-term deliveries, after its supplier Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N)New Tab discovered two mis-drilled holes on some fuselages. Boeing confirmed the findings in response to a Reuters query after industry sources said an \"edge margin\", or spacing problem, had been found in holes drilled on a window frame on some jets. Boeing, which has been under fire from regulators and airlines since the Jan. 5 blowout of a door plug on a 737 MAX 9, said safety was unaffected and existing 737s could keep flying. \"This past Thursday, a supplier notified us of a non-conformance in some 737 fuselages. I want to thank an employee at the supplier who flagged to his manager that two holes may not have been drilled exactly to our requirements,\" Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal said in a letter to staff referring to Spirit, which is the sole 737 fuselage supplier. \"While this potential condition is not an immediate flight safety issue and all 737s can continue operating safely, we currently believe we will have to perform rework on about 50 undelivered airplanes,\" Deal said in the letter, first reported exclusively by Reuters. Spirit spokesperson Joe Buccino told Reuters that as part of its 360-degree quality management program, a member of its team identified an issue that did not conform to engineering standards. \"We are in close communication with Boeing on this matter,\" he said. Deal said Boeing plans to devote several \"factory days\" this week at the Renton 737 plant outside Seattle to work on the mis-aligned holes and finish off other outstanding work. Such days allow teams to pause normal work and attend to specific tasks without shutting production. The amount of rework time is expected to be finalised in coming days. It is the latest effort by Boeing to tighten its operations after the blowout on an Alaska Airlines (ALK.N)New Tab jet threw the spotlight on quality controls. Investigators, who have been examining whether the bolts on the Alaska Airlines door plug were missing or badly fitted, are expected to issue an interim report this week. At the same time, Boeing has asked a major supplier, which it did not identify, to halt shipments until jobs have been completed to specification, Deal said. \"While this delay in shipment will affect our production schedule, it will improve overall quality and stability.\" Boeing said parts that already conform to the right specification can continue to be shipped. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had no immediate comment. The U.S. regulator has ordered Boeing to cap 737 production at the current rate of 38 jets a month for an undefined period while it addresses quality lapses, deferring the increases in production needed to meet rising demand for new jets. So far, Boeing has said it will keep buying parts from suppliers at previously planned higher rates in order to cushion the impact they face from the freeze in production growth. The 737 MAX checks focus on potentially sloppy positioning of two holes on a window frame assembly supplied by Spirit, a condition known as \"short edge margin,\" the industry sources said. Edge margins, or the gap between a fastener and the edge of a metal sheet, have to meet strict specifications designed to minimise the risk of metal fatigue over the long term. In the past, the FAA has occasionally ordered inspections for cracks resulting from fastener holes being mis-drilled. As of Friday, the \"non-conformance\" or quality defect had been found in 22 fuselages out of 47 inspected up to that point, spread between Boeing and Spirit, and may exist in some 737s in service, the sources said. The findings came to light in a routine notification known as a Notice of Escapement, in which suppliers notify Boeing of any known or suspected quality slip, the sources said. Such quality reports are common in aerospace but the discovery comes as Boeing and its best-selling jet are under the microscope following the Alaska Airlines emergency. The U.S. planemaker last month urged suppliers to intensify checks and told them it is \"imperative\" that they meet quality requirements, according to a memo seen by Reuters. People familiar with the matter said Boeing and Spirit have yet to come with an agreed position on how many of the mis-drilled holes have to be addressed, and how many of the errors are so slight that the fuselages can be used \"as is\". Spirit, spun off from Boeing in 2005, is due to unveil earnings on Tuesday. Boeing 737s are assembled in Renton outside Seattle from fuselages shipped by train from Sprit in Wichita, Kansas.",

            "title": "Jetmakers’ inflation shield no match for soaring costs",
            "text": "Inflation clauses that determine how much airlines pay for new jets have jumped into a \"hyper-escalation\" band, pushing up aircraft prices but still leaving manufacturers unable to fully pass on their soaring costs, industry executives told Reuters. The hike to the top inflationary band is a rare move in the industry, potentially triggering a rise in airfares by airlines while manufacturers will also be left out of pocket, experts warned during major gatherings over the past week in Dublin, the centre of the global aviation finance industry. Airlines buy jets at a basic price agreed in confidential negotiations but the final price includes adjustments for inflation during long production waiting times, based on U.S. factory input and labour costs, wherever the planes are built. For years, these \"escalation\" clauses discreetly swelled the profits of planemakers as price revisions exceeded their long-term purchasing costs, people familiar with the contracts say. Now, with key U.S. cost indices rising by the largest amount in over a decade, the price adjustments are steeper and the cushion between escalation and real costs has vanished. \"It's always been a windfall game for the (manufacturers) so long as they're efficient enough to make sure their own costs don't grow as fast as the escalation,\" AerCap (AER.N)New Tab Chief Executive Aengus Kelly told the Airline Economics conference. The rapid spike means some manufacturers may be left out of pocket as the clauses were negotiated during an era when inflation fears were low. Yet leasing companies who secured limits to their exposure during that decades-long lull in inflation will be in a more comfortable position than some competitors, Kelly said. \"It's certainly something that we're watching carefully... We're seeing very strong inflation pressures in the United States,\" said Steven C. Udvar-Hazy, senior vice-president at Tokyo Century (8439.T)New Tab leasing unit Aviation Capital Group. \"The inflationary environment in the United States is of concern to us because that can have knock-on effects on escalation in the broader supply chain,\" he told the Airfinance Journal conference. Inflation is a double-edged sword for aircraft leasing companies that own half the world's fleet. They benefit from the impact of inflation on the value of aircraft they own. But they must also contend with rising purchase prices, prompting some to insist on escalation caps. Exact terms depend on the buyer. But in one common type of structure, the lowest escalation band is paid entirely by the airline or leasing buyer and tends to be capped at rates averaging around 3%, sources familiar with the process said. After that, there may be a second band up to around 5% where manufacturers carry all the additional risk. When inflation kicks into the highest tier of all, triggering so-called \"hyper-escalation\" clauses, the two sides typically agree to split the extra burden, they said. \"That is where we are now, in the hyperinflation band, and this is causing a lot of pain for everyone,\" a senior industry source told Reuters. In rare cases, preferred clients may have a get-out clause allowing both sides to walk away from the deal entirely if inflation shoots beyond an extreme level, one source said. Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab , Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and Embraer (EMBR3.SA)New Tab declined comment on contractual matters. All are said to face tough negotiations over price clauses on future airplane deals. \"We don't see the current high levels of inflation very often but the impact of what is happening is huge. Escalation is going to be a big topic going forward,\" Embraer Commercial Aviation Chief Executive Arjan Meijer told Reuters.",

Tepid August payrolls data on Friday last week raised concerns that the economic recovery was slowing down.

Easy central bank policies and reopening optimism have pushed the benchmark indexes to record highs over the past few weeks, but concerns over rising Delta coronavirus infections and its impact on the economic recovery could impede the rally.

            "text": "French aerospace supplier Safran SAF.PA posted a 7.1% increase in underlying profit in 2021, despite a drop in sales worsened by a freeze in deliveries of Boeing's 787 and a sluggish recovery in demand for other long-haul jets. The maker of engines for passenger and fighter jets, as well as a raft of equipment from escape slides to lie-flat business seats, said its recurring operating income rose to 1.805 billion euros ($2 billion) from 1.686 billion as margins grew to 11.8% from 10.2%. Revenues fell 7.5% to 15.257 billion euros led by lower demand for equipment such as the landing gear that Safran makes for Boeing's 787 - which is mired in production and regulatory problems - and the cabins it designs for long-distance jets. Analysts had on average expected operating profit of 1.75 billion euros on sales of 15.4 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Long-haul travel remains weak in the aftermath of COVID-19 travel restrictions, while Safran said it expected demand for smaller narrowbody jets to reach pre-crisis levels by end-2022. Chief Executive Olivier Andries said Safran, which co-produces engines for all Boeing and some Airbus narrowbody jets through its CFM joint venture with General Electric GE.N, was ready to raise production rates in 2022, without elaborating. Safran has agreed to support a roughly 50% increase in Airbus narrowbody production to 65 a month by summer 2023, but has clashed with Airbus about whether to keep increasing output beyond then due to worries about the impact on repair revenues. In a results statement, Andries also said Safran would continue to reinvest capital from asset sales into \"complementary, bolt-on acquisitions with growth potential”. The engine maker's widely watched civil aftermarket grew 7.1% in dollar terms in 2021 and Safran said it expected the figure for repairs and servicing to rise by 25-30% this year. It predicted total 2022 revenue of 18-18.2 billion euros and a recurring operating margin of 13%. ($1 = 0.8902 euros)",

Tufan Erginbilgic, who took the helm of Rolls-Royce in January, has called the company a \"burning platform\" and launched a transformation programme to improve the profitability of the maker of engines for Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 planes. Shares in Rolls-Royce have surged 60% since the start of the year, lifted by optimism about a recovery in air travel and Erginbilgic's turnaround plans. The company on Friday named McCabe, a BP executive, as its new chief financial officer, to join later this year. She will replace Panos Kakoullis who has been in the job for less than two years. Rob Watson takes on the role of president of civil aerospace with immediate effect, moving from Rolls-Royce's electric aviation unit, while Adam Riddle becomes president of the defence business. New finance chief McCabe is currently senior vice president, finance for the customer and products division of BP. Commenting on the hire, Erginbilgic said: \"Her track record of promoting rigorous financial discipline and experience of delivering performance management to achieve dramatic improvements will be invaluable as we move, at pace, to transform Rolls-Royce.\" The previous civil aerospace boss Chris Cholerton was named group president, taking on responsibility for Rolls-Royce's nuclear operations, including temporarily as interim CEO of its small modular reactors (SMR) unit. Rolls-Royce said the previous SMR boss, Tom Samson, would leave with immediate effect. The group wants SMRs, smaller nuclear power stations, to be a major part of its future and is competing to be selected by the British government as the chosen design to help generate electricity for the country's grid.",

            "text": "Thai Airways (THAI.BK)New Tab aims to finalise a deal to buy at least 30 new aircraft by the end of the year and could double its fleet of narrow-body jets over the next decade, its chief executive said on Friday. The airline will issue a 'request for proposal' to Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab to buy 30 wide-body and an undisclosed number of narrow-body aircraft next week, Chai Eamsiri said in an interview with Reuters at the airline's headquarters in Bangkok. The Southeast Asian carrier is looking to cash in on a post-pandemic travel boom by bolstering regional routes, but there have been concerns whether planemakers Airbus and Boeing will be able to ramp up output to meet delivery targets. Thai Airways, which began bankruptcy protected restructuring of debt worth 400 billion baht ($11.17 billion) in 2021, currently has a fleet of 20 Airbus A320 aircraft and has secured a dozen new A321neo on lease for delivery in 2025 and 2026, Chai said. \"The long-term narrow-body composition of our fleet should be 30-40 aircraft,\" he said. These aircraft would be deployed to serve destinations in Southeast Asia, India, southern China and southern Japan - key medium-haul routes that Thai Airways wants to reinforce. \"We have to concentrate and focus more on the regional routes, which is our, I can say, weak point,\" Chai said. The carrier's wide-body fleet will also increase from 45 currently to 56 aircraft by the first quarter of next year, with the additional jets coming on dry lease contracts, which typically do not include crew, he said. \"That's for the short term,\" Chai said, adding that the aircraft will be used on long-distance intercontinental routes to Australia and Europe that have seen a strong recovery since the pandemic. Thai Airways' cabin factor - the percentage of seats sold - was at about 84% in the last quarter and advance bookings from markets like Europe were looking \"promising\", he said. Chai, a former Thai Airways chief financial officer who took over as CEO last November, said the airline's pandemic-driven restructuring plan was on track and it would relist on the stock market by the first quarter of 2025. \"If we can do it earlier, we will do it,\" he said. \"But it depends on the performance this year also.\"",

With most market participants expecting a 25 basis-point hike from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) later on Wednesday, the focus will be on the subsequent news conference. Investors will be listening carefully to Chair Jerome Powell for indications of whether or not another interest rate hike is in the pipeline. The Fed's communication could set the tone for markets ahead of policy decisions from the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Friday. The ECB appears poised to make another small hike while the BOJ is widely expected to leave its ultra-easy policy settings on hold.

In Asia, markets are awaiting details on fresh economic stimulus measures from China following the Politburo's pledge on Monday to step up policy support for the faltering economy.

Argentine daily La Nacion and other media said Judge Federico Villena had given the order for the three Iranians and two Venezuelans on the crew of the Boeing 747 cargo plane of Iranian origin that belongs to Venezuelan company Emtrasur. The court could not immediately be reached for comment.

The state-owned carrier, also known as Saudia, is planning to expand rapidly over the next eight years as part of a government strategy to transform the kingdom into a transport hub. \"It's a good size fleet order that will have to be placed,\" Chief Executive Ibrahim Koshy told Reuters at the Dubai Airshow, without disclosing how many aircraft it would order. \"It's something that will take place. Definitely in 2022.\" The order would help fuel network expansion to 135 mostly international destinations by 2030, up from 90 in 2019 which included 28 destinations in Saudi Arabia, he said. It would later post orders to replace older aircraft and expand its narrow body fleet, while some aircraft types will be removed to simplify the fleet, Koshy said. Saudia is expanding ahead of a planned launch of a new state-owned airline to based in the capital, Riyadh. \"The growth that is taking place in the country actually justifies a second carrier coming in as a full service airline.\" Koshy said Saudia would focus on developing a hub in Jeddah once the new airline starts operations, and would see it operate to 200 combined destinations with its low-cost unit by 2030. Saudia has forecast significant expansion in Asia Pacific and the Americas, carrying a combined 85 million passengers a year with its unit by 2030, up from 35 million in 2019, he said. Saudia, one of the Middle East’s oldest airlines, could return to profitability by 2024, at which time it expects to return to pre-pandemic passenger traffic, Koshy said.",

After 17 years of construction and tests, Modi commissioned the INS Vikrant - the navy's second operational aircraft carrier and the largest warship ever built in India - at a state-run shipyard in the south. \"Today, India has joined those countries in the world which can manufacture such a huge aircraft carrier with indigenous technology,\" Modi said. \"It is a symbol of indigenous potential, indigenous resources and indigenous skills.\" Designed to accommodate a crew of about 1,600 and a fleet of 30 aircraft, the Vikrant will rely on Russian-designed MIG-29K aircraft that already operate from India's other carrier, the INS Vikramaditya, which India bought from Russia. Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and France's Dassault (AM.PA)New Tab are seeking to provide India with more than two dozen jets for the Vikrant. India is one of the world's largest arms importers, spending $12.4 billion between 2018 and 2021, but it has been seeking to develop its own manufacturing capabilities as key supplier Russia fights a war in Ukraine and faces sanctions. read more India has identified some 8,000 imported defence items worth about 82 trillion rupees ($1.03 trillion) in 2022-23 that it wants its firms to make, according to the defence ministry.

China, which also has two operational carriers and is working on a third, has a much larger fleet of 335 vessels, including about 48 destroyers, 43 frigates and 61 corvettes. \"Security concerns in the Indo-Pacific region and the Indian Ocean have long been ignored,\" Modi said. \"But today this area is a major defence priority for our country.\"",

            "text": "Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab is set to deliver more than 600 jets this year after a strong first half driven in part by deals that allow some carriers to delay accounting for new planes on their balance sheets, industry sources said. The financial structures are part of a raft of innovations and compromise deals thrashed out by the European planemaker as it tries to keep cash rolling in during the pandemic. Most analysts expect the recent delivery trend to contribute to solid first-half results on Thursday. Airbus has predicted full-year deliveries at least equivalent to last year's total of 566, down 34% from 2019. In this year's first half, Airbus delivered 297 aircraft after a surge in June, putting it on course to exceed full-year targets given its pattern of speeding deliveries late in the year, according to industry sources and some analysts. read more Internally, the planemaker is provisionally aiming for more than 600 deliveries this year, several sources said. Deliveries are vital for aerospace companies because they mark the point at which the bulk of a jet's value - ranging from $40 million or more - reaches the manufacturer's coffers and help defray huge development costs. The task of keeping up deliveries has emerged as the number one priority for Airbus' commercial and financing teams, previously focused on winning ever-more multi-billion-dollar plane deals. Traditional order hype at now-cancelled air shows has given way to concerns about whether planes announced at previous events will be delivered, particularly among southeast Asian carriers widely said to have over-ordered jets in the past. At the same time, Airbus faces increased demand for planes like the best-selling A321neo in later years, because of the woes facing rival Boeing's recently grounded 737 MAX and a tide of planes pushed back this year to delivery dates mid-decade. To ensure deliveries, Airbus has, in some cases, agreed advances to carriers, delivery deferrals and, in several cases, financial deals allowing cash payments to be decoupled from the transfer of ownership, at least temporarily, industry sources said. Under these so-called advance delivery agreements, Airbus is paid virtually in full but the asset may not immediately wind up on the airline's books, delaying the point at which it must start absorbing depreciation charges on its bottom line. The aircraft is meanwhile temporarily stored. Sources said the mechanism, which can involve financial third parties, has been approved by auditors because it includes an irrevocable commitment to transfer ownership of the aircraft at a specific date, while Airbus receives enough to book a sale. Airbus had no immediate comment. DELIVERY NEGOTIATIONS Airbus and other manufacturers have also scrambled to simplify deliveries and in some cases offered to fly planes to airlines unable to send pilots due to travel restrictions. Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer told reporters in June that Airbus had fewer than five aircraft left without homes after month of crisis management with airlines, having reached out to customers as soon as lockdown paralysed demand. Rival Boeing (BA.N)New Tab posted its first quarterly profit in almost two years on Wednesday, as deliveries of its 737 MAX also gained traction. read more Even so, negotiations can be tough and more \"contractual\" than in the past, suspending the often clubby atmosphere of an industry dependent on long-term relationships, sources said. \"If you have a plane in production now, the pressure to take delivery is huge. If you have a delivery in the middle of the decade, Airbus would be happy for you to release it so that it can offer that slot to someone else,\" a senior financier said. In one compromise, Airbus booked an order for five A350 wide-bodied jets from Lufthansa in June, while simultaneously agreeing to cancel three previous orders. One source said the new order involved rowing back on earlier cancellation rights. The order reshuffle was part of a fleet restructuring that also saw Lufthansa buy five more competing Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 787s. read more Lufthansa denied, however, a media report that its chief executive Carsten Spohr had clashed by video call with his Airbus counterpart over payments for aircraft. Such matters are not typically discussed at CEO level, a spokesman said. \"There are always tough negotiations, but we have a good underlying partnership,\" he added.",

            "text": "U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo visits China for four days starting Sunday, aiming to boost business ties between the world's largest two economies even as the Biden administration has taken a series of steps to prevent exports of sensitive American technology. Raimondo has repeatedly said the United States does not want to \"decouple\" from China, but also noted she has aggressively placed Chinese companies on an export control list. \"There’s a lot of benefit to doing business (with China) where we can. Having said that, we have to protect what we must, and be eyes wide open about the threats and strategic competition,\" Raimondo said in July. Tensions are high as the United States works with allies to block China's access to vital equipment needed to keep its chip industry competitive and Beijing restricts shipments from prominent U.S. firms like planemaker Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and chip company Micron Technology (MU.O)New Tab . Ahead of Raimondo's arrival in Beijing on Sunday, several recent announcements from the U.S. have likely pleased Chinese officials. On Tuesday, China welcomed the U.S. decision to lift export control restrictions on 27 Chinese entities, saying it is conducive to normal trade between Chinese and U.S. firms. And on Wednesday the United States said it is seeking a six-month extension to a decades-old science and technology agreement with China, a deal Chinese officials have expressed a desire to extend. The two biggest economies in the world used to be each other's largest trade partners, but Washington is now trading more with neighboring Canada and Mexico, while Beijing is trading more with Southeast Asia. The visit comes after a blitz of intense diplomacy over several months by U.S. President Joe Biden’s top aides aimed at easing tensions between Washington and Beijing. Officials are hoping to see concrete signs of progress in the relationship, in potential areas ranging from trade to climate, in time for a potential face-to-face meeting between Biden and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping before the end of the year. The semiconductor chip industry is eager to protect its profits in China as the Biden administration considers another round of restrictions on chip exports to China. Last year, China accounted for $180 billion in semiconductor purchases, more than a third the worldwide total of $555.9 billion and the largest single market, according to Semiconductor Industry Association. Raimondo in May said the United States \"won't tolerate\" China's effective ban on purchases of Micron memory chips and is working closely with allies to address such \"economic coercion.\" Raimondo said in July the Biden administration is seeking to carefully target U.S. controls on exports to China, but rules will cost firms some revenue. Restrictions should not be so broad \"that you deny American companies revenue and China can get the product elsewhere, or China can get the product from other countries,\" Raimondo said. Rules \"will deny some revenue to American companies, but we think it's worth it.\" One big open question is when will China resume deliveries of Boeing 737 MAX passenger jets. Raimondo, who has spoken to Boeing executives on numerous occasions, said in 2021 the Chinese government was preventing its domestic airlines from buying U.S.-manufactured Boeing airplanes. \"There's tens of billions of dollars of planes that Chinese airlines want to buy, but the Chinese government is standing in the way,\" she said. Raimondo’s trip may be the last face-to-face interaction between top U.S. officials and their Chinese counterparts ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris’ Sept. 4-7 trip to the ASEAN meetings of Southeast Asian countries, Biden’s Sept. 7-10 trip to India for the Group of 20 meetings and the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations later in September. On the sidelines of those meetings, Biden and Harris are expected to spend time wooing neighboring countries anxious about China’s assertive posture in the Indo-Pacific and declining economy.",

Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.6% last month, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. These so-called core capital goods orders gained 1.3% in September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders climbing 0.5%. Part of the increase last month likely reflected higher prices amid global shortages of goods. Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.3% last month after advancing 1.3% in September. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement. Business spending on equipment contracted in the third quarter after four straight quarters of double-digit growth. It was weighed down a shortage of motor vehicles. A global shortage of semiconductors is undercutting motor vehicle production. Unfinished work continues to pile up at factories as manufacturers struggle with snarled supply chains. This, together with strong demand for goods even as spending reverts back to services, should keep manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the economy, humming. Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, fell 0.5% last month after declining 0.4% in September. They were depressed by a 2.6% drop in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 2.8% decline in September. Motor vehicle orders rebounded 4.8% after falling 2.2% in September Orders for the volatile civilian aircraft category tumbled 14.5% after plunging 31.2% in September.

            "text": "Security services searched the home of one of Ukraine's most prominent billionaires on Wednesday, moving against a figure once seen as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's sponsor in what the authorities called a wartime anti-corruption purge. The action, days before a summit with the European Union, appears to reflect determination by Kyiv to demonstrate that it can be a steward of billions of dollars in Western aid and shed a reputation as one of the world's most corrupt states. It came as Kyiv has secured huge pledges of weapons from the West in recent weeks offering new capabilities - the latest expected this week to include rockets from the United States that would nearly double the firing range of Ukrainian forces. Underlining Ukraine's need for more advanced arms, the country's deputy defence minister said late on Wednesday that fierce fighting was continuing in the east, where she said Russia had superiority in numbers of troops and weapons. Photos on social media appeared to show tycoon Ihor Kolomoiskiy dressed in a sweatsuit and looking on in the presence of an SBU security service officer at his home. Reuters could not immediately verify the images' authenticity. In a statement that did not name Kolomoiskiy, the SBU published the same photos, but with the person's face blurred. The SBU said it had uncovered the embezzlement of more than $1 billion at Ukraine's biggest oil company, Ukrnafta, and its biggest refiner, Ukrtatnafta. Kolomoiskiy, who has long denied wrongdoing, once held stakes in both firms, which Zelenskiy ordered seized by the state in November under martial law. Kolomoiskiy could not immediately be reached for comment. Separate raids were carried out at the tax office, and the home of Arsen Avakov, who led Ukraine's police force as interior minister from 2014-2021. \"Every criminal who has the audacity to harm Ukraine, especially in the conditions of war, must clearly understand that we will put handcuffs on his hands,\" Ukraine's security service chief Vasyl Malyuk was quoted as saying on the SBU Telegram channel. The infusion of Western military and financial aid creates new pressure on Zelenskiy to demonstrate his government can clean up Ukraine. Last week, he purged more than a dozen senior officials following a series of scandals and graft allegations in the biggest shakeup of Ukraine's leadership since the invasion. Following Wednesday's raids, the parliamentary leader of Zelenskiy's Servant of the People party, David Arakhamia, wrote on Telegram: \"The country will change during the war. If someone is not ready for change, then the state itself will come and help them change.\" Zelenskiy, who first came to fame as the star of a sitcom on Kolomoiskiy's TV station, has long promised to rid Ukraine of so-called oligarchs, but had faced accusations that he was unable to move decisively against his former sponsor. In an address overnight before the raids, he alluded to new anti-corruption measures in time for Friday's summit, which Kyiv sees as key to its hopes of one day joining the bloc - a more urgent goal since Russia's invasion almost a year ago. Ukrainian forces who recaptured swathes of territory from Russian troops in the second half of 2022 have seen their advance stall since November. Kyiv says the key to regaining the initiative is securing advanced Western weaponry. Two U.S. officials said a new $2 billion package of military aid to be announced as soon as this week would for the first time include Ground Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB), a new weapon designed by Boeing. (BA.N)New Tab The cheap gliding missiles can strike targets more than 150 km (90 miles) away, a large increase over the 80 km range of the rockets fired by HIMARS systems which changed the face of the war when Washington sent them last summer. That would put all of the Russian-occupied territory on Ukraine's mainland, as well as parts of the Crimea peninsula seized by Moscow in 2014, within range of Kyiv's forces. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the arrival of longer-range U.S. weapons would escalate the conflict. Western countries pledged scores of advanced main battle tanks for the first time last week, a breakthrough in support aimed at giving Kyiv the capability to recapture occupied territory this year. But the arrival of the new weapons is still months away, and in the meantime Russia has gained momentum on the battlefield, announcing advances north and south of the city of Bakhmut, its main target for months. Kyiv disputes many of those claims and Reuters could not independently verify the full situation, but the locations of reported fighting clearly indicate incremental Russian advances. Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said that Russian forces were trying to gain ground near the strategic town of Lyman and that, despite heavy losses, were also pressing ahead with an offensive near Bakhmut and Avdiivka. South of Bakhmut, Russia has also launched a major new offensive this week on Vuhledar, a longstanding Ukrainian-held bastion at the junction of the southern and eastern front lines. Kyiv says its forces have so far held there. ($1 = 0.9163 euros)",

Five of the 737 MAX jets Boeing handed to customers were for Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYA.I)New Tab , while United Parcel Service (UPS.N)New Tab took its last hump-backed 747-8 and Thai Airways (THAI.BK)New Tab took three 777-300ER jets, Boeing said. The 35 overall deliveries in April was down from the 41 jets it handed over in March but more than double the 17 planes in the year-ago period. read more The closely watched orders and deliveries monthly snapshot comes as Boeing struggles to overcome production flaws that snarled deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner for a year as well as certification risks on its forthcoming 737 MAX 10 and 777X jets. read more On Monday, Boeing won a respite from the woes affecting its core widebody programs, when Lufthansa (LHAG.DE)New Tab said it would buy 10 cargo planes including seven of the 777X version, also known as 777-8F. read more The carrier also boosted its order for Boeing 787s as part of a compensation deal for delays to the 777X passenger version. read more For April, Boeing booked 46 gross orders - including 44 for its 737 MAX from leasing companies and unidentified customers, and two 777 freighters, it said. After 34 order cancellations, including AerCap (AER.N)New Tab scrapping two 787-10 jets, and instances where buyers swapped jet models, orders for April stood at 12. For the year through April, Boeing booked 213 gross orders, or 157 after cancellations and conversions. After accounting adjustments, Boeing recorded 98 net orders for the year so far. Overall, Boeing's order backlog rose to 4,218 from 4,176, Boeing said.",

            "text": "Technology startup Epirus, which is competing with Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab and others to supply drone-zapping weapons to the U.S. military, has raised $200 million in a private transaction that lifts its valuation to $1.35 billion, the company told Reuters. The cash infusion comes as the United States scrambles to develop countermeasures against widely available commercial drones that military and law-enforcement officials say pose mounting tactical threats to everything from military bases and refineries to mass gatherings like Sunday's NFL Super Bowl. Militias and insurgent groups including Islamic State have rigged off-the-shelf drones with explosives to attack high-profile targets including commercial ships and armored combat vehicles. Last month, Iraq's air defenses shot down two explosive-laden drones as they approached the Ain al-Asad air base, which hosts U.S. forces, west of Baghdad. \"I am very concerned about it,\" Marine General Kenneth McKenzie, the head of U.S. Central Command, told a congressional committee last year. \"Small, commercially available drones are one of the most persistent and dangerous threats that we see in the (Middle East),\" McKenzie said. The proliferation of cheap drones has raised the need to find an alternative to traditional aerial defenses, such as surface-to-air missiles, which can cost $3 million apiece. Torrance, California-based Epirus joins a number of aerospace juggernauts developing so-called directed-energy weapons of varying size and cost that zap unmanned aerial vehicles using lasers or microwaves. A 300-kilowatt, ground-based laser being developed by Boeing and General Atomics targets drones as well as missiles and aircraft. Raytheon Technologies Corp and KBR Inc (KBR.N)New Tab unit Kord Technologies last year won a $123 million contract to supply the U.S. Army with 50-kilowatt lasers mounted to eight-wheeled Stryker combat vehicles. Epirus has partnered with General Dynamics Corp to install a microwave-pulsing weapon on the Stryker vehicles. Its portfolio includes a ground-based microwave cannon called Leonidas and a smaller Pod version that can be carried in a pack or mounted to a drone. It declined to discuss the kilowatt strength of its products. Epirus raised $200 million in Series C funding from 8VC, Bedrock, Broom Ventures and General Dynamics Land Systems, among other investors, the company said. An announcement was expected later on Tuesday. Deployment of the technology above U.S. air space has been held off by Federal Aviation Administration regulations that prohibit interfering with commercial aircraft, a category that so far includes commercial drones. The Pentagon has given U.S. military bases the green light to shoot down private and commercial drones that could endanger aviation safety or pose other threats.",

The world's largest commercial helicopter maker said the order from Verona-based Air Corporate at the EBACE show in Geneva included 40 light single-engine H125/130 and three ACH160, a corporate version of its latest H160 medium model. Airbus Helicopters said in a statement the helicopters would be delivered over coming years for various private and business passenger services as well as utility operations. Airbus Helicopters is a division of planemaker Airbus, whose chief executive Guillaume Faury said last month the market for civil helicopters was recovering from a low point in 2021 and 2022. Profits are particularly driven by services, he said. Now in its fifth decade, the H125/130 Ecureuil or Squirrel family is the world's most-sold helicopter. The medium-sized utility H160 was approved by Europe in 2020 and has since been cleared in Brazil and Japan. Airbus Helicopters is waiting for certification in the United States, where aerospace approvals have slowed since the Boeing 737 jetliner crisis. In April, GDAT, one of China's biggest helicopter lessors, signed up for 50 H160 helicopters.",

            "text": "(This Dec. 3 story corrects speed of Wisk vehicle and company ownership in paras 4 and 6) Paramedics with jetpacks, border police in flying cars and city workers commuting by drone all sound like science fiction - but the concepts are part of a advanced air mobility (AAM) market that is expected to be worth as much as $17 billion by 2025. As urbanisation leaves city streets congested and advances in technology allow for vehicles considered impossible just decades ago, using the sky for small-scale aircraft has become increasingly attractive. \"We can't continue to use road transport; 3D mobility is really important,\" Anna Kominik, Asia Pacific Director at Wisk, said in an interview broadcast on Thursday at the Reuters Next conference. Wisk, a joint venture between Boeing Co. and Kitty Hawk Corp., has been testing Cora, an autonomous electric aircraft that takes off and lands like a helicopter, at its base in Tekapo, New Zealand, for four years. Wisk is liaising with regulators, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, to get approval for public use of the air taxi, which can carry two passengers about 40 kilometres plus reserves (25 miles) at speeds of about 160 km/h. \"Sixty-seven percent of the world's population will be cities by 2030 ,so that ground infrastructure can't keep up and is costly to overhaul,\" Kominik said in a panel discussion recorded on Nov. 5. \"We have to move to the sky as a resource.\" Netherlands-based PAL-V is keeping one foot on the ground while taking to the air. Its two-seat gyroplane road vehicle Liberty, which has a maximum speed of 180 km/h and a flying range of 400 km, received approval for use on European roads this year. Delivery to customers will begin in 2023 after they complete the required training, said Robert Dingemanse, chief executive of PAL-V International. He added that PAL-V had orders, including down payments, from 15 countries, with interest from 193 countries. Kominik declined to put a timetable on when Cora would carry its first passengers. \"We don't expect we will be the first to market; we do expect to be the best,\" she said. The advanced air mobility market could be worth almost $17 billion by 2025 and $110 billion by 2035, according to Allied Market Research. The same report suggests the piloted segment will hold more than three-quarters of the market share in 2025, but the autonomous segment will grow fastest between 2025 and 2035. Dingemanse said he expected the Liberty to be used for a range of applications, including pipeline observation, policing and health operations in remote areas. Similarly, Richard Browning has already done trial runs of his Gravity jetpack with militaries in several countries and emergency response personnel in the United Kingdom. With 317 pounds of thrust, the jetsuit can carry a person for about four minutes. The company is working on updates to extend flying time, and Browning has built up a dataset of the jetpack's use across 35 countries. Kominik said the creation of an \"ecosystem\" of use cases was critical as the industry and technology develops. \"That requires a very different mindset from government policy, regulators and community,\" she said. \"We have to create that, because it's not there at the moment. California-based Wisk selected New Zealand because it was unique globally in allowing \"beyond line of sight\" trials of autonomous aircraft. Dingemanse and Kominik said the pandemic had helped and hurt the industry. Sales of the PAL-V slowed as in-person test drives became restricted, Dingemanse said, but the crisis has provided a boost to the private jet industry and reinforced the human need to meet face-to-face. \"In that sense, it is an advantage to our solution, which is personal space when you're travelling,\" he said. Kominik said New Zealand's tight border restrictions had prevented some key personnel from entering over the past several months, but also spurred the opening of a new testing site in Australia. Browning is keen to return to public demonstrations to inspire a new generation: \"Landing a 1,000 horsepower jetsuit amongst a school - with an invitation of course - is a pretty good way to stop kids from looking at an iPad for a moment.\" To watch the Reuters Next conference, please register here https://reutersevents.com/events/next/New Tab ",

            "text": "A dispute between Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and Qatar Airways over grounded A350 jets rose to the attention of French and Qatari leaders, according to a French official and internal Airbus emails recently released as part of a UK court battle. The two leaders discussed the issue last December during a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron to Doha, the French official told Reuters on Wednesday. Reuters was unable to determine the nature or outcome of the discussion. The exchange marks the first confirmation that a bitter contractual and safety dispute spilled beyond the courtroom. The dispute has led to fractured ties between the two companies and the unprecedented cancellation of large-scale orders. \"(We) confirm that the subject was brought up along with other aspects of the bilateral economic relationship,\" the official said, speaking on behalf of Macron's office. Qatar's government communications office declined any comment on the matter. The French official was responding to a Reuters query about previously unreported emails released last month in court documents as part of the UK court fight between Qatar Airways and Airbus over combined claims for damages approaching $2 billion. The emails were supplied to the airline by Airbus under legal disclosure procedures ahead of a provisionally scheduled mid-2023 trial, barring a settlement before then. Airbus declined to comment on Thursday ahead of a new procedural hearing in a division of the High Court in London on Friday. A spokesperson for Qatar Airways could not immediately be reached for comment. The airline says widespread paint cracking has exposed deeper surface damage on the jets, prompting it to stop taking deliveries. Qatar's national regulator also progressively grounded 29 planes on safety concerns over the past year. Airbus has acknowledged quality problems with its premier long-haul model but denies any risk to safety and has cancelled all outstanding new business with Qatar Airways, which has increased purchases from rival Boeing (BA.N)New Tab . The dispute marks a public divorce at the heart of the $150 billion jet industry with billions of dollars at stake. Alongside the legal process, Airbus has also discussed plans internally to advance its case on multiple political, regulatory and commercial fronts, according to several emails disclosed as part of preparatory hearings. \"Political: visit of Mr Macron & (Airbus CEO) Guillaume Faury last weekend with the Sheik(h). Could bring some levers, not yet seen,\" a senior Airbus engineer wrote in an email to Chief Technical Officer Sabine Klauke on Dec. 8 last year. Macron met the Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, five days earlier to mark 50 years of ties with a key economic ally. The two leaders also held a lunch meeting in Paris in May. Some European diplomats told Reuters that pressure to maintain good relations with Qatar is increasing as the continent heads for a winter of energy shortages, with Qatar seen as an alternative gas supplier to Russia. The Dec. 8 email was included in a publicly available witness statement submitted by the airline along with documents for a preliminary hearing in October. Other emails suggest parallel negotiations began as early as last December just as the legal fight was becoming public. \"The last 2 aspects (political and commercial) should be continued in parallel to find a quick escape of the crisis with a win-win situation,\" according to the Dec. 8 Airbus email.",

            "text": "NASA launched a first-of-its kind mission on Saturday to study Jupiter's Trojan asteroids, two large clusters of space rocks that scientists believe are remnants of primordial material that formed the solar system's outer planets. The space probe, dubbed Lucy and packed inside a special cargo capsule, lifted off on schedule from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 5:34 a.m. EDT (0934 GMT), NASA said. It was carried aloft by an Atlas V rocket from United Launch Alliance (UAL), a joint venture of Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N)New Tab . Lucy's mission is a 12-year expedition to study a record number of asteroids. It will be the first to explore the Trojans, thousands of rocky objects orbiting the sun in two swarms - one ahead of the path of giant gas planet Jupiter and one behind it. The largest known Trojan asteroids, named for the warriors of Greek mythology, are believed to measure as much as 225 kilometers (140 miles) in diameter. Scientists hope Lucy's close-up fly-by of seven Trojans will yield new clues to how the solar system's planets came to be formed some 4.5 billion years ago and what shaped their present configuration. Believed to be rich in carbon compounds, the asteroids may even provide new insights into the origin of organic materials and life on Earth, NASA said. \"The Trojan asteroids are leftovers from the early days of our solar system, effectively the fossils of planet formation,\" principal mission investigator Harold Levison of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, was quoted by NASA as saying. No other single science mission has been designed to visit as many different objects independently orbiting the sun in the history of space exploration, NASA said. As well as the Trojans, Lucy will do a fly-by of an asteroid in the solar system's main asteroid belt, called DonaldJohanson in honor of the lead discoverer of the fossilized human ancestor known as Lucy, from which the NASA mission takes its name. The Lucy fossil, unearthed in Ethiopia in 1974, was in turn named for the Beatles hit \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\" Lucy the asteroid probe will make spaceflight history in another way. Following a route that circles back to Earth three times for gravitational assists, it will be the first spacecraft ever to return to Earth's vicinity from the outer solar system, according to NASA. The probe will use rocket thrusters to maneuver in space and two rounded solar arrays, each the width of a school bus, to recharge batteries that will power the instruments contained in the much smaller central body of the spacecraft.",

            "text": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan Just as markets were getting all antsy again about regional U.S. banks, Big Tech mega caps seem to have calmed the investment world with cloud-covered earnings beats and giddy talk of the quantum leap in artificial intelligence. After Tuesday's bank stress echo seeded the worst day on Wall St in over a month, Microsoft (MSFT.O)New Tab stock soared almost 10% ahead of Wednesday's open following a first-quarter profit beat that was driven by demand for its cloud computing, productivity software and AI products. Alphabet (GOOGL.O)New Tab also gained 1% as it too trumpeted gains in cloud services and AI, alongside plans for a $70 billion buyback. With Meta (META.O)New Tab results out later, its stock was up 2% and Amazon (AMZN.O)New Tab raced ahead 4%. Apple AAPL.0 reports next week, with some eyes on its move into financial services as it muscles in on high-yield savings accounts that pander to jittery depositors. Judged by another near 50% drop in First Republic's already battered shares on Tuesday - amid reports of asset sales to fill the $100 billion hole in deposits that it reported from the March blowup - that banking instability smoulders. But despite the fresh wobble across banking indices on Tuesday, it wasn't all bad news in the sector. PacWest Bancorp's (PACW.O)New Tab shares jumped 15% in extended trading after the regional lender said deposits have been building recently. And in Europe, Standard Chartered (STAN.L)New Tab shares bucked otherwise dour markets on a forecast-beating 21% jump in first-quarter profits. And while the blizzard of corporate earnings this week makes it hard to see the wood for the trees, the aggregate readout on first quarter S&P500 earnings shows almost 80% of firms beating forecasts so far and the estimated annual profit contraction ebbing to 3.9% from more than 5% earlier this month. The relatively mixed picture was also reflected in the incoming macro numbers - where a drop in April consumer confidence contrasted with further signs of a rebound in housing. Overall, the news saw S&P500 futures gain 0.5% before the bell - recouping some of Tuesday's 1.5% drop and offsetting modest losses on many Asian and European bourses. Simmering nerves about the looming U.S. debt ceiling standoff persisted, however, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen again warning of 'economic catastrophe' if the debt cap is not lifted and U.S. sovereign credit default swaps creeping higher. The U.S. House of Representatives could on Wednesday vote on a bill to sharply cut spending for a decade in exchange for a short-term hike in the debt ceiling, though it is unclear if it has enough support in the Republican majority to pass. The implications of Republicans being unable to agree a bill that even gets through the House - as it will likely fail in a Democrat-led Senate anyway - offers markets the prospect of the debt ceiling being hit without any real negotiations, leaving it down to a thin Republican majority in the house whether to force a crisis or vote to lift the cap and fight another day. U.S. Treasury markets continued to rally, with yields on 2-year notes dropping below 4% Tuesday and testing 3.9% early today. With the bank reverberations and debt ceiling uncertainty in the background, near certainty on one more Federal Reserve interest rate rise next month weakened at bit too - as futures cut the chances of another quarter-point hike to 80%. The dollar fell back across the board. Events to watch out for on Wednesday: * U.S. March durable goods orders, wholesale/retail inventories, advance trade balance * U.S. corp earnings: Meta, eBay, CME, Boeing, Thermo Fisher Scientific, American Tower, Boston Scientific, Vale, SK Hynix, Hess, Universal Music, Hilton, EQT, Roku, KLA, Pioneer Natural Resources, Teradyne, Align, General Dynamics, Norfolk Southern, Otis Worldwide, Dover, ADP, Allegion, MAsco, Humana etc * European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos speaks; Bank of Canada releases policy minutes * U.S. Treasury auctions 5-year note, 2-yr floating rate note * South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol meets U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington",

            "title": "Airlines try to leverage Boeing woes despite lack of alternatives",
            "text": "Airline executives are frustrated with Boeing (BA.N)New Tab as its safety crisis has upended their business plans. But in a tight market for large aircraft supplied by two companies, they have little choice but do business with the U.S. planemaker. Despite some public displays of alarm - United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab CEO Scott Kirby flew to France to talk with Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab as Boeing's latest crisis erupted - carriers are still negotiating new plane orders, looking to leverage Boeing's delays to secure better terms. Boeing's delivery schedule faces extended delays following a Jan. 5 mid-flight cabin blowout that exposed problems with safety and quality control in its manufacturing processes. But rival Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab already has a backlog of orders that makes shifting over a non-starter. Instead, airlines are adopting a variety of strategies to try to stay in the game with Boeing, using orders of one type of plane as a placeholder to possibly take deliveries of a different model. They also are negotiating harder, looking to use production delays to get discounts from the planemaker on new orders and compensation for financial losses. \"Boeing customers don't have much option but to stick with Boeing whether they like it or not,\" said Scott Hamilton, managing director at aviation consulting firm Leeham Company. Kirby has been among the most vocal in expressing frustrations with Boeing. He met with Airbus after regulators grounded all of United's Boeing 737 MAX 9 fleet and put a big question mark over certification of the larger variant MAX 10, which was due for deliveries this year and was to be the cornerstone of United's fleet. United has ordered 277 MAX 10 jets with options for another 200, but the tumult at Boeing moved the company to look at Airbus' A321neo jets as an alternative. Those talks raised the specter of Boeing losing one of its most loyal customers. However, Airbus' order book is full through 2030. On Tuesday, Kirby said United wants A321 jets but is not willing to overpay for them. Now, there is growing realization inside United that the carrier won't be able to find one solution to its MAX 10 problem, a person familiar with the matter said. Instead, United is looking to use the delayed Boeing order to extract better deals for other planes, the person said. United has asked Boeing to start building MAX 9s for delivery and plans to convert those orders into MAX 10s once that aircraft is certified, Kirby said. Several weeks ago, American Airlines (AAL.O)New Tab CEO Robert Isom blasted Boeing for its persistent quality issues, asking the jet manufacturer to get its act together. Last week, it placed its first-ever order for MAX 10 jets to secure an alternative to its Airbus A321 planes. The Texas-based carrier has had to deal with Boeing's delivery delays, including for the 787 Dreamliner, which not only hampered its efforts to capitalize on the post-pandemic travel rebound, but also drove up its costs. In return for a vote of confidence for the troubled MAX 10 program, Chief Financial Officer Devon May said American had negotiated options to convert those orders into MAX 8s or MAX 9s. Its supply contract also provides for financial compensation from Boeing for delivery delays. For airlines like Southwest (LUV.N)New Tab , one of Boeing's primary customers, transitioning away from Boeing is tantamount to changing their business model. It would entail heavy investments in maintenance, training and technologies. Airbus has long tried to woo Southwest with its smaller A220 as a substitute for Boeing's delayed MAX 7. But CEO Bob Jordan said the cost of operating multiple fleets is \"significant.\" \"A strong Boeing is great for Southwest Airlines,\" Jordan said at JP Morgan's industrial conference on Tuesday. \"It's great for our industry.\"",

In a 3-0 decision, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans said four classes of passengers who claimed they were overcharged on nearly 200 million Southwest and American Airlines (AAL.O)New Tab tickets over 18 months could not prove they were harmed, depriving federal courts of jurisdiction. Brian Dunne, whose law firm represented the plaintiffs, declined to comment. Boeing and Southwest did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide after 346 people died in the October 2018 crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia and March 2019 crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in Ethiopia. Passengers accused Southwest, Boeing's launch customer for the MAX 8, of pressuring Boeing into deceiving Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officials during the testing and certification process, ostensibly to lower pilot training costs. They also alleged that the companies misled the FAA about a Boeing aircraft stability system that took control of both planes and improperly pushed their noses down. Passengers said they overpaid for tickets on Southwest and American, which also flew the MAX 8, because demand and prices on the plane's routes would have fallen if the truth had been known. Circuit Judge Andrew Oldham, however, said the plaintiffs at most complained of a \"past risk of physical injury to which they were allegedly exposed because of defendants' fraud,\" and lacked standing because that risk never materialized. He also said \"if anything, plaintiffs are likely better off financially\" because they would have to pay more on other flights had the MAX 8 been taken out of service sooner. In January 2021, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion to resolve a U.S. Department of Justice criminal probe into the 737 MAX crashes. The case is Earl et al v Boeing Co et al, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-40720.",

After a four-day visit largely filled with long sessions in rooms with Chinese government officials, Raimondo got a quick tour of the Disney park. \"It's an important form of soft power for the U.S.,\" Raimondo said. \"It's an iconic U.S. brand, it's gorgeous.\" Raimondo, who was accompanied by U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns, confessed she had never before been to a Disney park but said she had seen all of the animated Disney movies. \"How cool is this?\" she said. Disney has emphasized its Chinese links since Shanghai Disneyland - a joint venture with state-owned Shendi Group - opened in 2016. Its attractions include a Chinese-style Wandering Moon tea house, a Chinese Zodiac-themed garden and a Tarzan musical featuring Chinese acrobats. But there was plenty of American culture on display - a Taylor Swift song playing on a loudspeaker, Wolfgang Puck pizza and Mickey Mouse everywhere. At one point, a seven-year-old Chinese girl wagging the tail of her LinaBell costume ran over a gave Raimondo a big hug and the pair spoke in English. Raimondo has said that boosting tourism between the two countries was one objective of her visit to China. On her last day in China, she also met with students to New York University and spoke to a women's business group. She ends her trip with a press conference at a Boeing facility in Shanghai in a hanger. One big open question is when will China resume deliveries of Boeing 737 MAX passenger jets after more than four years. Raimondo said in 2021 the Chinese government was preventing its domestic airlines from buying U.S.-manufactured Boeing airplanes. She said on Tuesday she had raised the airplane issue in meetings with the Chinese government but won no commitments.",

The carrier has increased the number of planned new orders to 250 aircraft and also plans to increase the number of destinations to 165 from 70, al-Mohanna was reported saying. The acceleration in the airline's growth plans, which coincides with ambitions by Saudi Arabia to develop its airline industry and become a hub for tourism, was first reported by Bloomberg. Flynas, part-owned by the investment firm of Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, was launched as Nas Air in 2007 with an all-Airbus fleet. The Riyadh-based discount carrier, which competes with state-owned Saudi carrier flyadeal, ordered 80 A320neo-family jets in 2017, with purchasing options for 40 more. In November, the airline's chief executive said flynas was in talks to exercise some or all of the 40 options, and industry sources said it had already reached an agreement that would see some of those extra planes include the long-range A321XLR model. As of the end of February, flynas operated a partially leased fleet of 39 Airbus jets, with further 76 yet to be delivered from the manufacturer, according to Airbus data.",

The deal includes 85 Airbus A321neo jets, 85 Boeing 737 MAX 10s and 90 Embraer E175 aircraft. The order also includes options and purchase rights for an additional 193 aircraft. \"(Travel) demand is back,\" American Airlines' CEO, Robert Isom, told an investor conference. The order is also a big boost for Boeing, which has been under fire since a Jan. 5 incident when a door plug blew off a 737 MAX plane in mid-flight, exposing frightened passengers to the outside air. This is American's first-ever order for the MAX 10, the largest variant of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle 737 MAX planes. The aircraft has yet to be certified by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The Jan. 5 incident has raised new doubts over its certification. American's chief financial officer, Devon May, said the order reflects the airline's confidence in Boeing, adding it offers fleet flexibility to the company as it provides an alternative to its Airbus A321 planes. Its first MAX 10 plane is due for delivery in 2028. But if delivery is delayed, the company has negotiated with Airbus for sufficient options, he said. The Texas-based airline also has options to convert those orders into MAX 8 or MAX 9. \"Our first MAX 10 delivery is going to happen in 2028,\" May told reporters on the sidelines of American's investor conference. \"It gives Boeing a lot of time to actually get the airplane certified and then deliver it on time.\" Reuters has reported that rival United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab is in talks with Airbus for a potential mega order to replace hundreds of MAX 10s on order from Boeing, as airlines scramble for scarce Airbus production slots. May expressed confidence that Boeing would \"get it right,\" saying the U.S. planemaker was \"taking the right steps.\" \"It's probably going to take some time,\" he said. American Airlines shares fell 5.4% to close at $14.81 on Monday. The new plane order is expected to enable American to add more high-margin premium seats on its domestic and short-haul international routes. American, United and Delta Air Lines (DAL.N)New Tab have all benefited from increased demand for premium travel after the pandemic. The company is also looking to drive up revenue from its co-branded credit cards. The programs have become a cash-generator for carriers through sale of miles to third-party partners. American expects its profit margin to jump to 15%-18% in 2026, up from 14% estimated for this year, resulting in a free cash flow of more than $3 billion.",

            "text": "Boeing must develop a comprehensive plan to address \"systemic quality-control issues\" within 90 days, the head of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday, after a mid-air emergency last month sparked renewed safety concerns. The head of the FAA demanded the plan in a statement critical of the planemaker following an all-day meeting with CEO Dave Calhoun on Tuesday. \"Boeing must commit to real and profound improvements,” FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said. \"Making foundational change will require a sustained effort from Boeing’s leadership, and we are going to hold them accountable every step of the way, with mutually understood milestones and expectations.\" Calhoun said in a statement Boeing's leadership team was \"totally committed\" to addressing FAA concerns and developing the plan. \"We have a clear picture of what needs to be done,\" Calhoun said. \"Boeing will develop the comprehensive action plan with measurable criteria that demonstrates the profound change that Administrator Whitaker and the FAA demand.\" Boeing has scrambled to explain and strengthen safety procedures after a door panel detached during a Jan. 5 flight on a brand new Alaska Airlines (ALK.N)New Tab 737 MAX 9, forcing pilots to make an emergency landing while passengers were exposed to a gaping hole 16,000 feet above the ground. Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday the Justice Department is scrutinizing the Alaska Airlines MAX 9 blowout to determine if it falls under a 2021 deferred-prosecution agreement over two fatal 737 MAX 8 crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people. If prosecutors determine the MAX 9 blowout is a breach of that agreement, Boeing could face criminal liability, the report said, citing an unidentified source. Boeing said last month the DOJ was currently considering whether the company fulfilled its obligations under the agreement. The Justice Department declined to comment on Wednesday. Boeing shares fell 1% in after-hours trading. Boeing's production rate has been capped by the FAA and its operations closely scrutinized by lawmakers and customers following the Jan. 5 incident. The new FAA statement raises fresh questions about how long the production rate freeze will last. Whitaker said Boeing's plan must incorporate forthcoming results of the FAA production-line audit and findings from an expert review panel report released on Monday. That report, which had been commissioned in early 2023, was highly critical of the company's safety management processes, saying Boeing suffered from \"inadequate and confusing implementation of the components of a positive safety culture.\" Boeing last week abruptly removed Ed Clark, the head of its troubled 737 MAX program, as part of a management shakeup. The FAA said on Wednesday that Boeing must take steps to improve its Safety Management System (SMS) program, which it committed to in 2019 and combine it with a Quality Management System to \"create a measurable, systemic shift in manufacturing quality control.\" Whitaker visited Boeing's Renton, Washington, factory, where the 737 MAX line is produced, on Feb. 12. He expressed concerns about some things he saw on the tour, two people briefed on the matter told Reuters. The FAA meetings with Calhoun lasted more than seven hours, sources said, and much of it focused on a series of quality issues at the planemaker. The participants included Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal, the planemaker's new head of quality Elizabeth Lund and Mike Fleming, Boeing senior vice president and general manager, airplane programs. \"Boeing must take a fresh look at every aspect of their quality-control process and ensure that safety is the company’s guiding principle,\" Whitaker said. The Alaska Airlines mishap is Boeing's second major crisis in recent years, after the crashes in 2018 and 2019 prompted a grounding of the 737 MAX for 20 months that damaged Boeing's reputation. The door panel that flew off the MAX 9 appeared to be missing four key bolts, according to a preliminary report this month from the U.S. National Safety Transportation Board. The panel is a plug in place on some MAX 9s instead of an additional emergency exit. The FAA panel report referenced the recent issues, saying it amplified concerns that \"safety-related messages or behaviors are not being implemented across the entire Boeing population.\" Airline industry executives have expressed frustration with Boeing's quality control. France's Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab , the only other major manufacturer of commercial jets, in January reported record annual jet orders and confirmed an 11% rise in 2023 deliveries, maintaining the top manufacturing spot against Boeing for a fifth year. The door plug blowout led to a weeks-long grounding of the MAX 9 in January and angered Boeing's airline customers. Some, including Alaska Airlines, announced they would conduct enhanced quality oversight of planes before they leave the Boeing factory.",

            "text": "India's anti-terrorism agency has filed a case against a Sikh separatist leader for warning Air India passengers that their lives were in danger and threatening not to let the flag carrier operate anywhere in the world. The agency said security forces were on alert after the threats by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who acts as general counsel of Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a group campaigning to establish an independent Sikh homeland called Khalistan carved out of India. The case against Pannun has been registered under provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967 and sections of the Indian Penal Code, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) said in a statement on Monday. \"Pannun threatened that Air India would not be allowed to operate in the world ... in his video messages, released on Nov. 4,\" it said, adding that he had urged Sikhs not to travel on Air India flights from Sunday, \"claiming a threat to their lives\". Reuters has not independently verified the video messages, which were widely shared on social media this month. Pannun told Reuters in an emailed response that his message was to \"boycott Air India not bomb\" and that the Indian government was engaging in a disinformation tactic to \"crush freedom of expression\". He added that the \"government can not stop SFJ from running secessionist Khalistan referendum, which is the real motive why NIA filed frivolous terror case.\" Air India declined to comment on the matter. The NIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The demand for Khalistan has resurfaced many times, although it now has little support in India, which sees the movement as a security threat. A violent insurgency in the 1970s and 1980s by Sikh militants paralysed the northern state of Punjab, where Sikhs are a majority, for more than a decade. India banned the SFJ as an \"unlawful association\" in 2019, citing that it was involved in \"anti-national and subversive\" activities. It listed Pannun as an \"individual terrorist\" in 2020, stating that he was issuing appeals to \"Punjab-based gangsters and youth\" to fight for Khalistan. The interior ministry said that year that Pannun, originally from a village in Punjab, was residing in the United States. Media said he has citizenship of U.S. and Canada. Interpol has rejected two requests by India to issue a red corner noticeNew Tab against him, The Indian Express newspaper said in October last year. The SFJ says it has offices in Britain, Canada and U.S. The threats come as Canadian agencies investigate allegations linking India's agents to the killing of a Sikh separatist leader there, which has frayed ties between the two countries. India has rejected Canada's suspicions. In the wake of the threats, investigations have been launched in Canada, India and some other countries where the airline owned by the Tata Group conglomerate operates, the NIA said. Air India has previously been targeted by Sikh militants, who were blamed for a bombing in 1985 of its Boeing 747 aircraft flying from Canada to India that killed all 329 people aboard off the Irish coast. Pannun has also previously threatened to disrupt railways and thermal power plants in India, the agency said.",

            "text": "The Federal Aviation Administration has no \"specific timetable\" to certify the Boeing 737 MAX 7, the agency's top official told Reuters on Tuesday, despite the planemaker previously expecting that to occur by the end of this year. FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker said the agency will certify the smallest variant of the best-selling MAX when \"we have all the data that we need and it is safe.\" Whitaker added that he is making sure he is getting briefed \"on status, to understand the issues that are arising in that process\" on the MAX 7 and other projects. Whitaker said \"the issues are being worked and that will continue.\" Boeing declined to comment on whether its schedule projections had changed. \"We will follow the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process. The FAA will determine when all certification requirements are met,\" the company said. In October, company executives said its schedule remained unchanged. Boeing is also awaiting certification of the larger 737 MAX 10. Southwest Airlines (LUV.N)New Tab , the largest customer for the MAX 7, said last month it expected the FAA to certify the plane by April. Boeing is currently pursuing an exemption to certain regulations concerning the MAX 7's engine nacelle inlet structure and engine anti-ice system, which are the same as those used by the in-service MAX 8. The exemption - which would run until May 31, 2026 - would allow MAX 7 certification while Boeing also certifies design changes for both systems, necessary to fix issues involving the overheating of the engine anti-ice system that could cause structural damage to the engine nacelle. The FAA is accepting comments on the proposed exemption through Dec. 26. The FAA said last month it would require key flight control design changes to be considered \"major\" like the system involved in two fatal MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019. In late 2020, Congress passed sweeping legislation reforming how the FAA certifies new airplanes, including requiring manufacturers to disclose certain safety-critical information, such as information on systems that manipulate flight controls without direct pilot input or commands. A 2020 report from Congress said: \"Boeing failed in its design and development of the MAX, and the FAA failed in its oversight of Boeing and its certification of the aircraft.\" Whitaker said the FAA needs to \"be constantly looking for other ways to continuously improve the process, raising visibility of issues for certification as they come in.\" The FAA must also think about new technologies \"and how do we verify they are safe,\" he said. Whitaker said the MAX crashes caused the FAA to have a \"heightened level of vigilance.\"",

            "text": "Europe's no-frills airlines are heralding a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to grab market share from traditional carriers struggling to emerge from the pandemic, but each will have to overcome significant challenges to come out on top. Market leader Ryanair (RYA.I)New Tab this week saw talks over a mega-plane deal fall apart, while No.2 easyJet (EZJ.L)New Tab is lagging the recovery of its rivals so far. Smaller Wizz Air (WIZZ.L)New Tab has had an audacious bid for easyJet rejected, sources say, a move that would create a much stronger challenger to Ryanair if a deal could be done, but which some analysts think could be a distraction at a time of rapid change. At stake is potentially the biggest reshaping of Europe's aviation industry for a generation, with low-cost airlines looking to outmanoeuvre heavily indebted traditional carriers as COVID-19 travel restrictions are wound down. Ireland's Ryanair, with 150 million passengers in the year before the pandemic and 200 Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 737 MAX jets on order, had until this week looked set to extend its lead to the end of the decade with a deal for up to 250 more. But talks collapsed spectacularly on Monday, leaving boss Michael O'Leary - long wedded to both Boeing and a strategy of expanding organically - with few quick options to accelerate growth. read more That put the spotlight on Jozsef Varadi, CEO of Hungarian upstart Wizz Air, who sources say has made two bold moves to seize the initiative. read more Wizz, which flew just 40 million passengers at its pre-pandemic peak, is in talks to order at least 100 new Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab jets in addition to the 268 strong fleet it is due to have by 2027, sources told Reuters on Thursday. read more Sources also named Wizz as the mystery bidder behind a spurned approach to easyJet, which flew around 100 million passengers a year before the pandemic. read more That would tear up Wizz's ultra-low cost gospel of internal expansion at all costs for the sake of a major, instant step-up in scale. While easyJet said its suitor - which it did not name - was no longer interested, and Wizz declined to comment, the move highlighted the risks of easyJet's very different management approach. EasyJet has long been a hybrid player, focused on undercutting legacy airlines at established airports, while Wizz and Ryanair shun most hubs and focus on pared back fares that exclude other costs like baggage - the \"ultra-low-cost\" model. But some feel easyJet's decision to shrink - it has reduced its fleet by 10% in response to the pandemic - may have left it exposed, making its strategy a tougher sell to investors than the growth stories of its rivals. More reliant on Britain's slower travel recovery than most of the rest of Europe, easyJet is now also lagging the pick up in business at its main competitors. EasyJet \"are very different from what Wizz Air or Ryanair are offering the market at present. So in that sense they are kind of vulnerable as consolidation efforts occur post-COVID,\" said Joe Gill, head of origination at brokers Goodbody. After rejecting the bid, easyJet plans to raise 1.2 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) to stay in the race by funding growth at airports. It now has to convince investors to double down on its more cautious strategy just as a bid raises the prospect of a bolder alternative. Investor meetings this week are trying to win shareholders over to a dilutive rights issue, the second time easyJet has asked for cash during the crisis. The first time, its top shareholder and founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou did not take part. EasyJet says the funds will give it the firepower to grab slots at premium airports like Paris Orly, Lisbon, Milan Linate and London's Gatwick. But investors will be aware that any further COVID-19 restrictions could lead to another wash-out winter, swiftly burning through the new money. Industry sources say Varadi has long had easyJet in his sights. As well as creating a low-cost giant focused on Airbus planes, a combined Wizz-easyJet would add Wizz's low-cost bases in eastern Europe to prime easyJet hubs at Gatwick, as well as across France, Switzerland and elsewhere in western Europe. \"I think there is room for all three, but the question is, over time ... will Wizz come back again with another effort to deliver the consolidation which I think is practically inevitable,\" said aviation consultant John Strickland. With few cards to play, O'Leary on Wednesday started a game of chicken with Boeing by threatening to forgo any new order from the U.S. planemaker for up to a decade – implying he could happily survive with the 650 or so jets he will have when current deliveries complete in 2025. read more Observers see few alternatives to returning to the table with Boeing as relations with Airbus are strained and antitrust issues would likely preclude a bid for easyJet. In fact, O'Leary may welcome an easyJet tie-up as a distraction to Wizz. \"It would be good for Ryanair because it would put up Wizz’s costs,\" said a senior industry source. Fuelling the low-cost jostling is the fact the pandemic has tipped the industry balance in their favour and away from network carriers like Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA)New Tab , British Airways-owner IAG (ICAG.L)New Tab and Lufthansa (LHAG.DE)New Tab . During the pandemic, a lower cost base and more flexible business model has better protected no-frills players, while difficulties restarting long-haul travel have deepened this advantage. read more But the challenge for the budget brigade is to achieve growth in a way that does not dilute their cost advantage - either by overpaying for jets or acquiring a higher cost rival - a point made starkly by Wizz chairman and no-frills airline tycoon Bill Franke before the pandemic. \"Not staying disciplined about the business model and allowing other costs to leak in is the 'path to hell',\" Franke told Reuters.

            "text": "India is set to be the world's fastest growing major economy in the year ahead, as a post-pandemic retail boom and recent bank balance-sheet repairs lure new investment, fueling hot demand for everything from cars to televisions, coal and airliners. The world's fifth-largest economy is expected grow 6% in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, according to a survey by the Indian central bank this month. While slower than the current fiscal year's projected 6.8% growth, the outlook contrasts with bleaker 2023 projections in the United States, Europe and most noticeably China, a major Asian economic rival where a recent surge in COVID infections is expected to hobble activity next year. Importantly, conditions are better than not just the crippling slump during India's devastating COVID surge last year but also the anemic growth of the debt-saddled last decade. The more upbeat mood is shoring up spending and investment in India, although the recovery is expected to be an uneven one, benefiting the urban and domestic sectors more than struggling rural and export-oriented parts of the economy. \"If India does everything right, we could see significant foreign inflows in the next one to two years,\" said Sridhar Sivaram, investment director at Enam Holdings, a privately managed investment group. He is most bullish on Indian banks, which are having a \"Cinderella moment\" - a phrase popularised by billionaire-banker Uday Kotak, because of high credit demand and reduced defaults. India's weight in the MSCI emerging market index has already risen from 8% in 2019 to 16% as of October 2022, said Sivaram. Foreign portfolio investors sold a net of $18 billion this year but turned buyers in November and December, with financial stocks accounting for a third of the inflows last month. Longer term foreign direct investors have put in $22 billion into India between April-October 2022, on par with the previous year. Computer software, services firms, trading, non-conventional energy and chemicals made up more than half the inflows until September this year, government data shows. Economic activity picked up after a third wave of COVID infections in 2021, which was less severe than feared and led to most COVID restrictions being lifted, releasing pent-up demand for homes to cars and consumer goods in urban areas. Pradeep Bakshi, chief executive of consumer appliances company Voltas, said sales have been driven by a backlog of orders and easier financing options, such as buy-now-pay-later schemes, which reduce upfront payments for consumers. Demand for services such as hospitality, travel and leisure, rose 7.4% in the September quarter from the same period in 2019, before the COVID crisis hit, gross domestic product data showed. \"We are back in expansion mode with a vengeance, after a period when we didn't know whether we would survive,\" said Anjan Chatterjee, managing director at Specialty Restaurants, which runs eateries across the country. Overall, September quarter private consumption rose 7.8% from pre-COVID levels in 2019 while a sharp increase in government spending has pushed up fixed capital formation, an indication of investment activity, 13.5% from 2019, GDP data showed. India's re-opening is one reason power and coal demand is strong, pushing the government to step up gas imports, while more companies are seeking bank credit as they add capacity. Air India, for example, is looking at landmark orders for as many as 500 jetliners worth tens of billions of dollars from both Airbus and Boeing, Reuters reported this month. Not all indicators are signalling the same level of economic strength, however. Unemployment remains elevated at an average of 7.4% over the last 12 months till November compared with 6.3% in 2018-19 and 4.7% in 2017-18, the Centre For Monitoring Indian Economy estimates. High inflation, which is seen averaging 6.7% in 2022-23 by the central bank, has also hurt spending in rural areas where wage growth has not kept pace with urban areas and disposable incomes are lower. Production of non-durables goods, which include snacks and soap and are sensitive to shifts in rural demand, contracted more than 4% between April-October and by 13% in October alone, dragging overall manufacturing 5% lower that month. Slowing global demand is also starting to weigh on exports for items like textiles. However, broader optimism remains buoyed by the prospect of fresh private investment, after a decade that saw Indian corporations over-leveraged and banks saddled with bad loans, which made businesses reluctant to spend. Enam Holdings' Sivaram said order announcements have grown, although it usually takes about two years for \"a capex cycle to materialise into earnings\". There is also hope that global corporations will diversify supply chains away from China, which would benefit India. \"In the chemicals sector, we have seen this China-plus-one strategy play out quite well and we are positive on some of the companies in that sector,\" Sivaram said.",

The Chicago-based carrier said the latest wave of the health crisis has depressed near-term demand even as bookings for the spring and beyond remain strong. United said its priority is to match capacity with demand. As a result, its 2022 capacity is now projected to be lower than in 2019, instead of growing 5% as estimated earlier. It expects to restore 82% to 84% of pre-pandemic capacity in the quarter through March, with revenue recovering to just 75% to 80% of 2019 levels. Costs this year are now expected to be higher than in 2019, instead of going down. United's shares declined about 2.5% to $43.31 in extended trading. Rival Delta Air Lines (DAL.N)New Tab last week forecast a current-quarter loss due to the Omicron variant's impact on travel. Winter storms and an increase in COVID-19 infections among employees have led to mass flight cancellations. In one day alone, nearly one-third of United's workforce at Newark Liberty International Airport called in sick. Last week, the carrier said 3,000 employees were infected with the virus. read more In response, carriers have cut their flight schedules and are offering crew members not scheduled to work incentives to pick up additional shifts and trips. To ease staffing issues, United is offering its pilots premium pay through the end of the month. The incentives and flight cancellations are further inflating industry costs, which have gone up in the past year with efforts to ramp up operations. United estimated current-quarter costs to be 14% to 15% higher than in the same period in 2019. Analysts at Jefferies said cost pressures are expected to be a \"significant headwind\" for the carrier. United said its Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 777-200 planes equipped with Pratt & Whitney (PW) engines would begin to return to service in the current quarter. It had to ground the wide-body jets after a United flight to Honolulu suffered an engine failure and made an emergency landing last year in Denver. On an adjusted basis, the carrier reported a loss of $1.60 per share for the quarter through December, compared with a loss of $7.00 per share a year ago. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv, on average, had expected a quarterly loss of $2.11 per share. Fourth-quarter revenue came in at $8.19 billion, compared with $3.4 billion a year ago, beating the consensus estimate of $7.97 billion. United will discuss the results on a call with analysts and investors on Thursday morning.",

The company in May said it is targeting revenue growth of 10% in fiscal 2024 as it bets on finalising orders worth at least $480 billion in coming months. \"The company had a good start for FY24. The results are in line with the company's guidance as well as our estimates,\" said Harshit Kapadia, research analyst at rating agency Elara Securities. The Bengaluru-based company also benefited from the rising indigenisation of vessels as a part of the government's \"make in India\" push. HAL's shares closed almost flat after the results, taking its year-to-date gains to about 49%. ($1 = 82.8250 Indian rupees)",

            "text": "Alaska Airlines (ALK.N)New Tab is \"anxious\" to begin taking deliveries of the larger Boeing 737 MAX 10 to help it carry more passengers once the plane is certified, the carrier's CEO Ben Minicucci said on Wednesday. Boeing (BA.N)New Tab must first win approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for its smaller MAX 7 before it can get approval for the MAX 10. Both variants have faced major delays amid more intense regulatory scrutiny after criticism of the earlier certification process for the MAX 8, which suffered fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. \"Basically we like bigger airplanes,\" Minicucci said in an interview of the preference for the MAX 10, which can carry 189 passengers, up from 178 on the MAX 9. \"For essentially the same trip costs I put 11 more passengers on.\" In October, Alaska Airlines said it was exercising options to purchase 52 MAX aircraft for delivery between 2024 and 2027 and secured rights for 105 more planes through 2030. The company said on Wednesday it has 48 MAX 10s on order. \"We're anxious that it gets approved,\" Minicucci said. \"Of course it has to be safe and certified appropriately but we'll be a big fan of the -10 when it comes out.\" Boeing said on May 31 certification of the MAX 7 is taking a \"considerable amount of time\" due to new documentation requirements, but the planemaker still believes it can be approved by the end of the year. Both the MAX 7 and MAX 10 are seen as critical for Boeing to compete against Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab for orders at the smaller and larger ends of the narrowbody market. Minicucci said Alaska has a good relationship with Boeing, which builds the MAX near its Seattle headquarters and has been transparent about supply chain issues. \"They walked us through every production glitch that they've had,\" Minicucci said. \"We get briefings like every two weeks from these guys on where they are.\"",

            "text": "Boeing (BA.N)New Tab CEO Dave Calhoun met on Wednesday with several U.S. lawmakers on Capitol Hill, but two senators said he provided no answer about what caused the mid-air cabin panel blowout on a 737 MAX 9 this month and that congressional oversight will be needed. \"The American flying public and Boeing line workers deserve a culture of leadership at Boeing that puts safety ahead of profits,\" Senator Maria Cantwell said in a statement after meeting with Calhoun. A spokesperson for Cantwell said she was meeting with Calhoun at Boeing's request. The Senate Commerce Committee, which Cantwell chairs, will hold hearings to investigate the root causes of the safety lapse, she said. Asked about whether Boeing installed the plug door that blew out on the Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines flight, Senator Jerry Moran, the top Republican on the Commerce aviation safety subcommittee, told reporters in Washington that Boeing \"generally understand(s)\" the cause of the Jan. 5 blowout on an Alaska Airlines plane but is waiting for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to finalize its investigation. \"I did not learn what they believe that to be, but they did convince me that they are seriously trying to figure out the answer to that,\" he said. Moran represents Kansas, where Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N)New Tab makes the door plug that was torn off the MAX 9 in midair. Boeing declined to comment on the CEO's series of engagements on Capitol Hill, but Calhoun told reporters before one meeting that Boeing fully understands \"the gravity of the situation.\" \"We don't put planes in the air that we don't have 100% confidence in,\" Calhoun said. Calhoun's visits with lawmakers came as the NSTB announced plans to travel to Boeing's 737 factory in Renton, Washington, on Friday. The NTSB said it will examine documents on the MAX 9 plane that suffered the blowout, including those related to production, manufacturing and maintenance, allowing the organization to \"build a timeline from the early stages of production of the door plug to the accident flight.\" The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded most of those jets for checks after a plug replacing an unused exit door tore off an Alaska Airlines (ALK.N)New Tab plane on Jan. 5, forcing an emergency landing. Calhoun said senators had a lot of questions and vowed to be as transparent as possible in discussing the Alaska Airlines incident. He referred a question about a Seattle Times report that Boeing had removed a component called a door plug that blew out on that Alaska Airlines MAX 9 to the National Transportation Safety Board, which did not comment. \"We believe in our airplanes,\" Calhoun said. \"We have confidence in the safety of our airplanes.\" Moran said Calhoun indicated during the meeting that, no matter the root cause of the accident, \"Boeing is responsible because at the end of the day, they're the ones who are signing off and selling the airplane to a customer,\" FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker told Reuters this month that the agency was \"going through a process to work out how to restore confidence in the integrity of these plug doors.\" Cantwell and Senator Ted Cruz, the committee's top Republican, held a closed-door briefing last week on the grounding with FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker and NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy. Cruz will meet with Calhoun on Thursday. Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci told NBC News the airline found \"some loose bolts on many\" Boeing 737 MAX 9 jets during inspections. The FAA is still reviewing data from an initial group of 40 planes.",

            "text": "TUI's (TUI1n.DE)New Tab shareholders voted on Tuesday to remove Europe's largest travel operator from the London Stock Exchange in the latest blow to the UK market. Some 98.35% of votes were cast in favour of the delisting and just 1.65% against, after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results on the back of robust travel demand. Hanover-headquartered TUI has said having a single German listing will better reflect its ownership and trading patterns. The first quarter results initially sent the company's shares higher in Frankfurt and London, but they later fell back. TUI's departure is the latest blow to the London market after Britain's biggest chip company ARM floated in New York last year, and building supplies firm CRH and plumbing equipment company Ferguson shifted their main listings to the U.S. \"I think it's a retrograde step when a successful long standing heritage brand in travel moves away from a market like the UK where it has such a vested interest in terms of its high revenues from UK consumers,\" said Paul Charles, founder of the PC travel agency. TUI's London and Frankfurt listings resulted from the combination of Germany's TUI with Britain's First Choice Holidays in 2007. TUI reported an operating profit of 6 million euros ($6.5 million) in the three months to the end of December, versus a loss of 153 million in the year-earlier period and analysts' forecast for a loss of 102 million euros in an LSEG poll. Europe's airlines are entering 2024 with robust outlooks as travel demand is expected to surpass pre-pandemic levels despite economic uncertainty, delays in plane deliveries from manufacturers and rising jet fuel prices. TUI's first-quarter beat is a positive signal for the airline sector as a whole, an investor in other airlines, who did not wish to be named, said. The first half of TUI's fiscal year is usually weak with the bulk of annual profit coming from the April to September summer season. \"These updates highlight the strength of demand for holidays at present,\" Dudley Shanley, an analyst at Goodbody, said in a note. \"This summer should be very strong for ... the European airlines.\" TUI's shares jumped more than 7% in early trade in Frankfurt but ended little changed. The Frankfurt shares have dropped around a fifth since the start of 2023. The \"share performance was and is clearly unsatisfactory\", Chief Financial Officer Mathias Kiep told shareholders at the company's annual meeting on Tuesday. TUI maintained its forecast for a 25% increase in operating profit in the year to the end of September, and also set a medium-term target for a compound annual growth rate of 7%-10%. Deliveries of Boeing (BA.N)New Tab MAX 737 10 planes are expected to be delayed but MAX 737 8 planes on order should arrive on time, CEO Sebastian Ebel said on the call, adding some leasing deals had been extended to ensure capacity.

            "text": "The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has faulted Ethiopia's final report into the March 2019 Boeing 737 MAX fatal jetliner crash and said that country's investigators did not adequately address performance of the flight crew. NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said in an interview on Tuesday that Ethiopia's Aircraft Investigation Bureau (EAIB) had made errors in its report. \"We feel what they did not do is really delve into the flight crew performance issues and whether they were adequately prepared,\" Homendy said. \"We felt like it was not as comprehensive and robust as it could have been.\" The MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 in Indonesia and Ethiopia, which cost Boeing more than $20 billion, led to a 20-month grounding for the best-selling plane that was lifted by regulators after Boeing made software and pilot training changes. Boeing declined to comment Tuesday. The NTSB was not given a chance to review or comment on Ethiopia's final report before it was made public last month, a violation of rules overseen by the United Nations’ Montreal-based aviation agency, ICAO, Homendy said. \"It's unprecedented -- under ICAO we get a right to review the report and to provide comment,\" Homendy said. The NTSB comments released in December were in response to an earlier draft the board reviewed. The NTSB said earlier Ethiopian inspectors investigating the cause of the March 2019 Ethiopian Airlines' crash that killed 157 people did not pay enough attention to crew training and emergency procedures in their report. The EAIB blamed the accident on \"uncommanded\" inputs from Boeing's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, known as MCAS. The bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its final report last month focused solely on MCAS as the \"most probable cause\" and listed several contributing factors stemming from the plane's design or manufacturer procedures. The inputs, which were caused by faulty data from an angle of attack (AOA) sensor, sent the plane's nose down repeatedly, leading to loss of control as the pilots tried to deal with several warnings in the cabin, the report said. The NTSB said the Ethiopian report's finding that aircraft electrical problems caused erroneous AOA output was \"unsupported by evidence.\" The NTSB said it found the erroneous sensor output was likely caused by a bird strike soon after take-off from Addis Ababa. The NTSB added that the Ethiopia report's finding that MCAS documentation for flight crews was \"misleading since Boeing had provided the information to all 737 MAX operators four months before the Ethiopian Airlines crash.\" France's BEA air accident investigation agency, which read and analyzed the black boxes at the request of Ethiopia, has also taken issue with aspects of the Ethiopian report. It said earlier this month \"the operational and crew performance aspects are insufficiently addressed\". Ethiopian Airlines has consistently said its crew were not to blame and died trying to counter a flawed system. Boeing has apologized for MAX crashes and agreed to a settlement including a fine and compensation, while pledging internal safety reforms. Under international rules, the country where an air accident happens has sole control of the probe and official reports. It is not unusual for foreign agencies to append dissenting comments but it is rare for them to voice objections separately. The work of such civil safety agencies is not to decide liability, but instead to make recommendations that could prevent future accidents. The BEA said it agreed with Ethiopian findings on MCAS but that analyzing crew performance would prompt wider safety lessons.",

            "text": "A $2 billion legal battle between Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and Qatar Airways looks set to drag through most of 2023 after a UK court split the case, amid a glimmer of hope that high-level contacts on the sidelines of the World Cup might yield a breakthrough. The dispute over damage to the surface and lightning protection on A350 jetliners grounded by Qatar has led to months of legal manoeuvering between two of aviation's largest players and the unprecedented cancellation of large-scale orders. Judge David Waksman ordered a trial set for next June to be split in two parts because of the sheer weight of disagreements, ensuring the unusually public industry saga rolls on for months. The first part will focus on liability with the combined claims, estimated at around $2 billion, tackled later. Qatar Airways says widespread paint cracking has exposed deeper damage on some A350 jets, prompting it to stop taking deliveries. Qatar's regulator has grounded at least 29 of the jets, citing unanswered safety questions, over the past year. Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab has acknowledged quality problems with its premier long-haul model but denies any risk to safety and has cancelled all outstanding new business with Qatar Airways, which has increased purchases from rival Boeing (BA.N)New Tab . On Friday, the two sides clashed angrily over access to the affected planes with Airbus lawyer David Wolfson complaining with the aid of photographs that its experts had been forced to photograph jets from a distance \"under the light of the moon\". He also accused the airline of engaging in a game of \"switcheroo\" to prevent its experts inspecting in-service jets. Qatar Airways strongly denied failing to cooperate with inspections and said it had given whatever access was practical to jets on short notice as it hosts the World Cup soccer tournament. \"We do have to bear in mind that this is an operating airline,\" the carrier's lawyer Geraint Webb said. The exchange - cut short by an apparently exasperated Waksman - is just one example of the breakdown in co-operation between Airbus and Qatar Airways, once a star customer and the first and largest buyer of Europe's premier long-haul jet. The hearings have focused attention on a disintegrating business relationship at the heart of the $150 billion jet industry, sprinkled with accusations of bad faith on both sides. Both sides have accused the other of colluding with their respective regulators, both of whom have declined to comment. The latest court confrontation comes as France's progression to the World Cup final in Qatar increases high-level contacts that have previously been seen as the opportunity to explore room for agreement. So far there are no signs of a settlement. French President Emmanuel Macron was welcomed at Doha airport on his arrival for Wednesday's semi-final by officials including Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker, Qatar News Agency reported. He will also attend Sunday's final. The welcome by Al Baker in his capacity as minister of tourism is seen as a signal that the dispute is between companies rather than affecting strong diplomatic ties, though some diplomats have said politics may weigh on the outcome. Reuters reported last month that the dispute had risen to the attention of French and Qatari leaders, who discussed the issue last December during a previous visit by Macron to Doha. \"Every time there is contact there is an opportunity to improve the atmosphere,\" one person familiar with the case said, though others warned the two sides remain far apart.",

            "text": "Southwest Airlines (LUV.N)New Tab said on Thursday it was expecting to take fewer deliveries of Boeing's (BA.N)New Tab 737 MAX aircraft and it had left out the MAX 7 model, which is mired in certification delays, from its 2024 fleet plans. The U.S. budget carrier, one of Boeing's loyal customers, expects to take delivery of 79 MAX aircraft this year, compared with its previous estimate of 85, due to the planemaker's supply-chain challenges and the current status of the MAX 7 certification. \"The company's current capacity plans do not assume placing the MAX 7 in service this year and is subject to Boeing's production capability,\" Southwest said in a statement. However, with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) barring Boeing from increasing its MAX production, some airlines could be \"significantly\" impacted by any freeze on higher production, though a shortage of jets could increase carriers' ticket pricing power. Southwest's move to remove the smaller MAX 7 from its fleet plans follows United Airlines' (UAL.O)New Tab announcement earlier this week that it would build a fleet plan without the larger MAX 10, certification of which is also likely to be delayed. Southwest, the largest customer of the MAX 7, told Reuters in November last year it was expecting the plane to be certified by the FAA by April, allowing it to start flying the aircraft in October and November this year. On Thursday, the airline said it had accelerated a small number of MAX 8 orders and converted three 2025 MAX 7 firm orders to three 2024 MAX 8 firm orders. Dallas-based Southwest reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $219 million, or 37 cents per share, nearly unchanged from last year, due to a $426 million operating expense driven by an increase in the ratification bonus for pilots as part of a new contract. Total revenue for the quarter rose 10.5% to $6.82 billion.",

Air Lease (AL.N)New Tab executive chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy said they had \"grossly misjudged\" output, while one of Airbus' largest customers, AerCap (AER.N)New Tab , called the European firm's production targets \"very ambitious\". Mark Pearman-Wright, head of leasing and investor marketing at Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab , said ramping up production had been more difficult than expected but that a range of unpredictable issues had not changed its route to producing 65 narrow-body jets a month in 2024 and 75 aircraft in 2025. \"We've just come out of an unprecedented recession and it's followed by an unprecedented recovery, followed by a war, in addition to a lockdown of China, which has also had an impact on the supply chain,\" Pearman-Wright told the Airline Economics conference in Dublin. \"To keep it simple, c'est compliqué (it's complicated).\" To help remove the bottlenecks, Airbus has placed over 100 procurement specialists into its indirect suppliers to help them achieve the rates in the supply chain that the jetmaker requires to ramp up production, Pearman-Wright added. Boeing has also sent some of its own employees to work with suppliers to help stabilise the supply chain, Vice president for commercial marketing Darren Hulst said, adding this was the key to ultimately ramping up production and hitting its targets. \"Think about mid 2020, nobody in this room wanted an airplane. Nobody. And we had to try to figure out how to not deliver, in addition to our own challenges from our side,\" Hulst said. \"Then all of a sudden the switch turns back on and you're expected to deliver perfectly on time, all the time. I'm not asking for sympathy, but I do think you need to realise that it's not as easy as an on/off switch. \"You add that complexity to the fact that the supply chains in many cases had their own bets on the market which were not accurate, despite the kind of guidance from our side on when we thought the market was going to recover.\"",

            "text": "Boeing (BA.N)New Tab said on Saturday it was in advanced talks to sell a cargo version of its future 777X jetliner jet while Airbus predicted an A350 freighter deal soon, as aerospace giants eye a post-pandemic boom in e-commerce. Boeing also indicated it was nearing the end of production snags on the 787 Dreamliner, but reiterated the timing of any return to normal deliveries depended on talks with regulators. \"We are in pretty advanced discussions with a number of customers. The (777X freighter) looks good from a design standpoint and a requirements standpoint,\" Ihssane Mounir, senior vice president of commercial sales and marketing, said. The U.S. planemaker is poised to launch what it says would be the world's largest and most capable new freighter, while European rival Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab is seeking buyers for an A350 cargo version that it describes as lighter and more efficient. Airbus expects to announce a launch order for the A350 freighter \"soon,\" Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer told a separate news conference on the eve of the Dubai Airshow, the first significant industry gathering since the pandemic. \"I am quite happy with the market response around the world and in the region to the A350 freighter,\" he added. The 777X freighter is expected to be based on the smaller of two versions of the 777X family, known as the 777-8. It had been expected to be launched only after the 777-8 passenger version, but Mounir said it could jump ahead of the 777-8, whose sales have lagged the main 777-9 variant. Boeing is sticking to plans to deliver the 777-9 in 2023, Mounir said. The president of Dubai's Emirates, the biggest customer for the 777X, has sharply criticised Boeing for around three years of delays and a lack of certainty on delivery dates. Qatar Airways has said publicly it is in talks with Boeing over the possible purchase of a 777X freighter, while FedEx (FDX.N)New Tab is widely seen as another early contender. Airbus hopes to land an A350 cargo deal with Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI)New Tab . Freighter traffic has increased as passenger jets that usually carry goods in the hold were grounded by the pandemic. Mounir and Scherer, sales chiefs for the world's two largest planemakers, both said a market recovery was under way, though doubts remain over demand for the largest wide-body jetliners. Boeing is meanwhile approaching the resumption of deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, after suspending them to deal with production flaws, and engaging with Chinese regulators over the re-certification of the 737 MAX in China, Mounir said. But he stressed that Boeing would not pre-empt U.S. or Chinese regulators, who make final decisions on timing. The 787 has been beset by production problems that have halted deliveries since May. In July, the Federal Aviation Administration said some 787s had a manufacturing quality issue. Analysts say Boeing continues to tread a fine line between completing work it says it has itself identified on the 787, a vital alternative source of cash to the still recovering 737 MAX, and leaving the last word on timing to regulators. Boeing said last month it had a \"clear line of sight\" to resuming deliveries but that the Federal Aviation Administration would make the ultimate decision. \"We remain committed to taking the time to ensure each airplane meets our rigorous engineering specifications. We are conducting inspections and rework and engaging in detailed, transparent discussions with our regulators, customers and suppliers,\" Mounir told Reuters in an emailed statement. \"While we never want to disappoint or cause delays for our customers, quality and safety always come first.\" The 737 MAX was cleared by major Western regulators late last year after an almost two-year safety grounding, but China has yet to allow it back to service. China's aviation regulator has told airlines it is satisfied that design changes Boeing proposed for its 737 MAX plane could resolve safety problems, in a sign it is closer to lifting a more than two-year flight ban. read more . Mounir told reporters Boeing would comply with requirements from U.S. or international regulators.",

            "text": "New orders for key U.S.-manufactured capital goods unexpectedly rebounded in April, raising cautious optimism that business spending on equipment could recover in the second quarter after recent back-to-back declines. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, surged 1.4% last month, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Data for March was revised higher to show these so-called core capital goods declining 0.6% instead of 1.1% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders would fall 0.2%. Core capital goods orders increased 2.7% on a year-on-year basis in April. The outlook for business spending on equipment is uncertain. The government reported on Thursday that corporate profits fell in the first quarter, marking the third straight quarterly drop. Higher interest rates are raising costs for businesses, tightening of credit by banks could make it even harder to undertake capital expenditure projects, undercutting manufacturing. The sector, which accounts for 11.3% of the U.S. economy, is also being hampered by a shift in spending away from goods to services and careful management of business inventory levels amid slowing demand. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell 1.0%, while bookings for computers and electronic products dropped 1.4%. Orders for machinery increased 1.0%. Shipments of core capital goods rose 0.5% in April after falling 0.2% in March. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product measurement. Business spending on equipment has declined for two straight quarters, the first back-to-back decline since 2020. Orders for items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more increased 1.1% last month. These so-called durable goods orders climbed 3.3% in March. Transportation orders rose 3.7% after jumping 9.9% in the prior month. Motor vehicle orders dipped 0.1%, falling for a second straight month. The volatile civilian aircraft category experienced an 8.3% drop in orders after a 96.0% surge in March. Boeing (BA.N)New Tab reported on its website that it had received 34 aircraft orders, down from 60 in March.",

Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun acknowledged errors by the U.S. planemaker. \"Across the entire aviation industry, all quality problems must undoubtedly be assessed, with the creation of action plans to mitigate problems and risks,\" said Gol, which is Brazil's second-largest carrier in terms of passengers transported. Gol noted that Boeing itself and other manufacturers have their processes audited by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \"so that problems like these can be solved and avoided in the future.\" The airline operates nearly 40 MAX 8 aircraft and has orders in place for the MAX 10, but it does not operate the MAX 9. The Alaska Airlines accident has put Boeing back under scrutiny as it awaits certification of its smaller MAX 7 as well as the larger MAX 10, which is needed to compete with a key Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab model.

Raising the stakes of a dispute potentially affecting airplane deliveries, which became public, Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker urged the Airbus board to intervene directly. \"(Airbus) need to get real and they need to know that this problem will create industrial repercussions for them,\" Al Baker told Reuters in an interview. \"The ball is in their court to fix the problem we have with them, and it is up to them to resolve this as soon as possible before things can get a bit out of hand,\" Al Baker added. He declined to give specifics, but denied a Reuters report that the dispute concerned A350 paintwork. read more \"I think now is a time for the Airbus board to get involved and look at what is going on,\" Al Baker said. An Airbus spokesman said the planemaker regularly held talks with its customers and that these remained confidential. Al Baker was speaking on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, chaired by President Vladimir Putin, where a large Qatari delegation is present this year. The Gulf airline official is among the most influential and outspoken in the aviation industry and has periodically lashed out at Airbus or Boeing (BA.N)New Tab for delays or quality lapses. The airline says its exacting standards reflect its premium brand, though aerospace executives have accused it of seizing on such details in the past to delay taking deliveries or gain leverage in other negotiations, a suggestion it has denied. Earlier this week, industry sources told Reuters Qatar Airways and Airbus had clashed over A350 paintwork. A separate source later said Qatar Airways had complained that paint was peeling off the carbon-fibre A350, Airbus' state-of-the-art wide-body jet of which Qatar is the biggest customer. Another cited the technical quality of fresh livery painted on to existing Qatar Airways A350s ahead of the 2022 World Cup. \"This is not a paint issue,\" Al Baker said on Thursday. As of the end of April, Qatar Airways had 73 planes on order from Airbus that had yet to be delivered, including 23 A350s. On Monday, Al Baker was quoted by Bloomberg as saying Qatar Airways would refuse to take new aircraft from Airbus unless the dispute was resolved.",

German consumer prices, harmonised to compare with other European Union countries, rose by 4.3% on the year in September, preliminary data from the federal statistics office showed on Thursday.

            "text": "Boeing (BA.N)New Tab has embarked on a high-risk waiting game over the next round of jet developments, betting nascent technology will restore it to glory in the 2030s while ceding the upper hand in a key part of the market to Airbus for the rest of this decade. Chief Executive Dave Calhoun on Wednesday buried the prospect of an early bid to rebuild Boeing's battered position at the top of the single-aisle market with a new jet, pledging to focus on cash as it recovers from safety and other crises. The move marks a victory for engine-maker CFM which had publicly trailed a radical design offering 20%-plus fuel savings but not before 2035 - effectively nudging its biggest customer away from acting any sooner with a more conventional plane. Industry sources said lifting the spectre of a new jet also cheered Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab which - like CFM - has most to gain from milking a favourable status quo and avoiding a premature product race. Between them, billions of dollars in potential R&D savings are at stake. CFM, co-owned by General Electric (GE.N)New Tab and Safran (SAF.PA)New Tab , powers Boeing 737 MAXs and about half the Airbus A320/321neo family, which has a strong market lead. That doesn't bother Calhoun who played down runaway sales of the A321neo. \"I don't want to fill a gap in a product line. I want to build a product that's going to differentiate in a way that absolutely substitutes the airplanes that came before it,\" Calhoun told analysts at an investor day. Such a plane would be 20-30% more efficient and start to lay the groundwork for future autonomous or machine-driven flight. \"There'll be a moment in time where we'll pull the rabbit out of the hat and introduce a new airplane sometime in the middle of the next decade,\" he said. Analysts said that was meant to reassure investors Boeing would not embark on a $15-billion spree before reducing its $45 billion of net debt, while reassuring restless airlines any 737 successor would be worth the wait. That marks what some industry sources described as a quiet but decisive U-turn behind the scenes after months in which the planemaker had been informally touting the possibility of a pair of late 2020s jets known as 5X and 6X to block the A321neo. It now calculates the MAX family of aircraft will carry it through the decade, as originally planned, in the face of still-evolving technology and limited resources. Investors mostly agreed, pushing up Boeing's shares some 10%. But industry insiders said there were a number of risks in Calhoun's strategy of waiting out the 2020s. First, Boeing is now more than ever dependent on getting its MAX 10 - needed to counter the A321neo - certified. That depends on a Congressional waiver which although far from automatic is ultimately likely to happen, congressional aides say. If it fails, the 5X/6X may yet see the light of day. Second, it leaves Airbus with an entrenched market lead through the decade, rather than the 50/50 split seen over time. That offers Airbus a cost advantage as well as a useful negotiating currency with which to convert existing customers to its own next jet likely to appear in the 2030s. Calhoun stressed market share was not the issue. But industry experts said it appeared no accident that Boeing's mid-decade delivery forecasts - 50 single-aisles a month compared with Airbus' goal of 75 - gave Boeing an implied share of 40%, widely seen as the lowest needed for a duopoly to remain stable. \"They are settling for 40% but no less,\" a senior industry source said. Neither planemaker was immediately available for comment. Sitting out the decade also leaves the MAX family exposed to competition from a potential new variant of Airbus' smaller but lighter A220. Airbus has said the A220-500 is \"when not if\". Amid the threat to its MAX cash cow from below, Boeing highlighted plans to put pressure on Airbus from above and generate more cash by pledging higher 787 wide-body output. Harder to measure are the intangible risks of waiting. Ron Epstein of Bank of America said lack of investment historically turns market dominance to \"market subordination\". Calhoun insists patience will pay off next decade. Until then, the numbers of a lop-sided duopoly favour Airbus barring a setback in its own output plans, which many see as ambitious. \"If we bring any of the capabilities that I am suggesting will be available to us at that moment...leadership will be well within our grasp,\" Calhoun said.",

            "text": "Ground teams at Kennedy Space Center prepared on Tuesday for a third try at launching NASA's towering, next-generation moon rocket, the debut flight of the U.S. space agency's Artemis lunar program, 50 years after Apollo's last moon mission. The 32-story tall Space Launch System (SLS) rocket was due to blast off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 1:04 a.m. EST (0604 GMT) on Wednesday to send its Orion capsule on a 25-day voyage around the moon and back without astronauts aboard. NASA flight-readiness crews were eager for success after 10 weeks beset by engineering difficulties, two hurricanes and two trips from the spacecraft's hangar to its launch pad. Two previous launch attempts, on Aug. 29 and Sept. 3, were aborted because of fuel line leaks and other technical problems that NASA has since resolved. While moored to its launch pad last week, the rocket endured fierce winds and rains from Hurricane Nicole, forcing a two-day flight postponement. Post-storm inspections found the hurricane had torn off a strip of ultra-thin protective sealant from Orion's exterior, but NASA officials said Monday night the damage was minor and posed negligible risk to the launch. Weather is always a factor beyond NASA's control. The latest forecast on Monday called for a 90% chance of favorable conditions during Wednesday's two-hour launch window, according to the U.S. Space Force at Cape Canaveral. Dubbed Artemis I, the mission marks the first flight of the SLS rocket and the Orion capsule together, built under NASA contracts with Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N)New Tab , respectively. It also signals a major change in direction for NASA's post-Apollo human spaceflight program, after decades focused on low-Earth orbit with space shuttles and the International Space Station. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/3PPRsbNNew Tab ) SUCCESSOR TO APOLLO Named for the Greek goddess of the hunt - and Apollo's twin sister - Artemis aims to return astronauts to the moon's surface as early as 2025. Twelve astronauts walked on the moon during six Apollo missions from 1969 to 1972, the only spaceflights yet to place humans on the lunar surface. But Apollo, born of the U.S.-Soviet space race during the Cold War, was less science-driven than Artemis. The new moon program has enlisted commercial partners such as Elon Musk's SpaceX and the space agencies of Europe, Canada and Japan to eventually establish a long-term lunar base as a stepping stone to even more ambitious human voyages to Mars. Getting the SLS-Orion spacecraft off the ground is a key first step. Its first voyage is intended to put the 5.75-million-pound vehicle through its paces in a rigorous test flight, pushing its design limits to prove the spacecraft is suitable to fly astronauts. If the mission succeeds, a crewed Artemis II flight around the moon and back could come as early as 2024, followed within a few more years by the program's first lunar landing of astronauts, one of them a woman, with Artemis III. Billed as the most powerful, complex rocket in the world, the SLS represents the biggest new vertical launch system the U.S. space agency has built since the Saturn V of the Apollo era. Barring last-minute difficulties, the launch countdown should end with the rocket's four main R-25 engines and its twin solid-rocket boosters igniting to produce 8.8 million pounds of thrust, sending the spacecraft streaking skyward. About 90 minutes after liftoff, the rocket's upper stage will propel Orion out of Earth orbit on course for a 25-day flight that brings it to within 60 miles of the lunar surface before sailing 40,000 miles (64,374 km) beyond the moon and back to Earth. The capsule is expected to splash down in the Pacific on Dec. 11. Although no humans will be aboard, Orion will carry a simulated crew of three - one male and two female mannequins - fitted with sensors to measure radiation levels and other stresses that real-life astronauts would experience. A top objective for the mission is to test the durability of Orion's heat shield during re-entry as it hits Earth's atmosphere at 24,500 miles (39,429 km) per hour, or 32 times the speed of sound, on its return from lunar orbit - much faster than re-entries of capsules returning from the space station. The heat shield is designed to withstand re-entry friction expected to raise temperatures outside the capsule to nearly 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,760 Celsius). More than a decade in development with years of delays and budget overruns, the SLS-Orion spacecraft has so far cost NASA least $37 billion, including design, construction, testing and ground facilities. NASA's Office of Inspector General has projected total Artemis costs will run to $93 billion by 2025. NASA defends the program as a boon to space exploration that has generated tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in commerce.",

            "text": "A group of U.S. lawmakers want the Federal Aviation Administration to answer key questions about its oversight of Boeing (BA.N)New Tab in the wake of a 737 MAX 9 mid-air emergency, including whether it found serious quality issues at the planemaker. In the letter sent on Wednesday, the legislators also asked whether the FAA was contemplating changes to the way it oversaw the manufacturing processes of Boeing and its suppliers. Reuters was the first to reveal the letter. The FAA, acting after a mid-air cabin panel blowout on a new Alaska Airlines MAX 9 (ALK.N)New Tab , says it will audit all elements of production at Boeing and fuselage production at Spirit AeroSystems. In the letter, the legislators asked FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker to answer whether - before or after the accident - the agency found \"any evidence of persistent quality control lapses in any of Boeing's production lines\". It was signed by House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chair Sam Graves and Rick Larsen, the top Democrat on the committee, along with Representative Garret Graves, the chair of the aviation subcommittee and Democrat Steve Cohen. Whitaker is set to testify Tuesday before the aviation subcommittee. An FAA spokesperson said the agency would respond to the letter. \"Is the FAA considering any changes to its broader on-site surveillance of Boeing's and its suppliers' manufacturing processes to help ensure its products conform to their type design?\" the letter said. \"What changes, if any, is the FAA considering to its current risk model for inspecting production facilities?\" The FAA has scrutinized Boeing's quality and other issues in recent years as it faced harsh criticism for its actions in the run-up to the MAX certification. Following two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, the FAA grounded the plane for 20 months and mandated significant software and training improvements. The FAA says a team of two dozen aviation safety inspectors will conduct the new audit at the Boeing 737 facility in Renton, Washington, and at Spirit in Wichita, Kansas. The audit will also examine how Boeing transfers unfinished work from suppliers to its production lines. The letter also asked whether the FAA was considering further action on Safety Management Systems (SMS) requirements \"for aircraft part suppliers or other entities involved in aircraft manufacturing not captured by current regulations.\" The SMS are a set of policies and procedures to proactively identify and address potential operational hazards early on. In March last year, the FAA told Congress it was ramping up oversight of Boeing following two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019. The FAA grounded 171 MAX 9 jets on Jan. 6, resulting in thousands of flight cancellations by Alaska Airlines and United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab . The grounding was lifted on Jan. 24. The letter also asked whether airlines were able to receive the information they needed to ensure they could plan ahead and minimize potential operating disruptions.",

Howard McKenzie, the top engineer at Boeing's commercial planes unit, immediately replaces Greg Hyslop, who assumed the role of chief engineer in 2019 and will retire in June, the company said. David Loffing, the 777X chief program engineer, takes over as vice president and chief engineer of Boeing's commercial airplanes unit, the company added. McKenzie, who has spent 35 years at the company, steps into Boeing's top engineering position at a time when no new commercial airplane programs are under development. Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun has said the company may not design a new jetliner for at least a decade as it recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and two 737 MAX crashes that led to that aircraft's grounding, which was lifted in 2020. As the top engineer, McKenzie will oversee safety and manage Boeing's technology investment and strategy, reporting directly to Calhoun. During his tenure, Hyslop championed digital engineering, a process where virtual versions of a new aircraft and the production line itself are documented in extreme detail and can be easily modified, allowing the company to use simulations to identify design flaws or other potential problems. Calhoun said Hyslop played an \"instrumental role in strengthening our engineering organization,\" positioning the company to adopt new digital, autonomy and sustainable technologies. In the months before his retirement, Hyslop will provide program management expertise as an advisor to Calhoun, Boeing said.",

            "text": "Britain's Rolls-Royce (RR.L)New Tab said on Tuesday it was taking steps to improve the durability of its Trent XWB-97 jet engines but denied a suggestion from one of the industry's most influential leaders that the Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab A350-1000 engine was defective. Chief Customer Officer Ewen McDonald acknowledged that the company's largest engine faced challenges in climates like Dubai, where Emirates has held off ordering the A350-1000. \"The engine works really well in what we call benign operations ... But in sandy, hot conditions it is challenged, as all modern engines are, because the temperatures are very high. We see it across the industry,\" he said in an interview. Emirates president Tim Clark earlier voiced concerns about the durability of the Trent 97-XWB and Rolls-Royce maintenance prices, a day after placing a major order for 90 Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 777X with rival engines from GE Aerospace (GE.N)New Tab . Clark told reporters the engine of the aircraft was able to spend only a quarter of the time \"on wing\" between service visits, compared to expected levels, and said this amounted to a level of performance that he described as \"defective\". While the engine maker generally picks up any direct excess maintenance costs as a result of increased shop visits under long-term service deals, the increased downtime is disruptive and costly for airlines. The ability of some engines to cope with the most demanding environments without extra maintenance is one of the industry's most keenly debated issues, with U.S. supplier Pratt & Whitney (RTX.N)New Tab in the firing line over this and other industrial snags.",

            "text": "With a dash of launch-pad heroics and 8.8 million pounds (4 million kg) of thrust, NASA's colossal new rocket soared into space for the first time early on Wednesday, sending a next-generation capsule on a crewless voyage around the moon and back 50 years after the final Apollo lunar mission. The U.S. space agency's much-delayed and highly anticipated launch from Florida kicked off Apollo's successor program, Artemis, aimed at returning astronauts to the lunar surface this decade and establishing a sustainable base there as a stepping stone to future human exploration of Mars. The 32-story-tall Space Launch System (SLS) rocket blasted off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center at 1:47 a.m. EST (0647 GMT), piercing the blackness over Cape Canaveral with a reddish-orange tail of fire as crowds of spectators cheered and screamed. About 90 minutes later, the rocket's upper stage propelled the Orion capsule out of Earth orbit and on its trajectory to the moon, NASA said. The three-week Artemis I mission entails a 25-day Orion flight bringing the capsule to within about 60 miles (97 km) of the lunar surface before flying about 40,000 miles (64,400 km) beyond the moon and looping back to Earth. The capsule is expected to splash down at sea on Dec. 11. \"Today, we got to witness the world's most powerful rocket take the Earth by its edges and shake the wicked out of it. And it was quite a sight,\" Artemis mission manager Mike Sarafin told a post-launch NASA briefing, using words from biblical scripture. Aside from some minor instrument issues, \"this system is performing exactly as we intended it to,\" Sarafin said. Liftoff came on the third try at launching the multibillion-dollar rocket - Aug. 29 and Sept. 3 attempts were aborted - after 10 weeks beset by technical mishaps, back-to-back hurricanes and two excursions trundling the spacecraft out of its hangar to the launch pad. Wednesday's launch was not without its own drama. About four hours before blastoff, crews had to deal with a flurry of issues including a leaky fuel valve. Quick work by a special \"red team\" of technicians, who tightened down a loose connection on the launch pad well inside the \"blast zone\" demarcated around a nearly fully fueled rocket, was credited with saving the launch. The mission marks the first flight of the combined SLS rocket and the Orion capsule together, built by Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N)New Tab , respectively, under contract with NASA. It signals an ambitious change in direction for NASA's post-Apollo human spaceflight program after decades focused on low-Earth orbit with space shuttles and the International Space Station. (See graphicNew Tab ) Named for the ancient Greek goddess of the hunt - and Apollo's twin sister - Artemis aims to return astronauts to the moon's surface as early as 2025. To date, only 12 people have ever walked on the moon, all of them NASA astronauts, during six Apollo missions running from 1969 to 1972 - a Cold War-era feat born of the U.S.-Soviet space race. More science-driven than Apollo, the Artemis program has far greater horizons and has enlisted commercial partners such as Elon Musk's SpaceX and the space agencies of Europe, Canada and Japan. Although no people were aboard, Orion carried a simulated crew of three mannequins fitted with sensors to measure radiation levels and other stresses that astronauts would experience. The thunder of the thrust produced by the rocket's four main R-25 engines and its twin solid-rocket boosters shook the Kennedy complex. \"It was just incredible to see. It was so bright, so loud, you could feel it,\" said NASA astronaut Jessica Meir, an Artemis crew candidate. Orion will have some company around the moon. A tiny satellite, CAPSTONE, reached lunar orbit on Sunday to try out a complex gravitational parking position that may be suitable for a future lunar space station called Gateway, under development for the Artemis program. Artemis I is intended primarily to put the SLS-Orion vehicle through its paces, pushing its design limits to prove its safety and reliability to fly astronauts. If the mission succeeds, a crewed Artemis II flight around the moon and back could come as early as 2024, followed within a few years by the program's first lunar landing of astronauts, one of them a woman, with Artemis III. Sending astronauts to Mars is expected to take at least another decade and a half to achieve. The SLS represents the biggest new vertical launch system NASA has built since the Apollo era's Saturn V. A top objective is to test the durability of Orion's heat shield as it re-enters Earth's atmosphere at 24,500 miles (39,400 km) per hour - much faster than re-entries from the space station. The spacecraft also is set to release 10 miniaturized science satellites including one designed to map ice deposits on the moon's south pole, where Artemis seeks to eventually land astronauts. More than a decade in development with years of delays and budget overruns, the SLS-Orion spacecraft has cost NASA least $37 billion, with total Artemis spending projected to reach $93 billion by 2025. NASA has said the program has generated tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in commerce.",

            "text": "Two high-tech Airbus A350 jets sit idle with their windows taped and engines covered in a floodlit hangar in the Gulf, hobbled by an international legal dispute between European industrial giant Airbus and Qatar's national carrier. From a distance, the planes might seem like any other long-haul jetliners crowding the busy Doha hub. But a rare on-site visit by Reuters journalists showed what appeared to be evidence of damage to the surface of parts of the wings, tail and hull. The two planes, worth around $300 million combined according to analysts, are among 23 grounded A350s at the centre of a $1 billion London court battle over whether the damage represents a potential safety risk, something Airbus strongly denies. The planes were grounded by Qatar's regulator after premature paint erosion exposed damage to a metallic sub-layer that provides protection to the fuselage from lightning strikes. Other airlines continue to fly the A350 after European regulators declared it safe, with several carriers recently acknowledging surface issues while calling them \"cosmetic\". Reuters journalists were granted rare first-hand access after requesting the visit on the sidelines of an airline industry meeting in the Qatari capital, Doha, this week. Sporadic surface flaws on the A350s viewed by Reuters included an elongated stretch of blistered and cracked or missing paint along the roof or crown of the jets. In some areas including on the curved wingtips, the protective lightning mesh that sits between the hull and the paint appeared exposed and corroded. In other parts it appeared to be missing, leaving areas of the composite hull exposed. The paint on the tail of one of the A350s emblazoned with Qatar Airways' maroon Arabian Oryx emblem was pockmarked by cracked and missing paint that exposed the dull carbon beneath. Reuters saw small areas of what appeared to be fraying or delaminated carbon threads on the hull and so-called 'rivet rash' or lost paint from fastener heads on the main wing areas. Airbus and Qatar Airways had no immediate comment on Reuters' findings. Shares in Airbus fell 2.4% on Wednesday amid weaker aerospace stocks. EROSION Airbus acknowledges quality flaws on the A350s, but denies they pose any safety risk because of the number of backup systems and tolerance built into the design. Qatar Airways has argued this can't be known until further analysis, and is refusing to take more of the planes. Airbus has argued that some paint erosion is a feature of the carbon-composite technology used to build all modern long-haul jets - a necessary trade-off for weight savings. It says the cracks are caused by the way paint, anti-lightning material called ECF and the composite structure interact. The tail does not all contain the ECF foil, prompting a debate over whether damage there comes from the same problem. Qatar Airways has questioned Airbus' explanation, telling a UK court its similar Boeing 787s do not have the same problems. A Reuters investigation last November revealed at least five other airlines had reported surface issues as far back as 2016, after the A350 entered service the previous year. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which oversees the design of the jet, said the degradation seen in the surface protection \"does not constitute an unsafe condition\". \"EASA’s sole interest in this matter is aviation safety,\" a spokesperson said. Qatar's own aviation regulator has declined to comment since the dispute began. Amid hundreds of pages of conflicting technical court filings presented by both sides, Reuters has not been able to verify independently the cause of the damage. Qatar Airways' Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker and Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury had the opportunity to mingle during the three-day industry gathering in Qatar this week. Asked whether the relationship had improved after the event, which included the two men seated next to each other over dinner, Al Baker suggested the two sides remain far apart. \"On a personal level I am friends with everyone but when it comes to an issue with my company, then it's a different story. If things were settled, we would not be still waiting for a trial to happen next year,\" he told a news conference. Faury said this week he was in discussion with the airline and reported \"progress in the sense that we are communicating\". One of the airline industry's most senior officials voiced concerns after the Doha meeting that the dispute could have a toxic effect on contractual ties across the industry. \"It would be much better if we were dealing with friends that than dealing in the courts,\" Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association, told reporters.",

Senior, a supplier to Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab , expects higher production of single-aisle or narrow-body jets this year as a recovery in air travel for long-haul routes, which use wide-body jets, takes longer than expected. The British engineering firm, which sources some titanium from Russia, said it did not expect any major impact on supply from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has prompted Western nations to impose severe sanctions on Russia. \"We've got all our supply lines secured for this year, so its not a major concern in terms of customers and suppliers,\" Chief Executive David Squires said in an interview. \"But obviously, the broader consequences, we'll need to see what happens there.\" Senior bought about 500,000 pounds ($668,200) worth of titanium from Russia last year, Squires said, adding the country accounted for only 0.3% of 2021 sales. Senior supplies cabin air circulation systems for Irkut's (IRKT.MM)New Tab MC-21 narrow-body jet. Irkut's parent firm United Aircraft Corporation is majority owned by Rostec, Russia's state aerospace and defence conglomerate. The conflict in Ukraine and Western sanctions on Russia were unlikely to impact demand for the Airbus A320 and the Boeing's 737 MAX, Squires said. The London-listed company reported an adjusted pretax loss of 1.9 million pounds ($2.5 million) for the year ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of 6.2 million pounds a year ago, largely as it reined in costs.

Ted Colbert did not give details of learnings, but said they had contributed to a new schedule for the two planes that has seen deliveries pushed back to 2026 and 2027. \"The lessons learned are important to us and we're applying them going forward,\" Colbert told reporters at a briefing ahead of the Farnborough air show. \"We've made changes to the program. We've made changes to the way we work on the program.\" \"These are challenging programs and you learn as you go along and you adapt as you have to,\" he added. In April, Boeing recorded a $660 million charge after taking a $318-million one in April 2021 on the program \"largely due to COVID-19 impacts and performance issues at a key supplier.\" Asked if Boeing could recoup those cost overruns, Colbert said: \"If we can find a way to we will.\" Boeing received a $3.9 billion contract in 2018 for two 747-8 aircraft to be delivered starting in 2024. In December 2016, then U.S. President-elect Donald Trump secured a promise from then Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg that the cost of replacing Air Force One would not exceed $4 billion. Trump had earlier urged the government to cancel buying Boeing's new Air Force One, saying it was \"ridiculous\" and too expensive. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said in April the deal was problematic. \"Air Force One - I'm just going to call a very unique moment, a very unique negotiation, a very unique set of risks that Boeing probably shouldn't have taken,\" Calhoun said. \"But we are where we are, and we're going to deliver great airplanes.

            "text": "Shortages of new planes, jet engines and pilots have left U.S. airlines with little choice but to pursue growth through acquisitions - which then puts them in the crosshairs of anti-trust regulators. Alaska Airlines (ALK.N)New Tab surprised analysts and industry officials with its plan to buy Hawaiian Airlines (HA.O)New Tab for $1.9 billion even before a judge rules on the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) lawsuit aimed at blocking JetBlue's (JBLU.O)New Tab proposed merger with Spirit Airlines (SAVE.N)New Tab . But supply and labor constraints are so onerous that airlines like Alaska will likely keep chasing deals despite the Biden administration's aversion to more consolidation. Currently, American Airlines (AAL.O)New Tab , United, Delta and Southwest Airlines (LUV.N)New Tab control 80% of the domestic market, leaving little room for growth. \"This is an industry that is constantly looking for an angle,\" said Addison Schonland, partner at consulting firm AirInsight. \"If Alaska didn't move on Hawaiian, what would stop somebody else moving on Hawaiian?\" The deal will provide Alaska - primarily a domestic carrier that flies narrowbody planes - Hawaiian's widebody jets, pilots and international networks, opening a runway for growth in long-haul international markets. In an interview, Alaska CEO Ben Minicucci said it was the right time to do the deal, which he described as \"a great investment, a great step change\" for the company. Alaska told analysts on Sunday that pursuing long-haul international flying on its own would be much more expensive and much more difficult. Courtney Miller, a consultant who advocated for the merger between the two airlines back in 2019, said Alaska would probably have to invest around the same amount it is paying for Hawaiian to launch its own smaller international operation. Getting into long-haul international flying by using Hawaiian's fleet of wide-body jets and international networks is a better option, he said. With both Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab facing supply-chain problems, the deal allows Alaska to avoid a prolonged wait for new planes. It also reduces the need to hire and train pilots during an industry-wide staffing crunch and saves the company from fighting for slots at international airports. \"The risk is much lower,\" said Miller, who now runs consultancy firm Visual Approach Analytics. Mergers and acquisitions create economies of scale that helps offset soaring operating costs. Alaska, however, will be challenged on this front as it integrates Hawaiian's fleet, said Schonland. While the Seattle-based airline flies Boeing's 737 planes, Hawaiian's fleet has a number of Airbus jets, so a combined company would have to rely on different parts and mechanics for repairs. Minicucci said while the combined company will continue to operate a mixed fleet for now, he did not rule out reviewing the plane mix. Legacy airlines like Delta (DAL.N)New Tab and United (UAL.O)New Tab have been able to mitigate inflationary pressures due to strong bookings for flights to Europe and Asia. But softening domestic travel demand has hurt earnings of domestic carriers including Alaska. Similar growth concerns prompted JetBlue to launch a hostile bid for Spirit last year to try to expand JetBlue's domestic footprint and help it capitalize on the surge in leisure travel between the U.S. East Coast and the Caribbean. The deals, however, face challenges in convincing anti-trust regulators that they are pro-competition and pro-consumer. Former Federal Trade Commission Chairman William Kovacic, who now teaches at George Washington University law school, said the DOJ is likely to look at Alaska's transaction carefully. \"They approach airlines with a view that merger policy has been too permissive and allowed excessive concentration,\" he said.",

(Danilo Masoni) ***** NO TIME TO WAVER, CHAIR POWELL (0805 GMT) Some previous market tantrums over a looming tightening in policy made central bankers think twice about taking away hefty monetary support. Yet, for the Federal Reserve, concluding a two-day meeting later on Wednesday, things are now different. With inflation raging at 40-year highs, the Fed is unlikely to backtrackNew Tab on its intent to raise interest rates and will almost certainly flag a March rate hike later on Wednesday. Yet, the almost 9% slide in the S&P 500 this month and the flattening of the U.S. yield curve are not good indicators of sentiment towards the economic outlook, and may temper the case for more hawkish stance from the Fed. The fine line between taking action to contain inflation but not tightening policy too fast that it brings the recovery to a quick end, is exactly the line Fed chief Jerome Powell has to walk. Markets will be watching his every step. Meanwhile, odds are split on whether or not the Bank of Canada will hike ratesNew Tab for the first time since 2018 when it meets later in the day. The bank may need to take Omicron's wrath into account while deciding whether to start a tightening campaign geared at taming red-hot inflation.

            "text": "Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab has started developing fuel-cell engine technology, it said on Wednesday as it reaffirmed plans to introduce a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft by 2035. The system is one of several options being considered for a potential zero-emission aircraft based on hydrogen, an effective and clean carrier of energy, Airbus said. It is the first time the world's largest planemaker has branched out into developing engine-related technology, but zero-emission project head Glenn Llewellyn said it would not necessarily go it alone if the system ended up being deployed. Hydrogen flight is one of several potential developments being explored as aviation faces a daunting task of reaching net-zero emission targets by 2050, though there are big transatlantic differences over the path to curbing emissions. Jet engine makers Rolls-Royce (RR.L)New Tab , General Electric (GE.N)New Tab , Safran (SAF.PA)New Tab and Pratt & Whitney (RTX.N)New Tab are among its biggest suppliers. Although Airbus once briefly considered buying Britain's Rolls-Royce over a decade ago, planemakers have historically shied away from competing with engine makers whose powerplants fly on multiple platforms to recoup huge development costs. But the increasingly integrated nature of possible future plane designs, which may involve different configurations than in the past, has increased the opportunity for overlap. Experts said Airbus was likely to partner with an engine maker if the project comes to fruition, with Airbus focusing on the fuel cell and the engine industry focusing on their core activity of managing power for flight. Airbus has already partnered with GE/Safran joint-venture CFM International to test an engine fuelled directly by hydrogen. Hydrogen can be combusted in an engine directly like other fuels, but without creating carbon emissions, or used to create electricity via a fuel cell to drive an electric engine. The need for large and heavy tanks for the hydrogen fuel and new global infrastructure are among the hurdles. Airbus said it was looking at both concepts as well as joining forces with carmaker Renault (RENA.PA)New Tab to study hybrid-electric technology that is also of interest for aviation. Rival Boeing (BA.N)New Tab has voiced scepticism about the commercial feasibility of hydrogen in aviation. But Airbus said it was pushing ahead with its goal, which has drawn political support in Europe, including some green funding. \"All of us are dead-set on making zero-emission aircraft a reality,\" Llewellyn told the Airbus Summit, a two-day event designed to showcase the company's sustainability activities. Environmental groups say the aviation industry is not doing enough and ignoring a need to fly less to fight climate change. Airbus made a series of announcements including a preliminary agreement with Finnish biofuel producer Neste (NESTE.HE)New Tab to promote use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which most experts say represents the most promising path to curbing emissions in the near term. They gave no financial details. Airbus is aiming for a 100-seater \"zero-E\" plane, sitting below its current portfolio starting at 110 seats, and has said it is looking at various shapes and designs for propulsion. But it ruled out pressing ahead with a distinctive blended-wing-body shape which has featured in earlier presentations alongside a conventional \"tube and wing\" shape or a turboprop. Airbus will start ground and flight testing fuel-cell architecture towards the middle of the decade.",

            "text": "China held a ceremony on Thursday to certify its C919 narrowbody passenger jet, photos on social media showed, representing a major milestone in the country's ambitions to challenge Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab in commercial aerospace. The plane, produced by state-owned manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), had been widely expected to be certified by the end of the month after two aircraft flew to Beijing on Sept. 13. A sign in one of the photos said \"C919 aircraft type certificate issuance ceremony\" in Chinese. COMAC did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The C919, launched 14 years ago and designed to carry up to 168 passengers, will compete against the popular Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX families in the world's second-biggest aviation market as China looks to boost its technological self-reliance amid trade tensions. Although the plane is assembled in China, it relies heavily on Western componentsNew Tab , including engines and avionics, from companies including GE (GE.N)New Tab , Safran (SAF.PA)New Tab and Honeywell International (HON.O)New Tab . Tough U.S. export licensing rules have led to delays in sourcing parts and remain a key risk to ramped up production until China replaces foreign engines and components with homegrown technology. Richard Aboulafia, U.S.-based managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, said the plane seems like a relic of a bygone era of increasing integration between China and the West. \"Thus, we have an aircraft that is only superficially Chinese but is actually powered by Western technologies and systems,\" he said. \"Turning it into a genuine Chinese aircraft would take well over a decade and many billions of dollars.\" The type of certificate granted on Thursday means it can be delivered to the first customer, China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd (600115.SS)New Tab , though local media have reported the plane is unlikely to enter commercial service with passengers until next year. The C919 has never made an appearance at the country's premier aviation event, Airshow China and it is unclear whether it will be on display or flown at the show in November. COMAC will also need a separate production certificate before it can ramp up mass production of the plane, meaning its impact on the global aircraft market could remain limited given Airbus and Boeing produce dozens of narrowbodies a month. \"The C919 will gradually begin to replace single-aisle aircraft made by Boeing and Airbus,\" in China, a research note by Huaxi Securities said this month. \"In the next 20 years, China's demand for narrowbody passenger aircraft like the C919 will be on average 300 per year.\" The C919's regional jet predecessor, the ARJ21, faced a 2.5-year gap between obtaining the type certificate and the production certificate, slowing production. That contrasts with the West, where both certificates are typically granted around the same time. Like the ARJ21, the C919 lacks certification validation by U.S. and European regulators, limiting flights to the domestic market and possibly countries with close ties to China. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has been working for years on a certification validation process on the C919 with COMAC in parallel to CAAC's work, an EASA spokesperson said. \"We cannot comment on the date when this validation would be completed,\" the spokesperson said. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration did not respond to a request for comment on a potential C919 certification validation. There have been 815 orders for the C919 from 28 customers, according to COMAC's website. But China Eastern is the only customer that has announced a firm delivery schedule and it expects to receive only four next year. In the meantime, the Boeing 737 MAX has yet to return to commercial service in China, having been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes. However, three months ago major Chinese airlines placed an order for nearly 300 Airbus A320neo family planes, showing the country plans to continue imports for some time. Aboulafia said if China did decide to halt Western aircraft imports, the United States and allied countries could kill the C919 for years by prohibiting component exports. \"Try building an aircraft without an engine, or avionics,\" he said. \"It would just be a metal shell.\"",

I want them to be perfect, I want the FAA to feel comfortable, and then give them the time to go review.\" Boeing shares rose on the news, closing up 1.5%. Last week, Chief Financial Officer Brian West reiterated Boeing's expectation that the MAX 7 will complete certification this year, paving the way for first delivery this year as well. Boeing continues to grapple with supply chain headaches as it pushes to ramp up production of the bestselling MAX narrowbody jet as well as its widebody 787 Dreamliner. On Thursday, Deal said the situation is \"getting better\" but that aerospace companies are still working to train fresh hires to handle the influx of post-pandemic aircraft orders. Boeing plans to increase monthly MAX production to 50 planes per month by the end of 2026, while ramping 787 production to 10 aircraft per month during the same period. In the near term, the company also intends to extend 787 Dreamliner production from its current low rate of less than three jets to five jets per month by the end of 2023. Deal declined to comment on when Boeing would ramp up to its previous rate of three 787s per month, but said a recent 787 delivery delay to American Airlines is not indicative of a production slowdown. “We’ve got a couple of suppliers we’re working with,” Deal said, declining to name which companies are receiving assistance from Boeing. “We’re making sure our factory is stable, but you will see that [rate] turn up this year.”",

They impact Americans confidence in our aviation system,\" said Senate Commerce chair Maria Cantwell at Wednesday's hearing. \"The FAA must have redundancies, and not a single point where a failure can happen in a key system.\" The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating a series of serious close calls including a near collision last month between FedEx (FDX.N)New Tab and Southwest Airlines (LUV.N)New Tab planes in Austin and a runway incursion at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. Acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen said the agency was taking steps to prevent near misses and speed up systems modernization efforts but acknowledged some upgrades will take years to complete. Senator Ted Cruz, the top Republican on the committee, said the near misses \"were almost mass fatality crashes\" that could have killed hundreds of people. In addition to the close calls, senators wanted answers about a January situation in which the FAA halted all departing passenger airline flights for nearly two hours because of a computer outage in a pilot messaging database, the first nationwide ground stop of its kind since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Cruz asked if new FAA safeguards remove the risk of a similar single point of failure. \"Is there redundancy built into it, or can a single screwup ground air traffic nationwide?\" On Tuesday, Nolen said he was launching a safety review after the recent near miss incidents raised questions about the U.S. aviation system. The FAA will hold a safety summit in March. The NTSB on Tuesday said it would investigate a Dec. 18 incident in which United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 777 jet lost significant altitude before recovering shortly after departing Kahului, Hawaii.

The U.S. requires cockpit voice recorders to log two hours of data versus 25 hours in Europe for planes made after 2021. The industry has been wrestling with the length of cockpit recordings since the disappearance of a Malaysian jet in 2014. Although the Boeing 777 has never been found, the loss of MH370 sharply increased efforts to monitor the longest possible modern flights and where necessary recap earlier flights. In 2016, members of the United Nations' aviation agency, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), recommended a 25-hour recording on planes manufactured from 2021, in line with the period of time already used for keeping flight data. \"There was a lot going on, on the flight deck and on the plane. It's a very chaotic event. The circuit breaker for the CVR (cockpit voice recorder) was not pulled. The maintenance team went out to get it, but it was right at about the two-hour mark,\" Homendy said. The plane's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were sent to NTSB labs on Sunday to be read but no voice data was available, she said. The NTSB has been vocal in calling for the U.S. to extend its rule to 25 hours. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) a month ago said it was proposing to extend to 25 hours – but only for new aircraft in line with the European policy. \"I'm calling on the FAA to change the rulemaking,\" Homendy said, adding that she wanted to see aircraft retrofitted with 25-hour recorders, not just new planes. \"If that communication is not recorded, that is unfortunately a loss for us and a loss for the FAA and a loss for safety because that information is key not just for our investigation but for improving aviation safety,\" she said. Congress should take action in the FAA reauthorization bill to ensure the proposed rule is adopted, Homendy said. The two agencies have sparred in the past over the way in which the NTSB's recommendations are implemented. Debate about whether to adopt the longer recording time juggles considerations of cost or privacy against safety. The U.S. FAA has previously rejected the NTSB's call for retrofitting aircraft with new cockpit voice recorders, saying the costs would be significant at $741 million versus $196 million under incremental upgrades it proposed. Several pilot groups oppose longer recordings. \"(It) would significantly infringe upon the privacy rights of pilots and other flight crew members, as well as drastically increase the likelihood that CVR recordings will be misused or disseminated without authorization,\" the union representing pilots for Atlas Air told the FAA last month. The issue has taken on new urgency after a series of near miss incidents raised alarms about U.S. air safety. The NTSB has conducted 10 investigations since 2018 where the CVR was overwritten, including four runway incursions, Homendy said. The comments came as Japanese media reported that the voice recorder from a Japan Airlines Airbus A350 that collided with a Japanese Coastguard plane last week had been recovered. Some agencies have additionally called for video cockpit recordings, which most pilot groups oppose even more strongly because they could be used in courtrooms or unfairly leaked. France's BEA called for cockpit cameras to analyse what pilots are able to see following the mid-Atlantic crash of an Air France jet in 2009. Fifteen years on, litigation continues with appeals due to be heard in the second half next year. Historians attribute the invention of flight recorders to Australian scientist David Warren in the 1950s. They are mandatory and the aim is to preserve clues from sounds and data to help prevent future accidents. The industry has already phased out older technology like wire, foil or reels of magnetic tape though the BEA keeps old equipment to ensure it can read data from old planes. Although today's recorders use computer chips inside \"crash-survivable\" containers able to withstand g-forces 3,400 times the feeling of gravity, critics say the capacity for recordings housed inside them remains less than an ordinary cellphone.",

The lawsuitNew Tab , filed Tuesday in North Carolina state court by Eugene Moretti, one of the doctors at the Duke-affiliated Private Diagnostic Clinic, accused the university of using \"unlawful, unfair, and improper tactics to destroy the company and take over its business and goodwill.\" \"This lawsuit has no basis in fact or law and Duke will vigorously defend it,\" said Duke spokesperson Michael Schoenfeld in an email, adding that Duke and PDC had been engaged in \"productive dialogue\" and that Moretti did not represent PDC leadership. PDC's chief medical officer, David Attarian, declined to comment. PDC, founded in 1931, has about 1,850 physician members and $1 billion in annual revenue, and has maintained a close relationship with Duke and its affiliated hospital for decades, according to the lawsuit. Under an agreement formalized in 1972, PDC contributes revenue to Duke, and Duke provides PDC with laboratory facilities, offices and other resources. Moretti alleges that, after Duke's attempts to buy PDC beginning in 2008 were rebuffed by its members, it launched a takeover bid in 2020. Duke told the roughly 400 PDC doctors who do research at university facilities that they must join Duke or lose their funding, and tried to entice practice heads to move to Duke and bring their doctors with them, Moretti said. PDC's chair of family medicine, Anthony Viera, actually did move to Duke, and is also named as a defendant. Viera could not be reached for comment. The lawsuit comes amid a nationwide shift away from physician-owned practices. An analysisNew Tab of practice arrangements released by the American Medical Association in May found that 49.1% of physicians worked for wholly physician-owned practices in 2020, down 11% since 2012 and falling below half for the first time since the AMA began gathering data.

            "text": "Aerospace supplier Raytheon Technologies Corp (RTX.N)New Tab on Tuesday posted a near 5% rise in third-quarter revenue as air travel demand buoyed parts and services sales, though lingering supply chain issues spurred the company to trim its 2022 sales outlook. Raytheon, whose customers include Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab and Airbus SE (AIR.PA)New Tab , has benefited from the planemakers raising their output, increasing demand for engines, though labor shortages have hit deliveries. The resulting engine shortage has led to a feud with Airbus as the planemaker targets raising narrowbody production over the next few years. Supply-chain issues still dogged the company as components and materials failed to show up on time, Chief Financial Officer Neil Mitchill said in an interview. \"We did not see the acceleration in the material receipts that we expected and needed to see\" to meet the previous revenue guidance, he said. Raytheon lowered the midpoint of its 2022 sales guidance by 1.6% from $68.25 billion to $67.15 billion. But on the upside, demand for aftermarket sales and services has risen at Pratt & Whitney and Raytheon's avionics and parts unit Collins Aerospace, as planes were forced to use existing fleet for longer. In the third quarter, both Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney recorded double-digit sales. \"We note, Raytheon (Pratt and Collins) and Safran intend to implement substantial price increases in Q4 – likely above 10% – for commercial aftermarket parts and services. Consequently, airlines likely placed sizeable orders for parts in Q3 in advance of the Q4 price hikes,\" Melius Research analyst Rob Spingarn wrote in a note. However, supply chain constraints were a drag on the company's missiles and defense unit, where sales fell 6%. \"While we expect industry-wide challenges to continue near-term, we remain focused on operational excellence, including cost containment and program performance,\" Raytheon Chief Executive Greg Hayes said. The company raised the lower end of its adjusted earnings outlook for the year to a range of $4.70 to $4.80 per share, from its prior estimate of $4.60 to $4.80. On an adjusted basis, Raytheon's quarterly net income was $1.21 per share, compared to $1.26 a year earlier. Net sales for the quarter through September was $16.95 billion, compared with $16.21 billion a year earlier.",

            "text": "Sierra Space has tapped Boeing's former top lobbyist to lead a new, more aggressive government relations shop as the company courts government customers for its planned commercial space station. Tim Keating, a veteran political strategist who pushed Boeing (BA.N)New Tab through numerous procurement campaigns for over a decade, joined Sierra in early March as its Chief Strategy Officer and Senior Vice President of Global Government Operations, Keating told Reuters. Sierra Space, which spun off from billionaire-owned Sierra Nevada Corporation in 2021, is one of a handful of space industry players attempting to build a private space station that NASA hopes will replace the two decade-old International Space Station by 2030. Before Keating, the firm's lobbying efforts were led by one person. \"It wasn't really the emphasis, and now we're going to build out a team,\" Keating, who was also senior vice president of global government relations at Honeywell, said in an interview. \"It's going to be helping to tell our story, getting aggressive where we can.\" Partnering with billionaire Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, Sierra sees NASA and other countries' space agencies as crucial early customers for its planned space station, a massive orbital research lab and tourist destination dubbed Orbital Reef. Keating is the latest Boeing veteran to join Sierra, which last year hired Troy Lahr, former chief financial officer of Boeing's defense, space and security unit. Keating, who helped Boeing navigate through its worst-ever crisis following fatal 737 MAX crashes, left the planemaker in 2021. Sierra over the past decade has been building a spaceplane called Dreamchaser that will carry cargo and crew to the International Space Station for NASA. The spacecraft's first launch to space is slated for later this year aboard a United Launch Alliance rocket. A $1.4 billion funding round in 2021 allowed Sierra Space to double its workforce to nearly 2,000 and expand ground tests of an inflatable habitat central to the Orbital Reef station. The company has weighed plans to go public.",

            "text": "The longstanding collaboration between the United States and Russia in operating the International Space Station (ISS) appears to be on solid footing even as tensions between the two countries build over the Ukraine crisis. Some seven weeks after the Biden administration pledged its commitment to keeping ISS operational through 2030, NASA is still in talks with Roscosmos, its Russian counterpart, on a new \"crew exchange\" deal. Under such an agreement, the two former space rivals would routinely share flights to the station on each other's spacecrafts, the U.S. space agency said on Wednesday. The research platform, about the length of a football field and orbiting some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth, is currently home to a crew of four Americans, two Russians and a German astronaut working side-by-side in microgravity. One of the NASA astronauts, Mark Vande Hei, flew to the outpost in March 2021 aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft and is due to return to Earth on March 30 in a Soyuz with cosmonaut peers Pyotr Dubrov and Anton Shkaplerov. \"Ongoing station operations continue, including work to fly crew to the orbital outpost and return them safely to Earth,\" NASA spokesman Dan Huot said in an email to Reuters. Roscosmos did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment. The ISS itself was born in part from a foreign policy initiative to improve U.S.-Russian relations following the collapse of the Soviet Union and end of Cold War rivalry that spurred the original U.S.-Soviet space race. But U.S.-Russian ties have frayed since Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimea region from Ukraine, prompting Congress to ban new government contracts with U.S. companies using Russian rocket engineers for national security launches after 2022, according to the website SpacePolicyOnline.com. None of the sanctions levied by Washington in response to Russia's military incursions into eastern Ukraine this week were directed at Russia's space program. After ending its space shuttle program in 2011, the United States began paying Roscosmos to ferry NASA astronauts to and from the space station aboard Soyuz capsules. NASA resumed launching its own crew members from U.S. soil in 2020, even as it continued to hitch some rides on Soyuz. The new agreement would pave the way for more NASA crew to fly aboard Soyuz in exchange for Russian cosmonauts sharing rides with U.S. astronauts on SpaceX flights, all free of charge. In anticipation of such a deal, three Russian cosmonauts are already training at NASA's Johnson Space Center near Houston, NASA said. The United States, Russia, Canada, Japan and the 11-nation European Space Agency are separately hammering out terms of extending ISS operations beyond its current end date of 2024, as resupply of the station continues. A Cygnus cargo spacecraft launched for NASA on Saturday by Northrop Grumman (NOC.N)New Tab arrived at the orbital laboratory on Monday carrying 8,300 pounds of food, fuel and equipment. Underscoring the degree to which U.S. and Russian space interests are enmeshed, the Cygnus was flown to orbit atop an Antares rocket, whose first stage is largely designed and built in Ukraine and powered by two Russian-made RD-181 engines. Another Russian motor is the main engine of Atlas V rockets flown by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N)New Tab . Even before the Ukraine crisis escalated in recent weeks, U.S.-Russian space cooperation was shaken in mid-November when Russia blasted one of its own defunct surveillance satellites in an unannounced missile test that generated a debris field in low-Earth orbit, threatening the space station. All seven ISS crew members, including two cosmonauts, were forced to take shelter in their docked spaceships for about two hours afterward in case a quick getaway was needed. At the time, NASA chief Bill Nelson denounced the anti-satellite test as \"reckless.\" He was quoted by the Washington Post as saying Russia's space agency was likely surprised by the test and \"probably just as appalled as we are.\"",

The company also delivered two 777 freighters, two 767s, and six 787 Dreamliners.

In response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told RIA news agency that it was important not to forget what President Vladimir Putin had said in Volgograd on Thursday. In a speech, Putin said \"we have the means to respond, and it won't end with the use of armored vehicles, everyone must understand that.\" Reuters was first to report on a Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab proposal to field GLSDB for Ukraine in November. At the time it was expected GLSDB could be in Ukraine by spring. \"This demonstrates Boeing's commitment to answer the nation's call for rapid, effective capabilities for the United States and its international partners,\" a Boeing spokesperson said. \"Our team and Saab continue to work closely with the U.S. Government to solve pressing security challenges with speed and agility.\" GLSDB is made jointly with Sweden's SAAB AB (SAABb.ST)New Tab . A $1.725 billion portion of Friday's aid, comes from USAI funding, which allows President Joe Biden's administration to buy weapons from industry rather than from U.S. weapons stocks. The USAI funds pledged would also be used to buy two HAWK air defense firing units, counter drone systems, counter artillery and air surveillance radars, communications equipment, PUMA drones, and medical supplies. In addition to the USAI funds, $425 million worth of arms aid is coming from Presidential Drawdown Authority funds, which allows the president to take from current U.S. stocks in an emergency. That aid includes more precision-guided munitions for HIMARS launchers, 190 heavy machine guns with thermal imagery sights and associated ammunition to counter drones, mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles, claymore anti-personnel mines and Javelin anti-tank weapons. The U.S. has now pledged more then $29.3 billion worth of security assistance to Ukraine since the invasion.",

            "text": "An Italian supplier at the centre of recent industrial snags on the 787 Dreamliner airplane produced more than 4,000 non-compliant parts destined for Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab over five years, a preliminary report from Italian prosecutors shows. Initial results of an investigation launchedNew Tab earlier this year suggest that Manufacturing Process Specification (MPS), or its now-bankrupt predecessor company Processi Speciali, produced flawed parts between 2016 and 2021, according to the document. According to the report, seen by Reuters, the suspect titanium parts made it into 35 Boeing 787 fuselages. It added that the Brindisi-based supplier also made parts for the Boeing 767, a freighter model which is now also used as the basis for a U.S. Air Force tanker. The investigation aims to establish whether MPS or its predecessor firm produced flawed components that could threaten air safety, a risk that has been denied by Boeing. Boeing declined direct comment on the prosecutors' document, parts of which were first reported by Italian daily Il Corriere del Mezzogiorno. It reiterated, however, that airworthiness had not been affected. \"While our assessment is ongoing, this does not present an immediate safety of flight concern,\" a spokesperson said. In October, Boeing said some 787 Dreamliner parts supplied by MPS had been improperly manufactured over the previous three years, marking the latest in a series of industrial snags to hit the airliner. read more Italy's Leonardo (LDOF.MI)New Tab , which was the immediate customer for parts made by MPS and has said it too is a victim of the suspected failure to meet specifications, declined comment. A lawyer for former MPS Chief Executive Antonio Ingrosso, as well as for the former chief executive of its now-bankrupt predecessor Processi Speciali, also declined to comment. The U.S. Air Force did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether suspect parts had reached any of its 767-based KC-46 tankers, the first of which was delivered in 2019. The report emerged days after Italian prosecutors ordered the seizure of components intended for Boeing 787s from a Leonardo plant in Grottaglie, southern Italy. read more MPS was a sub-supplier until this year for two sections of 787 fuselage made by Leonardo, known as sections 44 and 46. In the report, prosecutors alleged that MPS or Processi Speciali made 4,189 parts using \"titanium and aluminium of different quality and origin\" from those ordered by the customer, breaching the relevant technical specifications. In particular, they said, it produced components using so-called 'grade 2 titanium' instead of a titanium alloy, they said, adding that the metal used had \"mechanical and structural strength properties far inferior to those of the alloy\". The affected parts included a clip for the doorframe of the left-side cargo door of the 787, the document said. It did not provide details of any suspect parts made for the older 767. Prosecutors allege MPS chose cheaper non-compliant metals to save costs and speed up production, resulting in a reduction of additional margins built in to the design to ensure safety. Eight individuals, including the former head of MPS and the former head of Processi Speciali, are under investigation for fraud and for actions threatening the safety of air transport. Prosecutors have said the two companies are also under investigation. Leonardo, which filed a lawsuit on Dec. 7, is being viewed by prosecutors as the injured party. The assets and factory of MPS will be put on sale at the beginning of next year as its predecessor Processi Speciali is being wound up, another court document seen by Reuters showed. Administrators for the companies did not reply to a request for comment. Prosecutors said on Saturday initial findings suggested MPS and Processi Speciali used non-compliant metals and violated technical specifications. They did not respond to Reuters request for comment on details of their preliminary report.",

            "text": "The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration late on Wednesday tightened pressure on Boeing (BA.N)New Tab by barring the troubled planemaker from expanding production of its best-selling 737 MAX narrowbody planes, following \"unacceptable\" quality issues. The unprecedented decision looked set to deepen turmoil at Boeing even as the FAA also agreed to allow the 737 MAX 9, which was grounded after a mid-air blowout on an Alaska Airlines (ALK.N)New Tab jet on Jan. 5, to resume flying once inspections were completed. The ability to resume flying was a relief to U.S. operators Alaska Airlines and United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab , which had been forced to cancel thousands of flights and aim to begin returning the planes to service on Friday and Sunday, respectively. But the FAA decision to keep Boeing from expanding production will have wide-ranging effects across the industry. Boeing is seeking to increase production of its single-aisle 737 MAX family to keep pace with demand and close a gap in the jet market with European planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab . Analysts have expressed concerns that extra scrutiny of Boeing factories following the MAX 9 door plug blowout would temper production increases for the smaller and more widely sold MAX 8, a key source of cash for Boeing and many suppliers. \"We will not agree to any request from Boeing for an expansion in production or approve additional production lines for the 737 MAX until we are satisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved,\" FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said. \"The quality assurance issues we have seen are unacceptable.\" Clarifying the order, the FAA subsequently told Reuters: \"That means Boeing can continue producing at the current monthly rate, but they cannot increase that rate.\" Boeing said it would continue to cooperate \"fully and transparently\" with the FAA and follow the agency's direction as it took action to strengthen safety and quality. The FAA offered no estimate of how long the limitation would last and did not specify the number of planes Boeing can produce each month. In October, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said it planned to reach production of 38 MAX planes per month by the end of 2023. Boeing's latest 737 master schedule, which sets the production pace for suppliers, calls for production to rise to 42 jets per month in February, 47.2 in August, 52.5 by February 2025 and 57.7 in October 2025, Reuters reported in December. However, Boeing's own production pace can lag the supplier master schedule. The FAA's decision could impact plans to stand up a new 737 MAX line in Everett, Washington, by mid-year 2024, following the end of production of Boeing's iconic 747 in the massive plant. The line, set to be the fourth 737 line overall and the first outside Renton, is needed to meet strong demand. Boeing declined to comment on any potential impact on the Everett line. Once accused of being too soft on Boeing, the FAA has toughened oversight since earlier MAX crashes led to a worldwide grounding, but Wednesday's intervention opens new territory, experts said. Jefferies analysts said the FAA halt to expansion seemed \"restrictive\" and lacked a definitive timeline. \"These actions (are) likely put pressure on any near-term production ramp, but appear to be more timing related,\" they added. Some airlines could be \"significantly\" impacted by any freeze on higher production, a senior industry source said, though many in the industry have already factored in some delays as aerospace firms continue to recover from the pandemic. United, for example, has 100 MAX deliveries scheduled for this year, according to a regulatory filing in October. Boeing shares fell 2% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. The FAA announcement came hours after Boeing delivered its first 737 MAX to a Chinese airline since March 2019, ending an almost five-year freeze and granting a respite for strained trade relations between the world's two largest economies. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun faced questions from senators on the Alaska Airlines incident in a series of meetings on Wednesday on Capitol Hill. Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said she would hold hearings to investigate the root cause of Boeing's safety lapses. \"The American flying public and Boeing line workers deserve a culture of leadership at Boeing that puts safety ahead of profits,\" Cantwell said. Calhoun said Boeing would restore public confidence in its airplanes. \"We don't put planes in the air that we don't have 100% confidence in,\" Calhoun told reporters. The China delivery is a boost during a difficult period for Boeing following the mid-air cabin blowout during a nearly full flight. No one was killed in the incident, but regulators and industry insiders are applying new scrutiny to the planemaker's manufacturing and quality control processes as a result. China is one of the fastest-growing aerospace markets, which the company projects will account for 20% of the world's aircraft demand through 2042. It was China that first grounded MAX jets after a pair of crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed nearly 350 people. While safety bans have been lifted with existing MAX jets flying inside China, new deliveries had remained on hold. A 737 MAX 8 registered to China Southern Airlines (600029.SS)New Tab left Seattle Boeing field in Washington state at 11:55 a.m. Pacific Time (1955 GMT) on Wednesday and landed in Honolulu almost seven hours later, flight data from FlightRadar24 shows, before its final destination in China. Boeing declined to comment. China Southern and China's aviation regulator did not immediately respond to requests to comment.",

            "text": "The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is launching a formal investigation into the Boeing 737 MAX 9 after a cabin panel blew off an Alaska Airlines (ALK.N)New Tab flight last week in mid-air, forcing an emergency landing, the regulator said on Thursday. The FAA on Saturday grounded 171 Boeing (BA.N)New Tab MAX jets with the same panel pending safety inspections. Most are operated by U.S. carriers Alaska Airlines and United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab . The incident was the latest in a series of events that have shaken confidence in the aircraft manufacturer. Talks between Boeing, the FAA and airlines on revised inspection and maintenance instructions from Boeing that the regulator must approve before airlines can resume flying the planes ended for the day on Thursday without agreement, according to sources with knowledge of the matter. The FAA said the Alaska Airlines incident \"should have never happened and it cannot happen again.\" The agency told Boeing in a letter dated Wednesday that the investigation was to determine if the planemaker had failed to ensure completed products conformed to its approved design and were in a condition for safe operation under FAA rules. The agency cited \"additional discrepancies\" in other 737 MAX 9 planes. \"We will cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA and the NTSB on their investigations,\" Boeing said in a statement. Boeing shares closed down 2.3% on Thursday and have fallen more than 10% since the incident. Alaska Airlines and United said on Monday they had found loose parts on multiple grounded aircraft during preliminary checks, raising new concerns about how Boeing's best-selling jet family is manufactured. The two carriers have canceled hundreds of flights since Saturday with the MAX 9 planes grounded, including another 230 by United and 152 by Alaska Airlines for Friday. A growing number of U.S. lawmakers expressed broader concerns about the FAA and Boeing and questions about the planemaker's manufacturing quality control. \"Given the previous tragic crashes of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, we are deeply concerned that the loose bolts represent a systemic issue with Boeing’s capabilities to manufacture safe airplanes,\" Senators Ed Markey, JD Vance and Peter Welch wrote to Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun. Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell in a letter to the FAA questioned Boeing’s quality control and said it appeared the FAA’s oversight processes \"have not been effective\" in ensuring Boeing produces airplanes in safe operating conditions. Reuters reported on Tuesday the planemaker told staff the findings were being treated as a \"quality control issue\" and checks were under way at Boeing and supplier Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N)New Tab . Calhoun told CNBC on Wednesday that a \"quality escape\" was at issue that led to the MAX 9 being in the air that suffered the cabin blowout. In an internal speech to staff on Tuesday, Calhoun said: \"We’re going to approach this number one acknowledging our mistake.\" The Stritmatter law firm filed a class-action lawsuit against Boeing on Thursday in King County, Washington on behalf of passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight, citing Calhoun's admission of Boeing's \"mistake\" in connection with the MAX 9. Daniel Laurence, an attorney for the passengers, said the flight \"has caused economic, physical and ongoing emotional consequences.\" Boeing declined to comment. More travelers are checking the model of an aircraft before booking flights after the Alaska Airlines incident, several travel operators said. The Alaska Airlines aircraft, which had been in service for just eight weeks, took off from Portland, Oregon last Friday and was flying at 16,000 feet(4,900 m) when the panel tore off the plane, blowing open the cockpit door. Pilots returned the jet to Portland, with only minor injuries suffered by passengers. Boeing’s manufacturing practices \"need to comply with the high safety standards they’re legally accountable to meet,\" the FAA said. The NTSB is looking at whether bolts attaching the panel were properly tightened or missing. U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Wednesday declined to say when the FAA may allow the planes to resume flights but said Boeing must ensure its planes are \"100% safe.\". In 2019, global authorities grounded all MAX planes for 20 months after 346 people died in crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia linked to poorly designed cockpit software.. The crisis eroded Boeing's 50% share of the passenger jet market and the company ended 2023 in second place behind rival Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab in aircraft deliveries for the fifth year running. Airbus on Thursday posted record annual jet orders, booking nearly 2,100 net new orders in 2023 while Boeing booked 1,314 net new orders. Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told reporters it was closely monitoring the investigation of its rival. \"We will be taking each and every learning and we would expect Spirit to do exactly the same,\" he added. Brazilian airline Gol (GOLL4.SA)New Tab said quality issues across the aviation industry must be assessed and risk mitigation plans put in place. Panama's civil aviation authority said it had temporarily prohibited operations of 21 of Copa Airlines' MAX 9s.",

            "text": "NASA's towering next-generation moon rocket blasted off from Florida early on Wednesday on its debut flight, a crewless voyage inaugurating the U.S. space agency's Artemis exploration program 50 years after the final Apollo moon mission. The 32-story Space Launch System (SLS) rocket surged off the launch pad from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral at 1:47 a.m. EST (0647 GMT), to send its Orion capsule on a three-week test journey. About 90 minutes after launch, the rocket's upper stage fired thrusters for a \"trans-lunar injection\" burn propelling Orion out of Earth orbit on course for the moon. That put the capsule on track for a 25-day flight that will bring it to within 60 miles (97 km) of the lunar surface before sailing 40,000 miles (64,374 km) beyond the moon and back to Earth. Liftoff came on the third attempt at launching the long-delayed, multibillion-dollar rocket, after 10 weeks beset by numerous technical mishaps, back-to-back hurricanes and two excursions trundling the spacecraft out of its hangar to the launch pad. Wednesday's launch was not without its own drama. A three-man \"red team\" was scrambled out to the launch pad in the final hours of the countdown to tighten bolts on a loose connection identified as the source of a potentially flight-thwarting fuel leak. Although specially trained to venture into the \"blast zone\" around a fully fueled rocket, the three were later hailed as heroes who may well have saved the mission. \"It's a great day,\" a beaming NASA chief Bill Nelson later said in a brief post-launch webcast interview. Dubbed Artemis I, the mission marked the first flight for the combined SLS rocket and Orion capsule, built by Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N)New Tab , respectively, under contract with NASA. It also signals a major change in direction for NASA's post-Apollo human spaceflight program after decades focused on low-Earth orbit with space shuttles and the International Space Station. (See graphicNew Tab ) Named for the ancient Greek goddess of the hunt - and Apollo's twin sister - Artemis aims to return astronauts to the moon's surface as early as 2025. Twelve astronauts walked on the moon during six Apollo missions from 1969 to 1972, the only spaceflights yet to place humans on the lunar surface. But Apollo, born of the Cold War-era U.S.-Soviet space race, was less science-driven than Artemis. The new moon program has enlisted commercial partners such as Elon Musk's SpaceX and the space agencies of Europe, Canada and Japan to eventually establish a long-term lunar base as a stepping stone to even more ambitious human voyages to Mars. The Artemis I countdown climaxed with the rocket's four main R-25 engines and its twin solid-rocket boosters roaring to life, producing 8.8 million pounds of thrust that sent the spacecraft streaking skyward and lighting up the night sky over Florida's central Atlantic space coast. The rocket's thunder shook the space center as a throng of spectators cheered and screamed with excitement. \"It was just incredible to see. It was so bright, so loud, you could feel it,\" said NASA astronaut Jessica Meir, among those who could be selected for a future Artemis crew. Addressing mission control moments after liftoff, Artemis launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson saluted the hard work of her colleagues. \"We are all part of something incredibly special, the first launch of Artemis, the first step in returning our country to the moon and on to Mars,\" she said to applause. The capsule is expected to splash down at sea on Dec. 11. Getting the SLS-Orion spacecraft off the ground was a key hurdle for the ambitious Artemis program. Its first voyage is intended to put the vehicle through its paces in a rigorous test flight, pushing its design limits to prove the spacecraft is suitable to fly astronauts. If the mission succeeds, a crewed Artemis II flight around the moon and back could come as early as 2024, followed within a few more years by the program's first lunar landing of astronauts, one of them a woman, with Artemis III. Billed as the most powerful, complex rocket in the world, the SLS represents the biggest new vertical launch system NASA has built since the Saturn V of the Apollo era. Although no people were aboard, Orion carried a simulated crew of three - one male and two female mannequins - fitted with sensors to measure radiation levels and other stresses that astronauts would experience. A top objective is to test the durability of Orion's heat shield during re-entry as it hits Earth's atmosphere at 24,500 miles (39,429 km) per hour, or 32 times the speed of sound, on its return from lunar orbit - much faster than re-entries from the space station. The heat shield is designed to withstand re-entry friction expected to raise temperatures outside the capsule to nearly 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,760 degrees Celsius). The spacecraft also is set to release a payload of 10 miniaturized science satellites, called CubeSats, including one designed to map the abundance of ice deposits on the moon's south pole, where Artemis seeks to eventually land astronauts. Sending astronauts to Mars, an order of magnitude more challenging than lunar landings, is expected to take at least another decade and a half to achieve. More than a decade in development with years of delays and budget overruns, the SLS-Orion spacecraft has so far cost NASA least $37 billion, including design, construction, testing and ground facilities. NASA's Office of Inspector General has projected total Artemis costs at $93 billion by 2025. NASA calls the program a boon to space exploration that has generated tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in commerce.",

            "text": "The U.S. Export-Import Bank plans \"aggressive\" measures to restore its standing in the business community and to bump up credit volumes running at roughly a quarter of their levels from 2014 before it was hobbled first by Congress and then a global pandemic, the bank's new president said. In that span, EXIM faded in the minds of customers and foreign governments - and many simply never got to know it, Reta Jo Lewis told Reuters on Wednesday. She plans to fix that with an \"EXIM 101\" education program to introduce new industries and small businesses to the lender's services and rebuild its relationships with foreign governments and U.S. exporters. Moreover, Lewis, the first person of color to head the 88-year-old export credit agency, said she aims to steadily build up EXIM's lending totals \"on a deal-by-deal basis.\" \"The important thing that I've seen is that while we were out of the market, you know, others stepped in. So that means that we've got to be aggressive,\" Lewis said. \"We've got to be out there meeting large, small and medium-sized companies to let them know that EXIM has this financing tool that they can use.\" Republicans in Congress in July 2015 sought to permanently shutter EXIM, charging it was providing \"corporate welfare\" through cheap export financing for Boeing (BA.N)New Tab , General Electric (GE.N)New Tab , Caterpillar (CAT.N)New Tab and other corporate giants. Its charter was restored after four months, but Republicans blocked EXIM board nominees for four more years, limiting it to loans of $10 million or less and shutting it out of the market for aircraft and major infrastructure projects. During the void, GE was among U.S. firms that turned elsewhere, agreeing in 2015 to move manufacturingNew Tab of oilfield gas generator engines to Canada from Waukesha, Wisconsin, in a deal to access Canadian export financing, costing 236 U.S. manufacturing jobs. A spokesperson for Austrian-based Innio Group, which acquired those facilities when it bought GE's distributed power business in 2018, said the firm would not be seeking EXIM financing support. After its full lending powers were restored in 2019, other setbacks came from the COVID-19 pandemic's hit to export demand, and halts in aircraft deliveries for Boeing, traditionally EXIM's largest customer, following the 737 MAX grounding and 787 production problems. Meanwhile, China has continued to dwarf EXIM's efforts, providing $11 billion in official medium and long-term export credit in 2021, compared with $2.2 billion for the United States, according to EXIM's annual competitiveness reportNew Tab . Including short-term deals for working capital finance and credit insurance, EXIM in fiscal 2021 authorized $5.8 billion total support - far below its $20.7 billion volume in 2014. Lewis, who marks her 100th day on the job on Thursday, said she does not have a specific volume target for EXIM, but wants to see higher numbers each year - a sign that \"American companies are winning.\" She said a $600 billion private-sector-led infrastructure push from G7 countries announced last week to rival China's Belt and Road program, including $200 billion from the United States, represents a significant opportunity to win new customers. read more The fomer State Department official and congressional affairs director for the German Marshall Fund said she plans a trip to Africa to meet with officials and businesses later this year. EXIM has also launched a transformational exports programNew Tab to compete with China in key emerging export areas such as biomedical technology, renewable energy and quantum computing. But reaching into new industries and more small businesses requires EXIM to take a more proactive approach to marketing, she said. \"We can't just sit back and just wait for (business) to walk in the door. That's an old-school method,\" she said. \"We've got to be talking to industries all over this country and all over this world about what it is that we do.\"",

            "text": "The Asia-Pacific aviation industry's slow recovery from the pandemic amid government restrictions will cast a shadow over the Singapore Airshow next week, despite signs of improvement as concerns over the Omicron variant recede. The biennial event has bookended the pandemic, with the 2020 edition disrupted by the virus emerging from China and the latest show coming as the industry attempts to plot a way out of what became its biggest and most costly crisis. International passenger travel in the region was down 93% from pre-pandemic levels last year, leaving airlines heavily reliant on freight for revenue, and the Chinese outbound tourism market remains closed. But there are signs of a rebound this year, Skyscanner booking data shows, as countries such as Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam and Australia reopen to more vaccinated tourists without quarantine. read more The head of Finnair , which specialises in serving Asia from its Nordic hub, expressed optimism about a return towards normal business later this year. read more Military demand is also picking up as regional economies recover from pandemic-induced slumps and countries look to bolster their capabilities, as highlighted by Indonesia's $8.1 billion orderNew Tab for 42 Rafale fighter jets on Thursday. Planemakers Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab , Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and Lockheed Martin (LMT.N)New Tab will send senior executives to the Singapore Airshow from Feb. 15-18, using it as an opportunity for now rare face-to-face meetings with customers. But there will be around two-thirds fewer exhibitorsNew Tab than 2020 at Asia's biggest aerospace gathering, with the challenges of holding the show mirroring the travel difficulties that have pushed some of the region's airlines to the brink. Some industry executives have pulled out, concerned about restrictions including daily testing, no intermingling during mealtime, mandatory masks in the tropical heat as well as hotel isolation if they test positive. Singapore-based aviation analyst Brendan Sobie said he expected a quiet, locally oriented gathering with many of the overseas executives holding meetings in the city centre. \"The concern from many exhibitors is a lack of customers visiting,\" Sobie said. The Asia-Pacific region accounts for 35% of the world's commercial aircraft fleet but only 4% of order announcements at air shows over the last decade were made in Singapore, according to broker Jefferies, partly because it is held at the start of the year when purchasing activity is usually thin. During the pandemic, most Asian airlines have focused on deferring deliveries and handing back planes to lessors rather than placing fresh orders, though Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI)New Tab in December signed a preliminary deal for seven Airbus A350 freighters. That deal, which also involves reducing orders for passenger planes, could be firmed up next week along with announcements from both Airbus and Boeing for new services deals. read more Boeing last month launchedNew Tab a freighter version of its 777X widebody that will compete against the A350 freighter. PR efforts at the show will focus on the benefits of new planes in cutting carbon emissions as the industry targets \"net zero\" emissions by 2050 through biofuels and engine technology. Environmentalists say the industry is not doing enough. The show - which typically features displays of military hardware and aerobatics - comes as Southeast Asia remains a key stage for a rivalry between the United States and China. China's extensive territorial claims in the South China Sea, which it says are based on historic maps, have put it at odds with Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam, which have competing claims to islands and features. Collin Koh, a research fellow at Singapore's Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, said there was interest from military buyers in big-ticket purchases such as new-generation fighter jets, though pandemic-strained budgets remained tight. \"Drones, fixed- and rotary-winged transports, maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, for example, would be more sought after given the utility of these assets for a whole range of peacetime purposes,\" he added.",

            "title": "Vulcan rocket's space debut will be crucial for Boeing-Lockheed venture as sale talks loom",
            "text": "A lot is riding on the first launch of the new Vulcan rocket by the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and Lockheed Martin (LMT.N)New Tab . A successful launch at Cape Canaveral next week would allow ULA to fulfill a deep backlog of missions worth hundreds of millions of dollars and establish a greater competitive footing with Elon Musk's SpaceX. And it could prove vital to plans by the two U.S. aerospace firms to sell their joint venture. \"It's a very nervous time for them,\" said George Sowers, ULA's former chief scientist, who was key to Vulcan's creation. \"It's really the future of their company.\" The debut mission is a long-awaited milestone after months of various delays in the final stretch of Vulcan's development, and following a testing mishap last year with a Vulcan upper-stage booster. ULA CEO Tory Bruno has said that Vulcan has performed well during recent ground tests. \"That is an incredibly complicated machine, it's tremendously powerful. Everything has to work,\" Bruno said Saturday at Vulcan's launch pad. \"It is always inherently risky to fly a rocket. But what we're good at is managing that risk.\" The mission checklist includes carrying a moon lander that is aiming to make the first U.S. lunar soft landing in half a century. The rocket will be using for the first time engines supplied by Jeff Bezos' space firm Blue Origin. Vulcan's launch also comes as Boeing and Lockheed, which formed ULA in a 2006 merger of their rocket programs, are looking to sell the jointly owned venture, according to three people familiar with the talks. The talks have been a complex, drawn-out process for which Vulcan's launch could have crucial implications, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. ULA declined to comment on any potential deal talks. Bruno has previously said his company could be ripe for an acquisition. Boeing and Lockheed declined to comment. Vulcan's debut launch, scheduled for 2:18 a.m. ET (0718 GMT) on Monday, is the culmination of a years-long development effort sprung largely from ULA's need to replace its current Atlas V rocket. That rocket's Russian-imported engines drew criticism from lawmakers that led to its planned retirement. The retirement of Atlas - plus Vulcan's other rocket, Delta - will leave the 200-foot-tall (60-m) Vulcan to handle dozens of lucrative missions and serve as the company's sole challenger to SpaceX's reusable Falcon 9. Vulcan's debut mission will send a privately built lander from space robotics firm Astrobotic to the moon. But the launch itself will also serve as the first of two certification flights required by the U.S. Space Force before Vulcan can fly Pentagon satellites. Space Force is a core customer for Vulcan - the military branch in 2020 picked ULA's Vulcan and its retiring Atlas V to launch 60% of the Pentagon's missions through around 2027. Priced lower than its predecessors at roughly $110 million per launch, Vulcan will seek to reclaim market share from Falcon 9, which is priced at roughly $62 million per launch. SpaceX's cheaper flights have eroded ULA's dominance of government satellite launches in the past decade. Vulcan will also compete with Blue Origin's forthcoming New Glenn rocket, which uses the same engines as Vulcan. Acquisition talks for ULA have been underway for more than a year, with dozens of firms, including Blue Origin, having expressed interest, the sources said. Blue Origin did not respond to a request for comment. Boeing's and Lockheed's rationale and timing for selling ULA are unclear. But there have been significant changes to the U.S. space industry since ULA's formation in 2006, when it was created to dominate government launches and clinch some commercial demand from the then-nascent satellite market. Growth of the commercial market was slower than expected, said Richard McKinney, an aerospace consultant and former director of the Air Force's space acquisition unit until 2007. \"But it looks like we're about there now.\" Amazon's (AMZN.O)New Tab planned Kuiper network is set to bring in crucial launch revenue for ULA. That has helped provide Vulcan with a multibillion-dollar backlog of roughly 70 missions split somewhat evenly between government and commercial customers, Bruno has said. Vulcan's development and ULA's shift away from its Atlas and Delta rockets have made estimates of the company's valuation hard to pin down, but analysts speculate it could be $2 billion to $3 billion. Boeing and Lockheed each have their own competing space units. Lockheed, among other pursuits, has ventured into building moon rovers and made strategic investments in ABL Space, a small-launch startup with plans to build larger rockets in the future. Boeing's space program has struggled, primarily with its long-delayed Starliner astronaut capsule that rivals SpaceX's more established Crew Dragon. Troubles with Starliner development have cost Boeing some $1.5 billion since 2014. New ownership could allow ULA to innovate beyond the launch sector in ways its corporate parents were unwilling to allow, former ULA chief scientist Sowers said. \"The charter of the company was fixed, and it was very limiting,\" he said. \"They're always competing and they couldn't agree on anything. We were not allowed to innovate.\"",

            "text": "Global airlines are setting drawn out timelines to a full recovery. Some carriers, particularly in Asia, think they will only fly at or over pre-pandemic capacity levels in 2024 or later. It’s a bumpy and lopsided journey. One reason for the long timeline is a staffing shortage. Airlines didn’t rehire quickly enough to support the sudden recovery in demand and are now overpromising and underdelivering. In Europe, flight cancellations increased by some 90% in March to over 14,000New Tab according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company, though April numbers fared better. Australia’s Qantas Airways (QAN.AX)New Tab cancelled 600 domestic flightsNew Tab in March alone. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects global traveller numbers will only reach 4 billion in 2024, roughly the same level as in 2019. Travel patterns are shifting too. Globally, domestic flights are picking up at a quicker pace. It makes the rebound a harder slog for airlines that heavily rely on international passenger traffic; that cohort of travellers will only fly as often as they did by 2025, IATA reckonsNew Tab . Asian hub carriers like $16.5 billion Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI)New Tab are particularly strained. A reduced fleet, a delay in delivery of Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 777-9 aircraft, and slow reopening from China - which historically accounted for about 15% of group pre-pandemic capacity, per Morningstar analyst estimates – weigh heavily. The carrier declines to give a timeline for when it will hit 100% of its January 2020 available seat kilometres (ASKs) - a measure of an airline’s seats multiplied by kilometres flown - despite pestering from analysts. Part of the reluctance is understandable. Networks and flight frequencies have changed, altering the underlying composition of capacity. The Middle East has benefitted from rerouting because of the Ukraine war and it, alongside Africa and South America, are the only regions flying clear above pre-pandemic levels. The global total of ASKs is down 4.4% since May 2019, per Cirium. A long slog back to 100% is not necessarily a big problem. Singapore Airlines, for example, posted a record net profit of S$2.2 billion ($1.6 billion) for the financial year ended March. Its net margin rose to 12% up from 4% in 2019 partly because it is able to charge high prices for tickets as Asian rivals are slower to get their planes back into the sky. Even so, record orders of almost 1,000 planes combined from India’s top two carriers, IndiGo (INGL.NS)New Tab and Air India, signal intensifying competition in the region ahead. Peers from Cathay Pacific (0293.HK)New Tab to Deutsche Lufthansa (LHAG.DE)New Tab and Britain’s IAG (ICAG.L)New Tab are more readily committing to a timeline for a full recovery but Singapore Airlines' total shareholder returns are 18.6% since the pandemic, versus negative at rivals. And whether competitors can deliver is still up in the air. Follow @t__shum on Twitter (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.) CONTEXT NEWS Indian budget airline IndiGo announced on June 19 the biggest ever plane order by number of aircraft with a deal for 500 Airbus jets. A day later, rival Air India firmed up an order for 470 Airbus and Boeing aircraft, Reuters reported. Qantas Airways on May 19 said that it expects to return to 100% of pre-pandemic international capacity by March 2024. Singapore Airlines posted its first annual net profit in four years on May 16, logging a record S$2.2 billion ($1.6 billion) for the year ended March 31. The company said the group’s passenger capacity reached 79% of pre-Covid levels in March, and noted other airlines in the region are at 58%. It expects group capacity to rise to around 83% in the first half of the current fiscal year.",

The Boeing 737, repatriating Indians stranded in Dubai due to the coronavirus pandemic, overshot the table-top runway and crashedNew Tab while landing at Calicut International Airport in the southern state of Kerala in heavy rain on Aug. 8, 2020. \"The probable cause of the accident was the non-adherence to standard operating procedures by the pilot flying,\" says the report by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, a division of the Ministry of Civil Aviation that probes plane accidents. The pilot \"continued an unstabilised approach and landed beyond the touchdown zone, halfway down the runway\", instead of doing a \"go around\", the agency says in the 257-page report, published after a year-long investigation. A go-around is a standard procedure in which the pilot abandons a landing attempt deemed unsafe and tries again. In spite of being asked to go around by the pilot monitoring the landing, the pilot flying the aircraft failed to do so, the agency said, and the monitoring pilot also failed to take over the controls and execute the order. The aircraft had already made one failed attempt to land before it overran the 2,700-metre (8,900-foot) runway. The airport is known as a table-top because its runways have steep drops at one or both ends. The crash at the airport in Kozhikode was India's worst passenger aircraft accident since 2010, when another Air India Express flight from Dubai overshot a table-top runway in Mangalore, a city in the south, and slid down a hill, killing 158 people.",

In December, some victims' relatives said the Department had violated their rights when it struck the January 2021 agreement with Boeing over the two crashes in a five-month period that killed 346 people. They filed a motion arguing the United States government \"lied and violated their rights through a secret process\", and asked a U.S. judge to rescind Boeing's immunity from criminal prosecution, which was part of the $2.5 billion agreement, and order the planemaker publicly arraigned on the felony charges. The Justice Department said in a court filing late Wednesday the meeting with Garland would take place \"within the next week\", and that it wanted to delay responding to the families' motion until then. A Garland spokesman and Boeing both declined comment. The January 2021 settlement allowed Boeing to avoid prosecution, and includes a fine of $243.6 million, compensation to airlines of $1.77 billion and a $500 million crash-victim fund over fraud conspiracy charges related to the plane's flawed design. Michael Stumo, whose daughter Samya died in the Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crash, said he was pleased Garland will meet with crash victim relatives. \"Attorney General Garland has a chance to fix this injustice, hold Boeing accountable, and deter future corporate criminal behavior,\" Stumo said. The Justice Department deal capped a 21-month investigation into the design and development of the 737 MAX following the two crashes, in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019. The crashes \"exposed fraudulent and deceptive conduct by employees of one of the world's leading commercial airplane manufacturers,\" the Justice Department said. In October, a former Boeing chief technical pilot for Boeing was charged with fraud for deceiving federal regulators evaluating the company's 737 MAX jet. He has denied wrongdoing. The crashes, which cost Boeing some $20 billion and led to the plane's 20-month grounding that was lifted in late 2020, prompted Congress to pass legislation reforming new airplane certification. The $243 million fine, which the Justice Department said was at the \"low end\" of the sentencing guidelines, represented the amount Boeing saved by not implementing full-flight simulator training.",

            "text": "U.S. low-cost carrier Allegiant Air confirmed plans on Wednesday to buy 50 new Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 737 MAX jets worth $5.5 billion at list prices in a switch of supplier and strategy as it gears up for a post-pandemic rebound in tourism. The order marks what one analyst, reacting to purchase plans first reported by ReutersNew Tab on Tuesday, called a stark change of approach by the fast-growing domestic carrier, which had previously relied mainly on used Airbus aircraft. Allegiant \"has experienced one of the strongest recoveries of U.S. airlines,\" Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu wrote, adding that the order is evidence of post-pandemic confidence in leisure travel \"vastly outperforming corporate travel.\" The Las Vegas-based carrier will buy 30 737 MAX 7 aircraft and 20 737 MAX 8-200 aircraft, making it the launch customer for that larger variant in the United States, Chief Financial Officer Greg Anderson told Reuters. It will take delivery of 10 of the jets in 2023, 24 in 2024, and 16 in 2025, he added in an interview on Wednesday. The deal is a boost for Boeing Co after two key medium-haul customers, Qantas (QAN.AX)New Tab and several affiliates of Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA)New Tab , switched to Airbus (AIRF.PA)New Tab in December. \"With this deal, and these new MAX aircraft, it will provide the ability to grow into 400 more routes,\" Anderson said. He declined to name city pairs targeted under the expansion but said the planes would add seating capacity and 20% fuel savings compared to Allegiant's older Airbus aircraft. Boeing's shares were up1.3% in midday trade while the stock of airline parent Allegiant Travel Co fell more than 8%. Colin Scarola, vice president at CFRA Research, reckons that the Boeing order could undermine Allegiant's cost advantage as differential and mixed fleet tends to result in \"significant\" operating costs. Scarola said the order also suggests that market inventory might be depleted for the much-cheaper highly used planes the low-cost airline typically likes to buy. Allegiant has until now relied mainly on cheaper second-hand planes to reduce costs - a strategy that allows it to use jets less intensively and attack thinly populated routes, with some planes flying no more than twice a week, according to Jefferies. Raymond James analysts said this approach is well suited for what is expected to be a \"choppy recovery\" but warned of the operational inefficiencies caused by having a mixed fleet. Allegiant currently operates 110 Airbus A319s and A320s and will continue buying A320s in the used market, Anderson said. It has some 50 aircraft – 20 A320s and 30 A319s - that it may need to retire over the coming decade. Analysts said the deal for new jets pointed to an aggressive offer from Boeing while experts have said Airbus remains hampered by high parts costs for the A220, another type examined by Allegiant. Boeing has denied slashing prices to win deals. Wednesday's expansion is the latest sign of growth among \"ultra-low-cost\" carriers that combine rock-bottom fares with optional charges. Such carriers are expected to emerge in a position of relative strength from the COVID-19 pandemic. \"Our bookings are greater than they were in 2019,\" Anderson said, referring to pre-pandemic travel levels. Still, like many airlines, Allegiant has voiced uncertainties over fuel prices, labor and supply chain problems as well as mounting inflationary pressures. Mexico's Viva Aerobus in December announced a commercial alliance with Allegiant to offer flights between the United States and Mexico. read more",

            "text": "Ryanair (RYA.I)New Tab on Monday reported its first quarterly profit since before COVID-19, but downgraded its annual forecast to a loss as it prepared to slash winter prices to build momentum for what it believes will be a bumper summer next year. Europe's largest budget airline, which flew more passengers this summer than any European rival, made a profit of 225 million euros ($260 million) for the three months to the end of September, marking its first quarterly profit since the final three months of 2019. But the Dublin-based airline said it expected a loss of between 100 million and 200 million euros for the financial year that ends on March 31, a downgrade from its July forecastNew Tab of \"somewhere between a small loss and breakeven\", citing fare discounting and higher fuel costs. \"There is no doubt that the remainder of the fiscal year will be challenging, the winter will be tough\" Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told investors. But keeping prices low and passenger numbers high over the winter will \"set us up strongly for a very strong recovery\" in the summer of 2022 when ticket prices should return to pre-COVID levels \"if not better\", O'Leary said. Flights for next summer are booking at prices around 5% higher than 2019, he said. That should help lift the airline to an annual profit in its next financial year, which ends in March 2023, he said. The contraction of European short-haul capacity by up to 20% from pre-COVID levels next year and around 10% the following year will allow for \"dramatic market share gains,\" he added. Ryanair carried 39.1 million passengers in the six months ended September, more than double the number in the period last year but 54% fewer than the same months in 2019. O'Leary said Ryanair hoped to fly 103-104 million passengers in the year to March, compared to 149 million in the year before the pandemic. Ryanair will then fly a record 165 million passengers next year and will likely beat a 2026 target of 225 million passengers a year, O'Leary said. read more Ryanair's after-tax loss of 48 million euros for the six months to September, which included a 273 million loss in the first quarter, was slightly worse than the 43 million euros forecast in a company poll of analysts. Its shares briefly dropped more than 4% to 16.2 euros in early trade. They peaked at 17.28 euros during a bullish investor call before settling back to 16.95 at 1352 GMT, flat on the day. Ryanair announced on Monday that it was looking at delisting from the London Stock Exchange in coming months due to a fall in trading volumes there after Brexit forced it to impose restrictions on British-owned shares. read more O'Leary also ramped up a war of words with his main aircraft supplier Boeing, saying the planemaker was \"delusionary\" for imposing a double-digit percentage price increase for 737 MAX 10 planes, which he said had led to the collapse of talks earlier this year. read more He said he did not think Boeing would meet a target of delivering 65 of an existing order of 737 MAX200 jets by April, but was \"reasonably confident\" they would arrive in time for next year's summer peak. A Boeing spokesperson said it valued Ryanair's business but that it would continue to be disciplined and make decisions that made sense for the company. ($1 = 0.8651 euros)",

            "text": "The United States and Vietnam agreed on Sunday to upgrade their diplomatic relations in a historic step for the two former foes, paving the way for business deals and possible new investment. But for every winner there is often a loser. These nations, companies and groups are unlikely to benefit from closer relations between Washington and Hanoi: Vietnam has been careful to stress that its elevated ties with Washington would not upset relations with Beijing, fearing a backlash from China. But Washington's elevation to the same tier as Beijing in Vietnam's ranking will inevitably have an impact on China. Beijing could lose business deals, especially in the semiconductors field, where Washington pledged to boost Vietnam's industry with the explicit goal of reducing the sector's exposure to China-related risks. \"China believes that the development of bilateral relations between countries cannot target third parties,\" China's foreign affairs ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Monday, urging the U.S. to \"abandon hegemony and Cold War thinking\". Vietnam is a close partner of Russia and one of the top importers of its weapons, which are estimated to comprise about 80% of the Southeast Asian country's arsenal. The White House had no new arms deals to announce, but the new ties may facilitate future supplies from the U.S. or its partners. That would inevitably reduce Vietnam's reliance on Russian gear, although Hanoi is currently negotiating a new possible arms deal with Moscow. During U.S. President Joe Biden's visit to Hanoi, U.S. planemaker Boeing (BA.N)New Tab agreed to sell 50 of its 737 MAX jets to flag carrier Vietnam Airlines (HVN.HM)New Tab . The Vietnamese company currently operates narrowbody jets from Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab , Boeing's direct rival. The deal marked what is known in the industry as a \"flip\" - when either Boeing or Airbus poach a customer from each other, especially in the ultra-competitive narrowbody market. Such defections are relatively rare because of the expense of introducing new pilot training and spare parts, as well as the complexity of switching to a new fleet. \"We do not have any comment on a decision that does not involve Airbus,\" an Airbus spokesperson said. \"However, Vietnam Airlines is an important customer and we look forward to building further on our long-standing partnership.\" The White House fact sheet issued during Biden's visit weighed in at over 2,600 words. The section on human rights contained just 112 words, including a sub-heading. \"The Biden administration is clearly sidelining human rights in the interest of advancing partnerships with governments it sees as strategically important,\" said Carolyn Nash, Asia advocacy director at Amnesty International. Vietnam holds at least 159 political prisoners and at least 22 others were in detention pending eventual trial before a court controlled by the ruling Communist Party, Human Rights Watch said. The two countries agreed on Sunday on \"enhanced commitment to meaningful dialogue\". Washington has agreed to significantly boost support to Vietnam's chip and artificial intelligence industry, announcing new investments from U.S. companies, including a $1.6 billion semiconductors factory to be built by Amkor, and partnerships between U.S. AI giants Nvidia (NVDA.O)New Tab and Microsoft (MSFT.O)New Tab and Vietnamese companies. That could affect Malaysia and India, Vietnam's top rivals among emerging Asian nations in semiconductors and AI, respectively. Among the deals announced by the White House was a partnership between solar company AMI and U.S. conglomerate Honeywell (HON.O)New Tab to launch \"Vietnam's first ever battery energy storage system\". That may have not pleased Fluence (FLNC.O)New Tab , a Nasdaq-listed company whose parent organisations are U.S. energy firm AES (AES.N)New Tab and Germany's Siemens (SIEGn.DE)New Tab that produces battery energy storage systems in Vietnam through a supplier. At the moment, its Vietnam output is exported. Fluence and Siemens did not reply to requests for comment. AES did not comment.",

Fed Chair Jerome Powell remained equivocal about whether there was one more policy rate rise left this year and said Fed staff were no longer forecasting a recession - but futures markets continue to see a less than 50% chance of another move. Treasury yields and the dollar (.DXY)New Tab eased overnight. The Commerce Department's snapshot of gross domestic product due on Thursday is expected to show the U.S. economy grew at a trend rate of 1.8% in second-quarter, almost a full point drop in core inflation to 4% and the housing slump nearing an end. The stock market remains buoyed near highs for the year. Aided by upbeat Boeing results, the Dow Jones blue chip index (.DJI)New Tab clocked 13 straight daily gains on Wednesday for the first time since 1987 and S&P500 futures are up again ahead of today's bell. The VIX (.VIX)New Tab volatility gauge slipped below 13 for the first time this month. But Meta Platforms (META.O)New Tab stole the show overnight, with its stock soaring 7% after the digital giant reported a strong rise in advertising revenue - while topping Wall Street financial targets and third-quarter revenue guidance. Global stocks (.MIWD00000PUS)New Tab hit their highest since April last year on Thursday, with European stocks up more than 1% ahead of the ECB decision. While the ECB is also expected to deliver a quarter-point hike to 3.75%, money markets similarly doubt there's another rate rise left in the campaign - wary of a euro zone economy that's slipping in and out of recession this year as disinflation progresses. The euro pushed higher against a softer dollar ahead of the announcement and press conference from ECB chief Christine Lagarde. The yen also firmed as the Bank of Japan is expected to keep its easy policy unchanged on Friday. The rest of the news was dominated by the screed of earnings hitting the headlines. Shares in oil giants Shell (SHEL.L)New Tab and TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA)New Tab fell after they both missed forecasts in reporting big profit drops for the second quarter - the result of the sharp oil price recoil over the last year. Barclays (BARC.L)New Tab was again an outlier in banking. Its shares dived 7% despite plans for a hefty buyback after the British lender warned of growing pressure on its UK business and missed forecasts for its investment bank as a global corporate dealmaking slump persists. The euro zone's biggest bank BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA)New Tab , by contrast, beat Q2 estimates and the stock jumped 4%. In Asia, Hong Kong shares (.HSI)New Tab rose in line with world markets, but mainland China indices continue to stumble under a cloud. China's industrial profits extended this year's double-digit pace of declines into a sixth month, falling almost 17% for the year through June. Events to watch for on Thursday: * European Central Bank policy decision, followed by press conference from President Christine Lagarde * U.S. corp earnings: Intel, Ford, McDonald's, Abbvie, Boston Scientific, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Honeywell, Xcel, Eastman Chemical, Pentair, Mastercard, S&P Global, Hershey, PG&E, Digital Realty, Northrop Grumman, Weyerhaeuser, Edison, Principal Financial, Cincinatti Financial, Verisign, Comcast, Southwest Airlines, HCA, Willis Towers Watson * U.S. Q2 gross domestic product, weekly jobless claims, June durable goods orders, June pending home sales, June wholesale/retail inventories, Kansas City July business surveys * U.S. Federal Reserve Board holds open meeting to discuss proposed rules to implement the Basel III banking agreement * U.S. Treasury auctions 7-year notes, 4-week bills * Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni meets U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington (This story has been corrected to show Thursday's updates, not Friday's, in the corporate earnings diary and delete references to Exxon and Chevron results)",

By the same token, as the economy heads for its first real recession in over a decade, there’s value in having employees who have seen it all before. To firms keen to avoid repeating past mistakes, the graying of the Western workforce may not be a bad thing in 2023. It’s no secret that the labor supply is getting older. More than 180,000 Americans will turn 65 each month in 2023, the highest on recordNew Tab , according to a study from the St. Louis Federal Reserve. People are working longer, too. The share of European over-55s in jobs grew to 20% in 2019, from 12% in 2014, according to official dataNew Tab . Retailer Target (TGT.N)New Tab scrapped its mandatory retirement age of 65 in September; Boeing (BA.N)New Tab raised its maximum age to 70 in 2021. Chief executives too are more senior than they were. The typical incoming CEO is 55, a decade older than the average in 2005, according to Crist Kolder Associates. Walt Disney (DIS.N)New Tab and Starbucks (SBUX.O)New Tab brought back retired bosses Bob Iger and Howard Schultz in 2022, aged 69 and 71 respectively. Bank of America (BAC.N)New Tab chief Brian Moynihan says he hopes to keep running the giant U.S. lender until 2030New Tab , by which time he will be 70 and will have held the role for 20 years. There’s a fine line between prizing expertise and entrenching boomer privilege. But fresh-faced innovators made a particularly poor showing in 2022. The poster child for exuberance over experience is likely to be 30-year-old Sam Bankman-Fried, whose cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapsed in spectacular fashion in November, leaving billions of dollars of customers’ money unaccounted for and financial backers like Sequoia Capital in the doghouse. Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison, while Meta Platforms (META.O)New Tab , run by fellow millennial Mark Zuckerberg, burned more than $582 billion of shareholder value. In 2023, experience ought to be at a premium as low inflation and bull markets end. Money markets are pricing in U.S. rates of 5% by the summer. Last time they hit that level in 2007, fintech wasn’t a word, and one-third of today’s U.S. workforce was 19 or younger. Wall Street firms may therefore temper their appetite for digital natives, and bosses will find shareholders more tolerant of long tenure. The flip side is that as the market turns, youthful entrepreneurs may find themselves shunned, at least for a while.

In an interview on the sidelines of the Singapore Airshow, GallopAir CEO Cham Chi said COMAC was exploring setting up maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities in Brunei as it seeks more international customers for home-grown planes competing with the dominant Western manufacturers Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab . COMAC declined to be interviewed by Reuters. GallopAir, backed by Chinese investors, currently has no aircraft. However it last year placed the first overseas order for COMAC's C919 narrow-body airliner and the second foreign order for the Chinese planemaker's smaller and older ARJ21 regional jet. The only C919s currently in operation are four with China Eastern Airlines (600115.SS)New Tab . Outside China, Indonesian low-cost carrier TransNusa operates two ARJ21 aircraft. \"When we started negotiating with COMAC they said if a customer can order more than 30 aircraft we can configure to put MRO in the customer country,\" Chi said. The aviation industry has been watching with curiosity whether a country outside China will allow operations by the single-aisle C919. The C919's design - a 158-192 seat challenger to Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX 8 models - is only certified in China. Chi said his airline was working with COMAC and Brunei's civil air regulator to get the air operator certificate and type certificate approval needed for GallopAir to start operating the ARJ21 jet out of the tiny country that shares the island of Borneo with Malaysia and Indonesia. But starting a regulatory approvals process for the C919 was at least two to three years away, Chi said, adding he wanted to see more flying hours from the plane before GallopAir takes deliveries. Chi said GallopAir was working with COMAC's customer service arm to source COMAC-trained staff required by Brunei authorities for the approvals process. China-based Shaanxi Tianju Investment Group is an investor in GallopAir, which will be only the second Brunei-based airline operator after national carrier Royal Brunei Airlines. GallopAir has said it intends to provide flight services in the Brunei Darussalam–Indonesia–Malaysia–Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) and act as a feeder for Royal Brunei.",

El Al, Israel's flag carrier, said it lost $66 million in the first three months of 2022, versus a loss of $86 million a year earlier. Revenue more than doubled to $283 million, though a sharp rise in expenses offset most of the gain, it added. Shares in the airline were down 2.7% at 0856 GMT in Tel Aviv. Sales had plummeted at El Al amid restrictions imposed during the pandemic to curb the spread of COVID-19, but borders were fully opened in March. Its load factor rose to 73% in the quarter from 53% in the January to March period of 2021. El Al, which has a 22% market share at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, estimated that sales in May reached $267 million, up 10% from May 2019 levels. In recent weeks El Al, which has an all-Boeing (BA.N)New Tab fleet of 45 aircraft, has had to cancel a number of flights due to staffing issues. \"The return to routine is hitting all airlines in the world, which are experiencing high demand and being forced to fill qualifications and manpower gaps,\" said incoming chief executive Dina Ben Tal. She noted that El Al, which was forced to lay off one-third of its staff as part of a government bailout package, will train new employees and return to a full fleet of aircraft gradually. \"We have a lot of work to do on this matter,\" said Ben Tal, who is succeeding Avigal Soreq. El Al also said it remained in negotiations with insurer Phoenix Group (PHOE1.TA)New Tab for a $130 million loan, with talks expected to be completed by the end of June. read more",

            "text": "once a hot favourite date for a first rate cut - this is not the outcome the bond market bargained for at the turn of the year. A second U.S. inflation disappointment in the space of a week, the biggest annual oil price gains since 2022 and a very real chance the Bank of Japan ends its long-standing negative interest rate policy as soon as Tuesday all took a toll on Treasuries over the past 24 hours. With futures now doubting a rate cut will come at all in the first half of the year - and more than 50 basis points lopped off expectations for the whole easing cycle since January - Treasury yields surged again on Thursday. Markets are now expected less than half the 2024 rate cuts they saw eight weeks ago. Both 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields , jumped more than 10bp each after stickiness seen in February's consumer prices earlier in the week was matched by equally stubborn producer prices for the month - while supply concerns accelerated year-on-year oil prices close to 20% and crude hit its highest for the year. In price terms, two-year Treasuries are now negative for the year, while 10-year notes are down 7%. With the whole Fed horizon being revised higher, the dollar (.DXY)New Tab has rebounded to best levels in over a week. Friday saw some calming as yields and oil prices fell back a touch. To be sure, there were plenty of caveats around the latest sweep of data. Although both above forecast, annual headline and core PPI numbers are still 2% or less, last month's retail sales rebound was less than expected and industry output readings are expected to be flat for the month when released later today. But it makes for an uncomfortable backdrop going into next week's central bank meetings nonetheless. And the rumble in rates was enough to sideswipe stocks again too - with small cap indexes (.RUT)New Tab taking the brunt with losses of almost 2% on Thursday. Against all that, relatively modest 0.3% losses in the S&P500 (.SPX)New Tab and Nasdaq (.IXIC)New Tab were impressive and futures were steady early Friday. That said, the equal-weighted S&P500 (.EWGSPC)New Tab did lose almost 1% and AI-leader Nvidia (.NVDA.O)New Tab dropped 3%. And the ongoing swoon in Tesla (TSLA.O)New Tab continued to alarm as the electric vehicle giant's losses for the year to date hit 35% - knocking some $250 billion from its market value as it dropped another 4% on Thursday. Dogged by sluggish EV demand in the first quarter, a price war and intense competition from China peers - not to mention a German arson shutdown in one of its factories and noise around chief executive Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package - the stock losses are mounting. Tesla has replaced Boeing as the worst performing stock on the S&P 500 index so far this year. Ten out of 48 brokerages rate the stock \"sell\" or \"strong sell\", according to LSEG data. Elsewhere, Bitcoin eased to a one-week low in volatile trade, as investors took profit from its run to a record high after the upside U.S. inflation surprise. It fell more than 5% in the Asian session to at low at $66,629. In Japan, speculation about a BOJ policy tightening next week intensified and dragged the Nikkei (.N225)New Tab lower again. Japan's biggest companies agreed to hike wages by 5.28% for 2024, the highest in 33 years, the country's largest union group Rengo said on Friday, reinforcing views that the central bank will soon shift away from a decade-long stimulus programme. The yen weakened, however - perhaps as much to do with the dollar's jump on the Fed rethink. European stocks fell back from Thursday's records but were steadier early on Friday. Chinese stocks were more mixed, with Hong Kong's index (.HSI)New Tab falling as property worries continue to jar. China's new home prices dropped for an eighth straight month in February, suggesting the fragile property market is struggling to find a bottom despite a slew of measures to shore up the sector. New home prices fell 1.4% over the year - faster than the 0.7% drop in January and the biggest decline in 13 months.

            "text": "Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab said on Thursday it plans to spin off its venture capital arm, HorizonX, to forge a broader external investment fund, in a deal said by sources to value the unit at several hundred million dollars. Under the deal, AE Industrial Partners (AEI), a specialist private equity firm, will add fresh capital to the portfolio born out of Boeing's decision to set up its own venture fund in 2017. \"The partnership with AEI and future partners broadens our investor base, enables HorizonX to invest at a rapid pace and gives Boeing access to more outside innovation than ever through this investment collaboration,” Boeing Chief Strategy Officer Marc Allen said in a statement. The move accelerates efforts by Boeing to deepen the pipeline of technology available to the U.S. aerospace giant, and will ease the burden of supporting future growth of HorizonX, which has invested in more than a dozen companies. HorizonX \"needs to go faster and needs a bigger capital pile to invest in more companies,\" a person familiar with the deal said. Boeing will remain a strategic investor with a \"significant majority\" stake in the initial fund to be created from the spinoff, which is expected to be named AE HorizonX, the person said. It will continue to hold smaller stakes in any follow-on funds bringing in more entrepreneurial capital. Under the deal, Boeing will contribute the HorizonX portfolio, valued by industry sources at several hundred million dollars. It will also provide a specialist industrial perspective and receive preferential access to innovations developed by portfolio companies. Boeing is among several aerospace groups that have until now sought to keep complete control of efforts to develop technology through in-house venture funds. But analysts have questioned the ability of traditional aerospace firms to provide the increasing amounts of time and capital needed to generate meaningful advances in technologies like robotics and mobility. \"The main question is how you deal with scale,\" an industry source said. Boeing additionally faces pressure on its balance sheet from some $60 billion in debt accumulated as the company grappled with a nearly two-year safety ban of its 737 MAX, compounded by the coronavirus pandemic. Boca Raton, Florida-based AE Industrial Partners manages more than $3 billion of equity capital with a focus on aerospace and defense, according to its website. Boeing launched HorizonX in 2017 as an \"innovation cell focused on accelerating potentially transformative aerospace technologies,\" and at one time said its investments would total tens of millions of dollars per year. Among HorizonX's investments was a $20 million stake in Richard Branson's suborbital tourism venture Virgin Galactic (SPCE.N)New Tab , which flew the billionaire British businessman to the edge of spaceNew Tab last month. Boeing also invested in the now-collapsed hybrid-electric planemaker Zunum Aero. Some industry officials expect more joint ventures and financial partnerships as aerospace companies tackle challenges such as the decarbonization of aviation and a digital revolution in manufacturing.",

The ongoing dialogue facilitates continuous improvement in compliance and aviation safety to ensure that commercial aviation remains the world’s safest form of transportation.\" Dickson's comments came in the face of scrutiny from Congress. Senator Maria Cantwell, the committee chair, disclosed she plans to release a report on aviation whistleblowers by the end of the year. \"Line engineers had early warnings, whether it's the (Boeing) 787 battery issue, or whether it was this issue related to synthetic airspeeds or the complexity of automation and overload of pilots in the system,\" Cantwell said. \"Those line engineers weren't listened to.\" Dickson said the FAA is delegating fewer responsibilities to Boeing for aircraft certification. He told the committee the FAA is \"demanding more transparency\" from manufacturers. The FAA is currently scrutinizing a number of issues involving Boeing airplanes. Boeing agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department in January including $2.5 billion in fines and compensation stemming from the 737 MAX crashes. Congress in December approved legislation boosting FAA oversight of aircraft manufacturers, requiring disclosure of critical safety information and providing new whistleblower protections. Cantwell pressed Dickson on whether the FAA can meet all the reform requirements. \"I'm not going to allow the law to be skirted here. This issue is about whether you're going to follow a process that allows us to see the work of the FAA, see that it's completed,\" Cantwell said. An FAA survey released in August 2020 found some safety employees reported facing \"strong\" external pressure from industry and raised alarms the agency does not always prioritize air safety. Dickson said on Wednesday he has \"made it clear internally that we always do the right thing when it comes to safety — and that I have the workforce’s back on that.\"",

He declined to discus the number of aircraft involved. \"All I will say is that we are looking at buying a number of extra aircraft,\" he said. The Boeing 777X is a planned family of two large twin-engined aircraft including the 400-seat 777-9 and smaller 777-8. Its entry to service has been delayed by around five years amid certification and engine development issues. Emirates reduced its order for 150 777X to 126 jets as part of a deal that saw the airline order 30 787 Dreamliners in 2019. Speaking in Istanbul on Tuesday, Clark said he was \"perhaps a little more confident\" in Boeing's ability to get the new aircraft out, adding he expected to receive the first aircraft in the last quarter of 2025. Boeing officials said at a media briefing last week that the 777X was on track to be certified and delivered in 2025. Emirates Group last month posted record 2022-23 profit of 10.9 billion dirhams ($3 billion) and reported a \"full recovery\" from the pandemic. \"The demand for our services continues to outpace our ability to get the capacity in place,\" Clark said on Tuesday. \"The results for the first two months of this year have already exceeded what we did last year.\" Clark also indicated progress on a long-stalled project to expand the terminal at Dubai's second hub, paving the way for Emirates to move operations. \"On the new airport, we are close. I think the government is fairly close to making a decision very soon,\" Clark said. Emirates would prefer the project to be finished by 2032 or 2033, \"so a decade from now, basically,\" he said. The expansion of Dubai’s Al Maktoum International to handle 120 million passengers a year by 2025 has been delayed since around 2018. The airport, which opened to passengers in 2013, aims to be one of the worlds’ biggest but currently only handles a fraction of Dubai’s traffic, with Emirates still at Dubai International.",

Boeing shareholders will vote on the nomination of Sabrina Soussan, chief executive of water and waste management company Suez SA, at its annual meeting on April 18. If elected, she will become the first board member based outside the United States and the eighth independent director to join the board since April 2019. Soussan, who has German and French nationality, would sit on the board’s audit and finance committees, Boeing said. Boeing’s board of directors has weathered several high-profile departures in the wake of the 737 MAX crisis, including those of U.S. Ambassadors Caroline Kennedy and Nikki Haley in January 2021 and March 2020, respectively. As head of Suez, Soussan runs an emblematic French company that built the Suez Canal and went on to manage much of the country's water supply. She became CEO of Suez in July 2022, about a year after the company was swallowed by rival Veolia(VIE.PA)New Tab following a rare and much-publicized hostile takeover bid in her native city of Paris. Boeing Chair Larry Kellner praised Sousson's \"extensive engineering and senior leadership experience\" in areas such as manufacturing, safety and sustainability. Picking a European utility boss with a background in ground transportation and building technologies, having started at carmaker Renault (RENA.PA)New Tab , is expected to help Boeing shape its response to pressure to decarbonize, led by European regulators. The appointment comes weeks after Soussan set out a set of sustainability goals including lowering Suez's emissions from water activities by 39% by 2030. Suez has also said it is working with Boeing's European rival Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and others to set up an ecosystem for Sustainable Aviation Fuel in France. Soussan may also bring an alternative perspective to topics like autonomy, which Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun identified earlier this year as a key technology for the future, telling Bloomberg TV that it would \"come to all of the airplanes eventually.\" In 2018, as head of train maker Siemens Mobility (SIEGn.DE)New Tab , Soussan wrote on LinkedIn that technology would support humans in making transportation safer and more secure, adding: \"But please note: I did not say REPLACE humans but SUPPORT humans\".",

            "text": "Middle East airlines are gearing up for increased competition after Dubai carriers went on an order spree at the region's largest air show, watched by potential rivals teasing their own deals. As widebody jet orders worth $67 billion at list prices tumbled out of the Dubai Airshow, Saudi and Turkish national carriers were finalising blockbuster orders from the sidelines. \"You can't get a better geographic location than the Middle East, connecting 80% of the world's population within an 8-hour flight,\" said Darren Hulst, vice-president of commercial marketing at planemaker Boeing (BA.N)New Tab , which beat Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab on orders. Dubai International airport aims to boost capacity to 120 million passengers a year by 2026, up from 100 million today. Saudi Arabia plans to increase its international routes from 99 to over 250 and more than triple annual passenger traffic to 330 million by 2030 from 109 million in 2019. The kingdom is spending heavily to transform its aviation sector, moving ahead with plans for a new national airline and massive airport in Riyadh to boost connectivity. The state-led drive to expand Saudi's aviation sector comes amid simmering economic regional rivalry between the kingdom and the UAE. But while Saudi's state-backed start-up Riyadh Air positioned an exhibition in vivid livery on the main concourse, the country's carriers held back from placing firm orders. Turkish Airlines (THYAO.IS)New Tab meanwhile, an established player in the lucrative transit market, previewed an order for over 350 planes on the eve of the show. Airbus said there was agreement in principle but sources said nothing formal had been signed. A senior executive at a Gulf airline said the emergence of Riyadh Air would be a challenge for the Middle East's biggest airlines Emirates (EMIRA.UL) and Qatar Airways, which dominate the lucrative transit passenger market. Both have made Dubai and Doha hubs for international travel. Dubai has seen a rise in point-to-point traffic following the end of the pandemic and is expecting 86.8 million passengers this year at Dubai International. \"Dubai is really emerging well in the post-pandemic era on many fronts. Dubai's outlook as an aviation hub is very bright despite the current challenges and uncertainties,\" said aviation analyst Brendan Sobie. Dubai Airports Chief Executive Paul Griffiths has overseen an expansion of Emirates' Dubai hub into one of the world's busiest airports since joining in 2007. \"The worst thing about being number one is that you get complacent,\" he said. \"But you have to realise that you always have a target on your back and your competitors are aiming for you.\" Griffiths described Saudi Arabia's plans as \"ambitious\". State-owned Saudia Group, which owns national carrier Saudi Arabian Airlines and budget carrier flyadeal, said it is ready to sign an order for more than 150 narrow-body jets. The kingdom has also announced a new airport in Riyadh that could handle 120 million passengers a year by 2030. \"Maybe the competition will be difficult for others because we have already started to build our infrastructure,\" said Saudia Group's general manager of communications and media affairs, Abdullah Al Shahrani. Aviation consultant John Strickland, citing the kingdom's domestic population of around 35 million, said there was space for another large Gulf airline based in Saudi Arabia. \"There is enough pie for both operations,\" he said. Saudia and Riyadh Air earlier this year ordered 78 Boeing 787s. Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas told Reuters this week it expected to place a \"sizeable order\" of narrow-bodies in coming weeks. Douglas, hired from Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways, insists Riyadh Air's business model is different to that of Emirates and Qatar Airways. \"We all understand that the biggest part of their business is transfer traffic and nearly all of our business is point to point,\" he said. Riyadh Air, owned by the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, displayed a royal purple wide-body jet at this week's airshow, ahead of launching operations in 2025. A key target audience is travelers visiting Saudi Arabia and sources told Reuters the new airline also plans to carry people from one country to another via the kingdom, emulating the major Gulf carriers.",

            "text": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday set out ambitions to more than triple annual defence exports to $5 billion over the next two years, as arms firms flocked to a major air show for a slice of the nation's massive import budget. The country is looking to sign defence deals worth 750 billion rupeesNew Tab ($9 billion) at the biennial five-day Aero India event, its biggest ever, as its airlines try to complete jetliner purchases to meet civilian demand and press global aircraft manufacturers to produce more locally, mainly through partnerships. India has been one of the world's biggest importers of defence equipment for decades, but it has punched below its weight in the global arms export market. New Delhi's export ambitions are a sign of its growing clout as it uses the leverage of huge imports to attract investment in its domestic industry. \"Today, India is not just a market for defence companies, it is also a potential defence partner,\" Modi said in a speech at the show. \"I call on India's private sector to invest more and more in the country's defence sector.\" India exports defence products to 75 countries, he added. Past Indian exports include Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) (HIAE.NS)New Tab Dhruv helicopters to the Philippines, Mauritius and Ecuador and Russia-India venture BrahMos Aerospace's supersonic cruise missiles to the Philippines. HAL has also offered its Tejas light fighter jet for sale to Malaysia. India has also exported other items such as offshore patrol vessels, coastal surveillance systems, avionics, chaff rocket launchers and spares for radars. The air show aims to promote exports of indigenous air platforms such as Tejas, Dhruv, HTT-40 training aircraft, Dornier light utility helicopter and the light combat helicopter. India also wants smaller domestic companies and start-ups to make parts for large defence products globally as well as to attract foreign investment for joint product development and production. Defence experts were circumspect about India's ambition. \"From just a 0.2% share in global arms exports, becoming a major exporter is a long haul,\" said Amit Cowshish, a former financial advisor in the Defence ministry and a former distinguished fellow at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses in New Delhi. \"Some of the biggest importing countries, even if they are willing, will find it difficult to withstand pressures from Europe and the U.S. to consider buying whatever little we have to offer by way of major equipment and platforms,\" Cowshish said. At the Aero India event, held at the Air Force Station of Yelahanka near Bengaluru, officials cheered aerobatic displays by aircraft including Tejas and Russian-made Sukhoi 30 fighter jets. Sharing borders with nuclear-armed rivals China and Pakistan, India's largely Soviet-era air force fleet is in desperate need of modernising. Russia supplied India with around $13 billion of arms in the past five years, Russian state news agencies reported late on Sunday, and suppliers in the European Union and the United States have been lobbying for a bigger share of the market. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has made it imperative for India to further diversify its supply base, amid fears of possible Russian supply disruption and Western pressure on New Delhi to limit ties with Moscow. Exhibitors at the show include Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab , Boeing (BA.N)New Tab , Dassault Aviation (AM.PA)New Tab , Lockheed Martin (LMT.N)New Tab , Israel Aerospace Industry, BrahMos, SAAB (SAABb.ST)New Tab , Rolls Royce, Larsen & Toubro (LART.NS)New Tab , HAL and Bharat Electronics Ltd (BAJE.NS)New Tab . India's airlines are also expanding, with Tata Group's Air India expected to announce a potentially record deal to buy nearly 500 jets from Airbus and Boeing, worth more than $100 billion at list prices. Although unlikely to be announced at the air show itself, the deal coincides with India's largest industry gathering where suppliers hope to win spin-off contracts from the country's defence and civil aviation expansion.

            "text": "Germany will use a 100 billion euro special fund set up for its military to buy encrypted radios, new frigates and corvettes and a short range air defence system, according to a draft seen by Reuters and a defence source. The draft gives a broad sketch of how the German government aims to spend the fund announced by Chancellor Olaf Scholz days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in what he called a \"Zeitenwende\", or turning point. It was a major policy shift after decades of military restraint that were rooted partly in Germany's bloody 20th-century history and resulting pacifism. Hours after Moscow launched what it calls a \"special military operation\" on Feb. 24, the chief of the German army said his troops were starkly ill-equipped for military action and that he was \"fed up\" with Germany's neglect of the military. With the 100 billion euro fund, Scholz aims to bring the Bundeswehr's weapons and equipment back up to standard after decades of attrition following the end of the Cold War. Some 20.7 billion euros of the fund will be earmarked to modernize the military's command and control systems alone, the document said, including the acquisition of encrypted radios, integration into the vehicles and the roll-out of a battle management system. In the past, German troops have borrowed encrypted radios from forces they cooperated with in places such as Mali in order not to jeopardize joint operations. Berlin will also buy five more corvettes of the K-130 type, according to the defence source, likely to replace an older batch of these ships, and trigger an option to purchase two more F-126 frigates. The German shipyard Luerssen was the main contractor for the latest batch of corvettes, whereas the frigate is produced by the Dutch Damen shipyard in cooperation with Blohm + Voss. The draft also lists the acquisition of an air defence system, which the source specified as a ground-based short and medium range air defence as well as a drone protection system. This kind of air defence, which is in very short supply with the German military, is used to protect troops while they are vulnerable on the way into and during a deployment close to the frontlines. The military will also get more Boeing (BA.N)New Tab P-8A maritime patrol aircraft, according to the source, and more and more heavily armed light utility helicopters. The Bundeswehr is flying the H145M helicopter built by Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab , and arming this model more heavily will bring it closer to the capabilities of an attack helicopter. The lion's share of the special funds, with some 40 billion euros, will be spent on air capabilities, as Reuters reported in April. read more The list also includes projects already announced, such as the planned purchase of Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jet and the development of an electronic warfare capability for Airbus' Eurofighter, including the purchase of additional Eurofighters for this role.",

            "text": "Lockbit, a notorious cybercrime gang that holds its victims' data to ransom, has been disrupted in a rare international law enforcement operation, the gang and U.S. and UK authorities said on Monday. The operation was run by Britain’s National Crime Agency, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Europol and a coalition of international police agencies, according to a post on the gang’s extortion website. \"This site is now under the control of the National Crime Agency of the UK, working in close cooperation with the FBI and the international law enforcement task force, ‘Operation Cronos’,\" the post said. An NCA spokesperson and a U.S. Department of Justice spokesperson confirmed that the agencies had disrupted the gang and said the operation was \"ongoing and developing\". Officials in the United States, where Lockbit has hit more than 1,700 organisations in nearly every industry from financial services and food to schools, transportation and government departments, have described the group as the world’s top ransomware threat. A representative for Lockbit did not respond to messages from Reuters seeking comment but did post messages on an encrypted messaging app saying it had backup servers not affected by the law enforcement action. The FBI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The post named other international police organisations from France, Japan, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland and Germany. Lockbit and its affiliates have hacked some of the world’s largest organisations in recent months. The gang makes money by stealing sensitive data and threatening to leak it if victims fail to pay an extortionate ransom. Its affiliates are like-minded criminal groups that Lockbit recruits to wage attacks using its digital extortion tools. Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts data. Lockbit makes money by coercing its targets into paying ransom to decrypt or unlock that data with a digital key. Lockbit was discovered in 2020 when its eponymous malicious software was found on Russian-language cybercrime forums, leading some security analysts to believe the gang is based in Russia. The gang has not professed support for any government, however, and no government has formally attributed it to a nation-state. On its now-defunct darkweb site, the group said it was \"located in the Netherlands, completely apolitical and only interested in money\". \"They are the Walmart of ransomware groups, they run it like a business – that’s what makes them different,\" said Jon DiMaggio, chief security strategist at Analyst1, a U.S.-based cybersecurity firm. \"They are arguably the biggest ransomware crew today.\" In November last year, Lockbit published internal data from Boeing (BA.N)New Tab , one of the world's largest defence and space contractors. In early 2023, Britain’s Royal Mail faced severe disruption after an attack by the group. According to vx-underground, a cybersecurity research website, Lockbit said in a statement in Russian and shared on Tox, an encrypted messaging app, that the FBI hit its servers that run on the programming language PHP. The statement, which Reuters could not verify independently, added that it has backup servers without PHP that \"are not touched\". On X, formerly known as Twitter, vx-underground shared screenshots showing the control panel used by Lockbit's affiliates to launch attacks had been replaced with a message from law enforcement: \"We have source code, details of the victims you have attacked, the amount of money extorted, the data stolen, chats, and much, much more\", it said. \"We may be in touch with you very soon\" it added. \"Have a nice day\". Before it was taken down, Lockbit's website displayed an ever-growing gallery of victim organisations that was updated nearly daily. Next to their names were digital clocks that showed the number of days left to the deadline given to each organisation to provide ransom payment. On Monday, Lockbit’s site displayed a similar countdown, but from the law enforcement agencies who hacked the hackers: \"Return here for more information at: 11:30 GMT on Tuesday 20th Feb.,\" the post said. Don Smith, vice president of Secureworks, an arm of Dell Technologies (DELL.N)New Tab , said Lockbit was the most prolific and dominant ransomware operator in a highly competitive underground market. \"To put today’s takedown into context, based on leak site data, Lockbit had a 25% share of the ransomware market. Their nearest rival was Blackcat at around 8.5%, and after that it really starts to fragment,\" Smith said. \"Lockbit dwarfed all other groups and today’s action is highly significant.\"",

The Irish-based lessor, which now owns, manages or has orders in place for close to 1,000 planes, also reported a 75% increase in first half profit to $236 million.

Al Baker will be succeeded by Badr Mohammed Al Meer, currently chief operating officer of Hamad International Airport, the source familiar with the matter said. Al Baker's resignation was announced to staff in an official circular, seen by Reuters, from Chairman Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi who paid tribute to his \"27 years of remarkable service\". Qatar Airways could not immediately be reached for comment. Al Baker was appointed CEO in 1997, three years after the airline's launch, and has been instrumental in transforming Qatar Airways into a major international carrier that competes against the likes of Dubai's Emirates and Turkish Airlines. He also became synonymous with a shift in the global aviation map towards the Gulf, as carriers swept up passengers transiting between East and West, and regularly clashed with U.S. and European airline chiefs on trade and labour issues. Al Baker frequently made headlines by goading Western plane giants Airbus and Boeing over their strategies, or factory workmanship, and led the airline during a bitter recent dispute with Airbus over damage to the surface of A350 aircraft. Airbus and Qatar Airways settled at the end of January, averting a rare and potentially damaging UK court trial in the jet sector. Speaking earlier this year in Berlin, Al Baker called the settlement a \"win-win\". He also became a public voice for Qatar during a diplomatic boycott by neighbouring Arab states in 2017-2021, and pushed a strategy of keeping routes open during the pandemic to bolster the presence of the national brand on the world stage. At times, his habit of making off-the-cuff remarks garnered criticism and would subsequently require him to apologise, such as in 2018 when he said a woman would not able to do his job. Al Baker's retirement was first reported on X, formerly known as Twitter, by aviation analyst Alex Macheras. The move came after it was announced on Sunday that Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamid Al Thani had replaced Al Baker as the country's top tourism official. No reason was given for the decision. It was not immediately clear whether Al Baker was retiring from other posts, which include serving as the chief executive of Hamad International Airport and of Qatar Duty Free.",

            "text": "A major defence expo kicked off in the United Arab Emirates on Monday with Russian firms participating in the maritime section despite Western pressure on Gulf states to help isolate Moscow and a strong showing by Israeli companies. Russian firms, including Kalashnikov and Rosoboronexport, displayed assault rifles, missiles and drones at the Naval Defence & Maritime Security Exhibition (NAVDEX), part of the biennial International Defence Exhibition (IDEX) event. Men in traditional Emirati garb known as thobe, as well as military-uniformed men from India, Pakistan and other states, were seen engaging with Russian firms' delegates. At least three Russians companies approached by Reuters declined to speak. The UAE and Saudi Arabia, which have not adopted Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, have resisted U.S. pressure to break links with Russia, with which they have energy and economic ties. The chief executive of BrahMos Aerospace, an India-Russia joint venture, said the firm was moving forward in talks launched five years ago with the UAE for the firm's supersonic cruise missiles, which can be launched from sea, land and air. \"We are in conversation of course with the UAE and other neighbouring countries,\" Atul D. Rane told Reuters, describing the talks with the UAE as advanced after having slowed during the COVID-19 pandemic. UAE authorities did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Many arms-producing nations vie for influence and contracts from wealthy Gulf Arab countries, especially the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which have moved to diversify their defence partners and want to develop their own industries. The UAE and Bahrain forged ties with Israel in 2020 partly due to a shared concern over Iran, whose missile and drone capabilities are seen as a threat by Gulf Arab states. Israeli firms had a large presence at IDEX, including Iron Dome anti-missile system-maker Rafael. Israel Aerospace Industries held a demonstration of an unmanned vessel with Abu Dhabi Ship Building and Abu Dhabi state-owned defence conglomerate EDGE, the first joint demonstration of military equipment between the two countries. \"Our relation is a very good example of the relations between the nations and the companies. We are complementary, one to each other,\" Oren Gutter, operational adviser to IAI's CEO on naval affairs, told Reuters. Organisers said 65 countries were taking part in IDEX, which runs to Feb. 24, including major U.S. defence conglomerates such as Raytheon Technologies (RTX.N)New Tab , Lockheed Martin (LMT.N)New Tab and Boeing (BA.N)New Tab . The UAE said on Monday it signed deals worth 4.5 billion dirhams ($1.23 billion) with local and international firms, including a 1.5 billion-dirham deal with Indonesian firm PT Pal to procure multi-mission vessels and a 421 million-dirham contract with France's Thales LAS for GM403 radars.($1 = 3.6728 UAE dirham)",

The announcement from the country's second-largest airline comes a day after billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala-backed Akasa Air placed an order for 72 Boeing 737 MAX jets valued at nearly $9 billion at list prices. read more \"Boeing has agreed to provide certain accommodations and settle the outstanding claims related to the grounding of 737 MAX aircraft and its return to service,\" SpiceJet said in a filingNew Tab to the domestic stock exchanges. The settlement will allow the resumption of new aircraft deliveries from SpiceJet's order of 155 MAX aircraft, the airline said, adding that it will also pave the way for inducing \"efficient and younger MAX aircraft\" into its fleet. SpiceJet is Boeing's biggest customer in the South Asian nation for the MAX planes. India's air safety regulator had cleared in August the 737 MAX aircraft to fly after a near two-and-a-half-year regulatory grounding following two fatal crashes in 2019.

State-controlled Aeroflot announced on Dec. 30 that it had bought 10 Boeing 777-300ER long-haul planes it previously leased from an Irish company, which it refused to name. The carrier said the planes have been leased by Aeroflot since 2013 and 2014 and they were leased under a finance lease deal, which means that the lessee receives ownership rights to the asset after paying the entire amount, as opposed to a more typical deal when ownership stays with the lessor. Aeroflot and VEB-Leasing, a part of VEB Group, did not immediately respond to requests for comments. According to the list of Russian aircraft published by flight tracking website FlightRadar24 and to the Bermuda Civil Aviation Authority (BCAA), Aeroflot had been operating 22 Boeing 777s in March last year, 10 of which it owned itself and 10 of which it leased from Russian and Chinese lessors. Aeroflot said in December that it will continue to work on further aircraft buyouts in order to maintain its fleet of foreign-made aircraft. After Moscow started what it calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, the West responded with unprecedented sanctions, banning Western companies from working with Russian airlines, most of which operate Western passenger jets, and forced lessors to cancel contracts with them. To protect domestic flights, Moscow re-registered the aircraft in Russia and refused to allow some of them to leave, stranding almost $10 billion worth of aircraft in Russia. Russian airlines continue to operate many of the jets, but some have struggled to secure replacement parts. Russian airlines have held exploratory talks with at least one major Western leasing firm about using state funds to buy some of the more than 400 aircraft stranded in Russia, according to documents and sources.",

The job has been vacant since March 31 when Steve Dickson, who was nominated to the position by former President Donald Trump in 2019, stepped down about halfway through his five-year term. The official did not confirm a Seattle Times report that the White House is set within days to announce Washington as President Joe Biden's nominee. A spokesperson for Washington referred questions to the White House, which declined to comment. Washington headed the Biden-Harris Transportation Department transition team, and he previously was the CEO of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) from 2015 to 2021. He also was a 24-year veteran of the U.S. Army. The Biden administration tapped Billy Nolen, who in December was named the FAA's associate administrator for aviation safety, to serve as the acting FAA administrator until a nominee is named and confirmed to a five-year term. The next FAA administrator will face questions about the agency's oversight of planemaker Boeing (BA.N)New Tab , including its ongoing review of the 737 MAX 10. Boeing must win certification for the largest variant of the 737 MAX before a new safety standard on cockpit alerts takes effect in December or seek a waiver from a 2020 requirement from Congress.",

The U.S. aviation giant is looking to digital technology to accelerate production of new aircraft, said Susan Doniz, Boeing's chief information officer, at the Reuters Momentum conference in Austin on Tuesday. She cited how Boeing cut the development time of the T-7 trainer jet by 80% to three years as an example of what might be possible for commercial airplanes. Still, Doniz declined to offer a target date for when Boeing will design its next major plane digitally, a goal the company has discussed for years. Boeing has a commercial-order backlog of 4,354 aircraft. Some employees expressed reluctance over tools Boeing offered to help them, too. The company deployed the HoloLens, mixed-reality headsets from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)New Tab , so staff could wire aircraft with manuals before them digitally. The first-generation goggles had trouble with certain lighting conditions, and they were an adjustment for some, she said. \"There's a bit of a learning curve,\" she said. Virtual reality is still nascent. The metaverse, not just a place where Boeing may one day build its planes, is a concept where people can have an avatar in vast virtual lands. There even is discussion about creating \"digital twins\" of the real world -- and its problems, said Morgan McGuire, Roblox's chief scientist. \"There's a lot of things in the real world that are really serious and are really bad,\" McGuire said at the conference. \"I don't want the haves and have nots. I don't want -- what's the digital equivalent of homelessness?\" Roblox's success attracting nearly 60 million daily users to play and build games on its site has not found a match however in Tinder, the Match Group Inc (MTCH.O)New Tab dating app that's taking a wait-and-see approach to the metaverse. \"We aren’t doing anything explicitly in the metaverse today, but we want to be the place you go when you want to meet somebody new, whether that is in the real world or the virtual world,\" Tinder Chief Operating Officer Faye Iosotaluno said at the conference. Part of the challenge may be the technology is rudimentary. In the view of Renji Bijoy, chief executive of the virtual office company Immersed speaking at the Reuters conference Wednesday, \"this is more (like) Windows 95,\" he said.",

            "text": "Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab doubled down on plans to raise jet output across the board next year, with its top executive reminding engine makers of their commitments in the face of \"challenging\" supply chains, as jetliner demand led its third-quarter profit higher. Airbus said adjusted operating earnings rose 21% to 1.013 billion euros ($1.08 billion) and would have been higher but for a 300 million-euro charge on unidentified satellite programmes, said by sources to include commercial telecoms family OneSat. Airbus declined to elaborate on the charge, which came as the planemaker formally announced a restructuring in its Defence & Space division that has been in preparation for several months. It reaffirmed 2023 financial and delivery forecasts and said it would raise the target for A350 jet production to 10 a month in 2026 from a previous goal of nine by end-2025 amid demand for wide-body jets, expected to resurface at next week's Dubai Airshow. The comments came after Air Lease AL.N Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy predicted planemakers would miss targets this year and voiced concern about production flaws at Pratt & Whitney, which have led to a tug of war over engine supplies. Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury stuck to his guns, however. \"I confirm that we will deliver according to our ramp-up plans,\" he said after presenting Wednesday's results. For 2024, Faury gave no sign that Airbus was willing to relax the effort, despite pressure to divert engines from aircraft factories to ease shortages in overloaded repair shops. \"2024 is again about ramp-up,\" he told analysts. Some analysts have said the coming year may bring new supply woes. Faury stressed that both Pratt and competing A320 engine supplier CFM, owned by GE Aerospace (GE.N)New Tab and Safran (SAF.PA)New Tab , had pledged to stick to agreed quantities and cautioned against making too many assumptions about Airbus' own production based on supplier remarks. Referring to Pratt, which has suffered the most widespread problems so far, he said: \"They have commitments that they have reconfirmed to us several times that they intend to stick to.\" Pratt & Whitney parent RTX declined to comment. Chief Operating Officer Chris Calio said in September \"our plan currently is to continue to meet our commitments to Airbus,\" while at the same time trying to send enough spares to airlines. GE last month trimmed a 2023 growth forecast for total CFM LEAP engine deliveries and signalled a slower pace of growth for next year. It has said it is aligned with planemakers on demand. Industry sources said there is little margin for error for Airbus as it is already below planned levels of production for small and medium jets, though there is scope to catch up later. Airbus is producing A320-family jets in the low-50s per month instead of a planned level closer to 58, they said. On the loss-making A220, Airbus reiterated plans to raise output to 14 a month. But it has been forced for now to ask some suppliers to slow down as it builds little more than five a month, compared with a current schedule closer to nine, they said. Airbus declined comment on granular production figures. It reiterated plans to deliver its extended-range A321XLR - part of a key battleground with Boeing - in the second quarter of next year. Faury said it was progressing well towards certification following scrutiny of a fuel tank design. Airbus is also girding itself for what looks set to be hard-nosed negotiations with Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N)New Tab after the aerostructures maker secured a price hike from Boeing (BA.N)New Tab . \"We are working very closely with them in the spirit of supporting them, but we also expect from Spirit to well support Airbus. After all, we are their customer,\" Faury said. Spirit said it had nothing to add to comments by new CEO Patrick Shanahan who said last week that a similar price deal with Airbus was \"an item of utmost urgency\" and should address cost pressures on the A220, for which Spirit builds wings.

            "text": "Aviation doesn’t sound like one of global warming’s most pressing headaches. At just over 900 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, flying contributed only 2.5% of the world’s carbon emissions in 2019. Yet getting these down could prove fiendishly difficult. Last month the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the airline industry body, saidNew Tab it wanted aviation’s net carbon footprint to fall to zero by 2050. That’s as it should be. Its own forecasts assume emissions grow 3% every year, meaning roughly 2 billion tonnes by 2050. Because other sectors are decarbonising rapidly as they move to zero-carbon technologies, aviation’s relative proportion of global emissions will increase. The catch is that cutting from 2 billion tonnes requires solutions that right now are expensive, futuristic, or both. Historically, improvements in jet-engine design have delivered efficiency gains of 1.5%-2% a year. Eking out future technological savings will get harder. But swapping old planes for fuel-efficient ones like Boeing’s (BA.N)New Tab 737 MAX or Airbus’s (AIR.PA)New Tab A320neo will make the global jet fleet up to 25% leaner by 2050, the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) reckons. This cuts projected CO2 output to 1.5 billion tonnes with minimal additional outlay. Thankfully, the world has moved on from the Cold War, when airspace over countries like the Soviet Union was off limits, forcing passenger jets into long detours. That said, there’s still scope for more point-to-point flying, especially in crowded regions like Europe. ICAO reckons such improvements can shave another 10% – or 200 million tonnes – off 2050’s CO2 output. That brings emissions down to 1.3 billion tonnes, again for minimal cost. Still, that’s 1.5 times what Germany belched out in 2019. It’s also where the quick fixes end. The first port of call is biofuel, one of the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) options. The CO2 benefits derive from feedstocks like reused cooking oil or agricultural waste being part of the atmosphere’s existing carbon cycle, rather than fossil fuels that have trapped carbon underground for millions of years. The good news is biokerosene is a near-perfect substitute, requiring minimal engine tweaks. Biofuel blends are already in limited commercial use. By 2023, Rolls-Royce’s (RR.L)New Tab new long-haul engines will be able to run on 100% biokerosene. The bad news is that, overall, they still produce some CO2, reducing emissions by at best 80%. They’re also expensive. At three times the price of normal kerosene, biofuels upend aviation’s economics. In 2019, Europe’s Ryanair (RYA.I)New Tab spent 2.4 billion euros on jet fuel, twice its operating profit. Had Chief Executive Michael O’Leary’s fleet flown entirely on biofuel, the bill would have been 7.2 billion euros, roughly the same as the budget carrier’s revenue. Availability is an even bigger challenge. Airline bosses have rightly red-carded feedstocks like palm oil or soybeans that endanger forests or food security. But there’s only so much old cooking oil lying around, and efforts to get SAF off the ground so far haven’t amounted to much – 100 million litres of annual production. IATA’s roadmap points to that soaring to 450 billion litres, a staggering 4,500-fold increase. That said, a 25% biofuel blend would shave a fifth off CO2 emissions, bringing mid-century CO2 output to just over 1 billion tonnes. But it would add 50% to aviation’s fuel bill. From a pure carbon perspective, biofuel’s chemical cousin e-kerosene scores higher. Its base ingredients are water and CO2 captured from the air. The water is split into oxygen and hydrogen using electricity from renewable sources; the hydrogen is then combined with the CO2 to create a hydrocarbon. Again, price and availability are problematic. With no existing commercial production, it’s hard to say what e-kerosene will cost. But if it was cheaper than biofuels, it would already be in use. And the energy input is colossal. Brussels lobby group Transport & Environment thinks Europe’s 2050 fleet would require 535 terawatt hours of green electricity, 1.6 times Britain’s entire electricity consumption last year. Assuming complete carbon efficiency, adding a 25% e-kerosene blend to the mix would take aviation’s emissions down to 780 million tonnes, but inflate its fuel bill by another third. Unless airlines want to offset that CO2 by planting the equivalent weight in trees, batteries and hydrogen will have to step up. Battery planes are already a thing – Rolls-Royce boasts a 300-mile-an-hour one-seater Spitfire lookalike. Yet batteries’ weight remains problematic. Barring an Elon Musk-style technological breakthrough, electric planes will thus be confined to city- or island-hopping for a few dozen passengers, generating negligible CO2 savings. Hydrogen is theoretically promising, but entails a major rejig of the traditional airframe – in liquid form, it is at minus 253 degrees Celsius and takes up three times the space of kerosene with the same amount of energy. Airbus is bullish about a 100-seater hydrogen-powered jet by 2035. U.S. rival Boeing is not. Even if Airbus is right, to make a difference it would have to replace a significant number of the 25,000 passenger jets currently in circulation. That looks unlikely. The outlook, for airlines, is therefore not encouraging. In the absence of a technical hack, flying demand will have to fall. That may come from sharply higher operating costs feeding through to higher ticket prices. But governments may also feel the need to impose punitive taxes or regulation. As during the pandemic, business travellers can probably make do with remote substitutes, especially given the inevitable telecommunications advances. Barring the advent of an airborne deus ex machina, the days of mass-market leisure aviation look numbered. Follow @edwardcropleyNew Tab on Twitter",

The Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 737-800 jet from Auckland had an in-flight engine shutdown and issued a \"mayday\" call while flying over water an hour from its destination of Sydney, a Qantas spokesperson said in a statement. The mayday signal, which indicates grave and imminent danger, was downgraded to \"Possible Assistance Needed\" before landing, the spokesperson added. All 145 passengers disembarked normally when the plane landed in Sydney around 3.30pm local time (0430 GMT). \"While in-flight engine shutdowns are rare, and would naturally be concerning for passengers, our pilots are trained to manage them safely and aircraft are designed to fly for an extended period on one engine,\" the airline said. Passengers told local media they heard a loud bang mid-flight but had not realised there was a problem until the pilot made an announcement on landing. \"I turned on my phone and my wife had called me 18 times, 'Have you landed, have you landed?'\" an unnamed passenger told reporters at the airport. Qantas said it would share more information once engineers had finished inspecting the aircraft.",

            "text": "Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab is set to win backing from Congress for an extension of a looming deadline imposing a new safety standard for modern cockpit alerts for two new versions of the U.S. plane maker's best-selling 737 MAX aircraft, sources told Reuters. The Chicago-based company has been intensely lobbying for months to convince lawmakers to waive the Dec. 27 deadline that affects its MAX 7 and MAX 10 airplanes that was imposed by Congress in 2020 after two fatal 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Congressional leaders have agreed to attach the extension to a bill to fund U.S. government operations and to require new safety enhancements for existing MAX aircraft proposed by U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, the sources said. That massive spending bill still must be passed in the coming days. Cantwell proposed requiring retrofitting existing MAX airplanes with an \"enhanced angle of attack (AOA) and a means to shut off stall warnings and overspeed alerts, for all MAX aircraft,\" Reuters reported on Nov. 30. Faulty data from a single sensor that erroneously triggered a software function called MCAS to repeatedly activate played critical roles in the fatal 737 MAX crashes. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in 2020 required Boeing to retrofit planes to ensure MCAS could activate only if it received data from two AOA sensors. Boeing declined to comment, but Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Stan Deal said last week the planemaker supported Cantwell's safety retrofit proposal. After Dec. 27, all planes must have modern cockpit alerting systems in order to be certified by the FAA, which could jeopardize the futures of the MAX 7 and 10 or mean significant delays for the new aircrafts’ deployment - unless Congress passes legislation. The alerting requirement does not apply to in-service airplanes previously certified by the FAA. Boeing said in October it expects the 737 MAX 7 to be certified this year or in 2023 and last week Boeing's Deal said he thinks the MAX 10 could receive certification in late 2023 or early 2024. Michael Stumo, whose daughter died in the Ethiopian Airlines MAX crash, criticized the decision to add the provision, noting Congress had held no hearings on Boeing's request to extend the deadline. \"No data, no examination,\" Stumo told Reuters on Monday. \"This is how people die on planes.\" Boeing won key support from aviation unions last week, according to previously unreported letters seen by Reuters. International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers President Robert Martinez told congressional leaders in Dec. 14 letters seen by Reuters that the \"deadline threatens to cancel the MAX-10 and MAX-7 aircraft programs, which would result in devastating impacts on thousands of workers and their communities throughout the U.S., as well as the future of the U.S. aerospace industry.\"",

            "text": "Global airlines agreed on Monday to step up plans to tackle climate change as they face mounting pressure from regulators and environmental groups over the impact of billions of extra passengers expected to take to the skies in coming decades. The International Air Transport Association, which groups 290 airlines, including dozens of state carriers, committed to \"net zero\" carbon emissions by 2050 in a move that ties the sector's climate action to the 2015 Paris accord for the first time. It also accelerates a 12-year-old pledge to halve emissions from 2005 levels by 2050 and involves tackling an extra 300 million tonnes of carbon through measures such as bio-based sustainable aviation fuels or hybrid-electric technology. But the moves sparked a backlash from Chinese airlines, mirroring differences between Beijing and the West over environmental policy weeks ahead of new global talks in Glasgow. China Eastern, one of China's \"big-three\" state carriers and the world's fourth-largest domestic operator, said airlines should recognize specific challenges for developing countries - a thorny and recurring issue in global climate negotiations. IATA Director General Willie Walsh acknowledged the goal would be \"an additional challenge at a very difficult time,\" but appealed for unity. \"For aviation, net zero is a bold, audacious commitment. But it is also a necessity,\" he told IATA's annual meeting. Airlines adopted the target as their leaders gathered for the first time since the COVID-19 crisis, which is piling up an estimated $200 billion of losses between 2020 and 2022. IATA projected a drop in industry losses next year to $11.6 billion from a steeper-than-expected $51.8 billion loss in 2021. read more China briefly overtook the United States as the world's largest domestic aviation market during the pandemic and is expected to regain the top spot by the end of this decade. Under the Paris accord, countries agreed to limit the rise in global temperatures from pre-industrial levels to 2 degrees Celsius and preferably to 1.5 degrees. To do that, scientists say the world needs to cut emissions to net zero by 2050. More than 130 countries have set or are considering a target of reducing emissions to net zero by mid-century, the United Nations says. China aims to be \"carbon neutral\" by 2060. \"Carbon neutral\" involves achieving reductions partly through measures such as offset schemes, transferring reductions to other industries, which critics say delays effective action. \"Net zero\" carbon means reducing emissions and offsetting as a last resort. The aviation industry says it must use offsets heavily at first, pending progress on new fuels and technology. Environmental groups have attacked the reliance on a global industry offset scheme and say the priority should be to ensure that carbon stops reaching the atmosphere in the first place. In total, aviation industry pledges would involve removing or compensating for 21.2 gigatons of emissions over the next 30 years at an expected total cost of $1.6 trillion. \"Big announcements mean nothing if they’re not backed by credible policy,\" said Jo Dardenne, aviation manager at Brussels-based T&E. Airline leaders say they have been under pressure to strengthen targets to keep a seat at the table amid what scientists describe as growing risks posed by climate change. Air travel accounts for about 3% of global emissions. \"There is a change in society going on and airlines are a reflection of their societies,\" KLM Chief Executive Pieter Elbers said. Manufacturers immediately matched the airline pledges as aviation seeks a common front, though planemakers differ on the priorities for reaching the goals, with Airbus placing a higher focus on hydrogen despite skepticism from Boeing. read more The meeting also exposed friction between airlines and governments over ageing air traffic systems, which airlines say cause delays and blunt efforts to tackle emissions. Other disputes resurfaced as Walsh - a former British Airways CEO with a reputation as a bruiser in dealing with unions and suppliers - tore into high airport charges, including what he called London's \"off the charts\" Heathrow.",

The purpose was to test the creation of vortices coming from the wings of the Boeing 747, a NASA spokesperson said via email. According to the AFRC descriptionNew Tab , the study tested different configurations of spoilers to weaken the vortices trailing from aircraft, which could help reduce the gap between plane landings and take-offs, potentially easing air traffic jams. “Vortices are wind trails that are generated by an aircraft in motion, and which can be of such hazardous intensities that they endanger other aircraft, especially small aircraft, in flight. At the time of the test (early 1970s), the increase of large aircraft in the airspace was causing in-flight hazards for general aviation pilots”, NASA’s spokesperson said. The test used twelve smoke generators that could be switched on and off. Referring to the image, the spokesperson said: “At this particular point in the test, there are only six on.” NASA’s spokesperson added that the test was not harmful to people on the ground: “There were no added chemicals in the oil that was burned.

            "text": "As Russia's military continues to pound Ukraine with missiles and other lethal weapons, Western nations have responded in part by targeting Russia's defense industry with sanctions. The latest round came on Tuesday, when the United States issued new sanctions on some arms makers and executives at the heart of what it dubbed Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"war machine.\" But a Reuters examination of companies, executives and investors underpinning Russia's defense sector shows a sizable number of players have yet to pay a price: Nearly three dozen leaders of Russian weapons firms and at least 14 defense companies have not been sanctioned by the United States, the European Union or the United Kingdom. In addition, sanctions on Russia's arms makers and tycoons have been applied inconsistently by these NATO allies, with some governments levying penalties and others not, the Reuters review showed. Among the weapons moguls who have not been sanctioned by any of those three authorities is Alan Lushnikov, the largest shareholder of Kalashnikov Concern JSC, the original manufacturer of the well-known AK-47 assault rifle. Lushnikov owns a 75% stake in the firm, according to the most recent business records reviewed by Reuters. The company itself was sanctioned by the United States in 2014, the year Russia invaded and annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. The EU and UK leveled their own sanctions against Kalashnikov Concern this year. The company accounts for 95% of Russia's production of machine guns, sniper rifles, pistols and other handheld firearms, and 98% of its handheld military machine guns, according to its website and most recent annual report. Its weapons include the AK-12 assault rifle, an updated version of the AK-47, some of which have been captured from Russian forces by Ukrainian soldiers. The Kalashnikov Concern also produces missiles that can be fired from aircraft or on land. A former Russian deputy transport minister, Lushnikov once worked for commodities tycoon Gennady Timchenko, a longtime friend of Putin. The United States sanctioned Timchenko in 2014 following Russia’s invasion of Crimea, naming him as a member of the Kremlin’s “inner circle.” Neither Lushnikov, Timchenko or the Kalashnikov Concern responded to requests for comment. It’s the same pattern with Almaz-Antey Concern, a Moscow-based defense company specializing in missiles and anti-aircraft systems. The company has been sanctioned by the United States, EU and UK, but CEO Yan Novikov has not been punished. Almaz-Antey’s website displays the motto “Peaceful Sky is Our Profession.” The company makes Kalibr missiles, which Russia’s Ministry of Defense has credited with destroying Ukrainian military installations. In a statement last month, the ministry said Russia had fired long-range Kalibr missiles at a Ukrainian command post near the village of Shyroka Dacha in eastern Ukraine, killing what the ministry claimed were more than 50 generals and officers of the Ukrainian military. Reuters was unable to independently verify that claim. Neither Almaz-Antey nor CEO Novikov responded to requests for comment. In response to a list of questions submitted by Reuters about Western sanctions aimed at Russia, a Kremlin spokesperson said \"the consistency and logic of imposing sanctions, as well as the legality of imposing such restrictions, is a question that should be put directly to the countries that introduced them.\" The Reuters findings come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that current Western sanctions against Russia “are not enough” as Russian troops make gains in their assault on Ukraine’s eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. The Ukrainian military has been outgunned by Russian artillery in places such as the industrial city of Sievierodonetsk, which it ceded to Russian forces last week after weeks of intense fighting. Putin has portrayed his military’s assault on Ukraine as a “special military operation” aimed at demilitarizing and “denazifying” its democratic neighbor. On Tuesday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry announced it would bar Jill Biden and Ashley Biden, the wife and daughter of U.S. President Joe Biden, from entering Russia indefinitely in what it said was a response to “constantly expanding U.S. sanctions against Russian politicians and public figures.” U.S. National Security advisor Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday that Russia's action was not surprising because \"the Russian capacity for these kinds of cynical moves is basically bottomless.\" The Russian invasion has killed thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, but the exact number is unknown. The United Nations human rights office said, as of Monday, that 4,731 civilians had been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began on Feb. 24, including more than 300 children, with another 5,900 civilians injured in the conflict. The agency said most of the casualties were caused by the use of “explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes,” and that the actual number of dead and wounded was likely far higher. The West has levied sanctions on a swath of Russia’s economy to punish Moscow, an effort that so far has done little to deter the Russian offensive. Like the bans on other Russian firms, sanctions on weapons companies are meant to hamper their ability to sell to foreign customers. These penalties limit their access to imported components and generally make it more costly and time-consuming to produce weaponry. Levying sanctions on the people behind those firms goes a step further to make the pain personal. It allows Western nations to go after any mansions, yachts and other offshore wealth of those who supply Russia’s military, and it limits where they can travel abroad. “You’re demonstrating that being a regime collaborator comes with a cost,” said Max Bergmann, a former State Department official during the Obama administration who worked on U.S. arms transfers and safeguarding U.S. military technology. “They feel it very personally. You’re creating a disgruntled class of people that are tied to the Kremlin,” said Bergmann, now director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based national security think tank. Other companies in Russia’s defense industry identified by Reuters that have not been sanctioned by the United States, EU or UK include the V.A. Degtyarev Plant(ZDEGI.MM)New Tab , a facility 165 miles northeast of Moscow that makes machine guns, anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons that are sold to the Russian military. Its weapons include the Kalashnikov PKM and PKTM machine guns, as well as Kord rifles and machine guns, some of which are mounted on armored vehicles. The Degtyarev Plant did not respond to a request for comment. Also not sanctioned is the Klimovsk Specialized Ammunition Plant, south of Moscow, where “world-famous cartridges” for pistols and Kalashnikov assault rifles are produced, according to an archived version of its website. Neither is the Novosibirsk Cartridge Plant, an ammunition manufacturer that calls itself “one of the leading engineering enterprises of the military-industrial complex of Russia.” Neither ammunition plant responded to requests for comment. Last month, Reuters sought comments from sanctions officials in the UK, EU and United States regarding the news agency’s findings that they had failed to punish a raft of Russian defense firms and tycoons fueling Putin’s war effort. As part of that process, Reuters provided those Western authorities with a detailed list of more than 20 companies and more than three-dozen people that had escaped sanctions. The UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, which levies sanctions for Britain, said it could not comment on future sanctions. It added that London and its allies had levied “the largest and most severe economic sanctions that Russia has ever faced, to help cripple Putin’s war machine.” The European Commission and the U.S. Treasury Department, which handle sanctions for Brussels and Washington respectively, declined to comment on the specifics of Reuters’ findings. Elizabeth Rosenberg, assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes at the Treasury Department, said in a statement that sanctions have “made it harder for Russia to obtain what it needs to procure and produce weapons.” On Tuesday, in conjunction with a meeting of leaders of the G7 nations in the German Alps, the Treasury Department released a new round of defense-related sanctions that included eight of the weapons firms and two of the executives on the list provided earlier by Reuters. One of those newly sanctioned executives, Vladimir Artyakov, has played key roles in Russia’s weapons industry for decades, and serves as the No. 2 executive at Rostec, a military-industrial giant with hundreds of subsidiaries employing more than half a million people, according to its website and annual reports. Artyakov is also the chairman of at least five Russian weapons firms, among them Russian Helicopters JSC, which builds several lines of military helicopters including the Ka-52 \"Alligator,\" some of which have been shot down and documented in Ukraine. He has not been sanctioned by the EU or UK. Artyakov and Russian Helicopters did not respond to requests for comment. Rostec has been sanctioned by Washington since 2014. On Tuesday the United States targeted the company again, levying sanctions on more than 40 Rostec subsidiaries and affiliates. Among those hit was Avtomatika Concern, a company linked to cyber warfare. It was on the list of Russian defense firms that Reuters had submitted to the Treasury Department last month seeking an explanation as to why the companies had not been sanctioned. Rostec and Avtomatika Concern did not respond to requests for comment. Other firms on Reuters’ list that were sanctioned just this week by the Treasury Department include PJSC Tupolev, a maker of fighter jets such as the Tu-22M3 bomber. The Ukrainian military said Tu-22M3 bombers were responsible for a missile strike at a crowded shopping center in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk on Monday, which killed at least 18 people and injured about 60. PJSC Tupolev and another firm on Reuters’ list, JSC VNII Signal, have not been sanctioned by the EU or UK. JSC VNII Signal is a producer of mechanical and navigational systems that power Russian military tanks and some of the country’s most advanced missile systems. PJSC Tupolev and JSC VNII Signal did not respond to requests for comment. Executives at a host of Russian weapons firms, meanwhile, have largely escaped sanctions from Western authorities. Nearly three months after a Tochka-U ballistic missile hit a train station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk on April 8, Russian weapons executives linked to the company that makes those missiles have yet to pay a price. The strike killed more than 50 people, including children, and injured more than 100 others. The Russian firm JSC Research and Production Corporation Konstruktorskoye Byuro Mashynostroyeniya, known as KBM, has been the primary manufacturer of Tochka-U missiles, according to a U.S. Army database of worldwide military equipment. Neither Washington, Brussels or London have sanctioned Sergey Pitikov, KBM’s chief executive. The three Western allies have likewise spared Alexander Denisov, the CEO of NPO High Precision Systems, KBM’s parent company. High Precision Systems oversees production of a wide range of missiles, artillery, grenade launchers and machine guns used by Russian troops and outfitted on military helicopters, aircraft, tanks and warships. Sanctions on Russia’s arms companies and tycoons have been applied inconsistently by the Western allies. The United States and EU have sanctioned High Precision Systems, for example, while the UK has not. The United States has sanctioned KBM, but the EU and UK have not. High Precision Systems, Pitikov and Denisov did not respond to requests for comment. KBM confirmed that Pitikov is its chief executive, but did not respond to additional questions submitted by Reuters. Europe and the United States have failed to coordinate sanctions even on makers of banned weapons. Since the outset of Russia’s invasion in late February, Western governments and human rights groups have decried its use of cluster munitions: small bombs delivered by missiles or rockets, which scatter and explode over an area as large as a city block. A 2008 international treaty bans their use or production under any circumstances because of the devastating effects on civilians. Russia used a Uragan – which translates to “Hurricane” – rocket launcher system to fire cluster bombs in Kharkiv on March 24, killing eight civilians and injuring 15 others, according to the U.N. human rights office and Ukrainian officials. The Uragan is made by JSC Scientific and Production Association Splav, a Russian firm whose systems have been sold abroad to countries including India. The company has been sanctioned by the United States, but not by the UK or EU. Its CEO, Alexander Smirnov, has escaped sanctions altogether. Splav and Smirnov did not respond to requests for comment. It’s much the same for Splav’s parent company, NPK Techmash. The United States and the EU have sanctioned the firm, but the UK has not. Techmash CEO Alexander Kochkin has not been targeted by American or European authorities. Techmash and Kochkin did not respond to requests for comment. In a June 10 statement, the European Commission said there is an effort to align sanctions lists “as much as legally possible” among allies to achieve “the maximum cumulative effect of the sanctions with all our like-minded partners.” In cases where the lists do not align, the Commission statement said, people and companies not currently on the EU’s sanctions list could be added later if there is sufficient evidence. \"Nothing is off the table,\" the statement said. One of the highest-profile Russian firms to escape Western sanctions is VSMPO-Avisma Corp(VSMO.MM)New Tab , which is the world’s largest titanium supplier and 25% owned by Rostec. It supplies Russia’s defense industry, but also counts major Western aerospace companies among its clients. Based in Verkhnyaya Salda, in central Russia, VSMPO-Avisma has subsidiaries with facilities in the United States, Switzerland and the UK, as well as sales and distribution staff in the United States, Europe and Asia, according to its website and annual reports. That’s no doubt a factor that has allowed the company to escape punishment, according to three sanctions and Russian defense experts who spoke with Reuters. VSMPO-Avisma’s vice chairman and majority shareholder, Russian billionaire Mikhail Shelkov, ranked by Forbes this year as Russia’s 59th-richest person, likewise has not been sanctioned. According to past press releases, VSMPO-Avisma has long-term contracts to supply titanium to United Aircraft Corp, a Rostec subsidiary that oversees production of Russian fighter jets such as the Su-34 that have been shot down in Ukraine. United Aircraft has been sanctioned by the United States, EU and UK. VSMPO-Avisma also sells to Europe’s Airbus(AIR.PA)New Tab , and it supplied U.S. aerospace behemoth Boeing Co(BA.N)New Tab up until March, when the Arlington, Virginia-based company said it stopped purchasing titanium from Russia. Boeing had announced just months earlier, in November 2021, that VSMPO-Avisma would be its largest titanium supplier “for current and future Boeing commercial airplanes.” VSMPO-Avisma and shareholder Shelkov declined to comment. Boeing said in a statement that it has worked since 2014 to diversify its sources of titanium around the world, and that its current inventory and sources \"provide sufficient supply for airplane production.\" Airbus did not answer specific questions about its relationship with VSMPO-Avisma. But in an emailed statement it said potential sanctions on Russian titanium “would massively damage the entire aerospace industry in Europe” while doing little to harm Russia because those sales are but a small portion of that nation's overall exports. In 2020, foreign sales accounted for about two-thirds of VSMPO-Avisma’s $1.25 billion in revenue, according to the company’s most recent annual report. That puts Western officials in a tough spot, said Richard Connolly, director of Eastern Advisory Group, a UK consultancy that advises governments and businesses on the Russian economy and its defense industry. Slapping sanctions on VSMPO-Avisma would curtail its lucrative export trade, but it would also force major players in global aviation to switch suppliers or risk sanctions themselves. “That’s the classic sanctions conundrum: If you want to hurt somebody, you’re going to hurt yourself,” Connolly said.",

The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) said an overnight bargaining session had led to the new Boeing offer and workers will vote Wednesday on whether to accept it. Under the new contract offerNew Tab , employees can opt to receive an $8,000 lump sum payment -- minus tax withholdings -- upon ratification or can choose to have the entire amount deposited in a 401(k) plan. The company is dropping its revised 401(k) match proposal. Boeing said in a statement Saturday \"this new offer builds on our previous strong, highly competitive one and directly addresses the issues raised by our employees. We are hopeful they will vote yes on Wednesday.\" Workers at the three plants in Missouri and Illinois build the F-15, F-18, T-7A trainer, and the MQ-25 unmanned refueler. Boeing said on July 24 it was activating a contingency plan in the event of a strike. The standoff began after the union had criticized Boeing's 401(k) payments in the contract and workers rejected the offer. \"Boeing previously took away a pension from our members, and now the company is unwilling to adequately compensate our members' 401(k) plan,\" IAM said on July 24. Boeing's earlier 401(k) offer on Sunday included a company match of workers contributions up to 10% of workers' salaries along with an automatic contribution of 2% for 2023 and 2024. Boeing had also offered a $3,000 ratification bonus. Boeing currently provides a 4% company contribution and a 75% match on the first 8% of an employee contribution.",

We can’t continue the way we are. Boeing really needs to get their act together and get this aircraft sorted.\" Emirates is the world's largest international carrier, according to industry data, and largest user of wide-body jets. \"Don’t forget the aircraft was originally designed for delivery in April 2020; it’s now 2024 if we are lucky. You’ve now got a four-year delay with the programme. If they got another year on it, we are going to question if this is fit for purpose or not, what’s the problem with it?\" A Boeing spokesperson said it \"remains focused on executing the comprehensive series of tests and conditions to demonstrate the safety and reliability of the airplane’s design\". Boeing will continue to work closely with customers, the company said. Emirates is the largest customer for the upgraded version of Boeing's 777 mini-jumbo. The upgrade is facing additional scrutiny and certification delays in the wake of a safety crisis over the 737 MAX. read more The plane is due to be certified in mid-2023 but Clark, who has voiced frustration over delays in the past, told AirlineRatings Boeing had only given a conditional response when he had asked whether that certification date remained on track. He was also reported by AirlineRatings saying Boeing had built 12 of Emirates' 777X and placed them in storage without their engines. Emirates originally ordered 150 of the twin-engined jets in 2013, becoming by far their biggest customer. It later trimmed the order to 115 jets partly by swapping them for 787s, and has previously suggested it could switch more of the order to 787s. However, Clark also criticised a separate issue of production delays of the 787, of which Emirates has 30 on order. \"The total of 30 787s in there look very marginal now as they are so far behind in production,\" he was quoted as saying by AirlineRatings.",

The company has a total of 125,000 U.S. employees. Raytheon, the maker of Tomahawk missiles, last month said it will require all U.S. employees to be fully vaccinated, after the Biden administration mandated immunization for nearly all federal employees and contractors, to widen vaccination coverage in the country. read more Many federal contractors, such as Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab , 3M (MMM.N)New Tab and American Airlines (AAL.O)New Tab , have announced vaccination mandates since. European planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab , which supplies helicopters to the U.S. Army, also joined the list on Tuesday. \"We will require all employees and temporary workers of Airbus in the U.S. to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Dec. 8,\" a company spokesperson said. Other companies such as Gillette maker Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N)New Tab also have mandates in place. To be sure, not every company is facing a pushback from its employees. United Food and Commercial Workers, the union which represents 26,000 workers at Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N)New Tab , said on Tuesday over 96% employees were now vaccinated. While some other large U.S. employers such as Walmart (WMT.N)New Tab were yet to issue broad requirements, the Labor Department's standards will require them to introduce mandates. read more Separately, Raytheon's Hayes said he expects Biden's vaccine mandate to cause \"some disruption\" in the supply chain in a post-earnings conference call. General Electric, another federal contractor that has mandated vaccines, however, said it was too early to say if the decision would have an impact on the U.S. conglomerate's operations. \"We will have a better read as we get closer to the compliance date,\" GE Chief Executive Larry Culp told Reuters.

A national emergency has been declared in Britain for Monday and Tuesday, with temperatures set to rise above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) for the first time. Despite warnings to limit travel, delegates battled crowded trains and shuttle buses to reach the show in southern England. Problems were exacerbated by climate protesters holding a mock funeral for the Earth outside the show. The industry has been reeling from its own travel disruptions and the head of Emirates airline, which has clashed with London's Heathrow over enforced capacity cuts, said a badly disrupted air travel industry would return to equilibrium in 2023 and must \"tough it out\" until then. read more The air show, which alternates with Paris, is the first at Farnborough since 2019, and rising defence spending is in focus amid the war in Ukraine. Britain announced it was collaborating with Japan and existing partner Italy on its next-generation fighter jet programme, potentially leading to decisions on deeper partnerships by the end of the year. read more Three sources told Reuters last week that Britain and Japan were close to agreement to merge their next-generation Tempest and F-X fighter jet programmes to help save costs. read more \"I am a passionate believer in the potential of our burgeoning partnership, not just with Italy, but with Japan,\" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in opening remarks at the show. On the civilian side, Boeing, under pressure to make up ground lost to rival Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab , struck an upbeat tone on aircraft demand despite a faltering global economy. \"I think we'll see the glory of the old days - and then some,\" CEO Dave Calhoun told CNBC, adding he was keeping a close eye on the economy. \"For right now I am enjoying the robust demand that we see.\" Boeing received a boost for its 737 MAX 10 jet, which has hit regulatory snags, with Delta Air Lines (DAL.N)New Tab announcing an order for 100 of the aircraft worth $13.5 billion at list prices, confirming a Reuters report. read more . India's Jet Airways is near a deal to buy 50 A220 jets from Airbus, two people close to the matter said. read more Demand for jets peaked in 2016 but remained buoyant until the pandemic crippled air transport. Now, travel is rebounding, passengers face long lines and some jets are back in demand. But the big-ticket orders that dominated past events are rarer as airlines repair balance sheets weakened by COVID-19 travel restrictions. Aerospace firms came under pressure from customers at the start of the show to stabilise fractured supply chains and feed resurgent jet demand, even as airlines and airports are struggling to smooth their own operations after the pandemic. Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told Flightglobal in an interview published on Monday that engine delays holding back plane deliveries would peak at mid-year. read more But the head of the body representing global airlines, IATA Director General Willie Walsh, said manufacturers had wasted chances to shore up assembly lines. \"Airlines are frustrated by the delays around delivery of aircraft; they're frustrated around issues like access to spare parts,\" Walsh told Reuters. \"I think (manufacturers) should have taken better advantage of the lull in demand over the past two years to have been better prepared for this recovery.\" Industries worldwide are facing gaps in supply chains and labour shortages. Even the Farnborough Airshow itself has had trouble recruiting enough hospitality staff, insiders said. Aviation is also under pressure to build greener planes and stop adding to what Johnson called the \"carbon tea cosy\" heating the planet. \"We know that we must fix it. We know that time is running out,\" he said.",

Boeing's CST-100 Starliner capsule, a gumdrop-shaped astronaut pod, has experienced multiple setbacks in recent years. Software failures in 2019 nixed its debut attempt to dock at the space station. Fuel valve issues last year added nine months of further delays. At 6:54 p.m. EDT (2254 GMT) on Thursday at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Starliner is set to make another attempt at launching to the space station without any astronauts aboard, aiming to provide Boeing a much-needed success as the company strives to climb out of successive crises in its jetliner business and elsewhere in its space and defense unit. \"We wouldn't be here right now if we weren't confident that this would be a successful mission,\" Butch Wilmore, a NASA astronaut likely to fly on Starliner's first crewed flight sometime in the future, told reporters on Wednesday. \"We're ready. This spacecraft is ready.\" \"The teams have been working really hard to get ready for this,\" added Kathy Lueders, NASA's space operations chief, underlining that the Starliner flight is a test mission. \"We learned a lot from the first uncrewed demo (in 2019). We're gonna learn a lot from the second one.\" Last year's valve issues led Boeing to come up with temporary fixes for this week's mission, company officials said on Tuesday, adding that longer-term fixes will be implemented after the mission. The issues have triggered conflict with one of Boeing's key suppliers for Starliner, Reuters reported last week. read more Starliner will attempt to dock to the space station on Friday and spend four to five days attached to the orbital outpost before returning to Earth. If all goes as planned, Starliner could fly its first crew of astronauts in the fall, though NASA officials caution that could get delayed. Butch and NASA astronaut Mike Fincke, two of 44 in NASA's active astronaut corps, had been assigned to the subsequent crewed test flight. But NASA officials, reluctant to tie down two of its astronauts to a flight whose launch date is uncertain, said on Wednesday the mission could carry at least two of a cadre of four astronauts training to test-fly Starliner. Delays and engineering setbacks with Starliner have led Boeing to take $595 million in charges since the capsule's 2019 failure. The spacecraft was developed with a $4.5 billion fixed-price NASA contract in a program that aims, with both Boeing and its rival Elon Musk's SpaceX, to provide the U.S. space agency with two alternate astronaut rides to the space station.",

Revenues soar and losses transform into profits in five-year investment plans, at least on paper. Valuations, too, are carefully calibrated against rivals, some high-flying, others earthbound.

The comparisons to the lofty ambitions at Branson’s other space venture, Virgin Galactic, are an unfortunate by-product. In the arcane world of small-satellite launching, Virgin Orbit has solid claims to uniqueness. Its rockets start their journey from the wings of a cruising Boeing 747, making them greener, cheaper and more versatile than those launched from the ground. And demand for small satellites in low-earth orbits is likely to grow quickly, driven by everything from advances in military and communications technology to the evolution of the internet of things. Morgan Stanley reckons the space economy could be worth $1.1 trillion by 2040. Yet Virgin Orbit is still in its infancy. Its first successful orbital launch was only in January. And this year’s revenue will be a mere $15 million. From there sales will have to grow at 217% every year to hit its $1.6 billion revenue target in 2025. By contrast, $4.3 billion Rocket Lab, its closest rival with 21 successful launches under its belt, is projecting compound annual revenue growth of just 82%, according to projections in Orbit’s presentation. Virgin Orbit is also punchier about its profitability, predicting a 32% EBITDA margin five years’ hence against Rocket Lab’s 22%. For investors who find that too much to stomach, Virgin Orbit can handily point to another space-related venture with even more out-of-this-world projections – 288% annual revenue growth and 47% EBITDA margins. Said outfit is also valued at 13 times 2025’s potential revenue against just 2 times for Virgin Orbit. Awkwardly for Branson, this lofty benchmark is $6 billion Virgin Galactic (SPCE.N)New Tab , the tourism vehicle that recently transported the bearded Brit to the edge of space. In his attempts to launch one venture into the financial stratosphere, Branson may unwittingly help bring another back down to earth. Follow @edwardcropleyNew Tab on Twitter CONTEXT NEWS - Billionaire Richard Branson’s Virgin Orbit is going public via a merger with a blank-cheque vehicle NextGen Acquisition Corp II in a deal that values the satellite-launching business at $3.2 billion. - Virgin Orbit, which was spun off from Branson’s Virgin Galactic space tourism venture in 2017, is expected to receive $483 million of proceeds from the deal with NextGen. - Those proceeds include $100 million from private investors such as aerospace giant Boeing and AE Industrial Partners.",

The Irish airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, committed last year to power 12.5% of its flights with sustainable aviation fuels by 2030, although Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has since said he is not sure Ryanair will reach the \"very ambitious target.\" read more Sustainable jet fuel generally produces up to 70% less carbon than fossil fuels, offering airlines a way to become greener while continuing to fly, before less carbon-intensive hybrid, electric or hydrogen aeroplane options become available from the late 2030s. The budget carrier said on Monday that its order of 210 Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 737 MAX jets, which use around 16% less fuel than the current generation of 737s while squeezing in 4% more passengers, will help it meet 32% of its decarbonisation target. Critics say the low-cost business model encourages people to fly more frequently and drives growth in the total number of people flying. Ryanair plans to grow from flying around 150 million passengers per year before the COVID-19 pandemic to 225 million by 2026, although it predicts that total short-haul capacity in Europe is likely to be lower after the pandemic. Offsetting measures, which Ryanair said will include carbon capture offset projects and supporting government policies and reforms, will contribute a further 24%. One such reform, an overhaul of the European Union's air traffic management agreed by member states last year, will take care of the final 10% of Ryanair's decarbonisation target, the airline estimated.",

In mainland China's deadliest aviation disaster for 28 years, the Boeing 737-800 crashed in the mountains of southern Guangxi on March 21, after a sudden plunge from cruising altitude, killing all 123 passengers and nine crew. read more The pilots did not respond to repeated calls from air traffic controllers and nearby planes during the rapid descent, authorities have said. On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal said flight data from one of the black boxes indicated that someone in the cockpit intentionally crashed the plane, citing people familiar with the preliminary assessment of U.S. officials. One source told Reuters that investigators were looking at whether the crash was a \"voluntary\" act involving crew inputs to the controls, though that does not necessarily mean the dive was intentional. The cockpit voice recorder was damaged during the crash and it is unclear whether investigators have been able to retrieve any information from it. Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab , the maker of the jet, and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) declined to comment and referred questions to Chinese regulators. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), which is leading the investigation, did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Screenshots of the Wall Street Journal story appeared to have been censored both on China's Weibo social media platform and the Wechat messaging app on Wednesday. The hashtag topics \"China Eastern\" and \"China Eastern black boxes\" are banned on Weibo, which cited a breach of laws, and users are unable to share posts on the incident in Wechat groups. In an April 11 response to internet rumors of a deliberate crash, the CAAC said the speculation had \"gravely misled the public\" and \"interfered with the accident investigation work\". On Wednesday, a woman who had lost her husband in the crash, asked to be identified only by her surname, Wen, said she had not seen the Wall Street Journal report but hoped the results of the investigation would be released soon. Wen added that she and other members of victims' families had signed an agreement with China Eastern that included a clause on compensation, but declined to say how much was offered. China Eastern did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Wall Street Journal said the airline had said in a statement that no evidence had emerged that could determine if there were any problems with the aircraft. The 737-800 is a widely flown predecessor to Boeing's 737 MAX but lacks the systems linked to fatal 737-MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 that brought a lengthy grounding of the MAX. China Eastern grounded its entire fleet of 737-800 planes after the crash but resumed flights in mid-April, a decision widely seen at the time as ruling out any immediate new safety concerns over Boeing's most widely used model. In a summary of an unpublished preliminary crash report last month, Chinese investigators did not point to any technical recommendations for the 737-800, which has been in service since 1997 with a strong safety record, according to experts. In a May 10 interview with Reuters, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said board investigators and Boeing had traveled to China to assist the Chinese investigation, which had not found any safety issues requiring urgent action. Homendy said if the board had any safety concerns it would \"issue urgent safety recommendations.\" The NTSB assisted Chinese investigators with the review of black boxes at its U.S. laboratory in Washington at China's request, despite political tension between the countries. CAAC said the NTSB confirmed that it did not release information about the China Eastern crash to media, the state-owned Global Times said. read more Shares of Boeing closed up 6.5%. A final report into the causes of the crash could take two years or more to compile, Chinese officials have said. Analysts blame most crashes on a cocktail of human and technical factors. Deliberate crashes are exceptionally rare globally. In March 2015, a Germanwings co-pilot deliberately flew an Airbus A320 into a French mountainside, killing all 150 on board. French investigators found the 27-year-old was suffering from a suspected \"psychotic depressive episode,\" concealed from his employer. They later called for better mental health guidelines and stronger peer support groups for pilots.",

            "text": "Commercial jets delivered by Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab last year will account on average for emissions equivalent to 1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide each over their 20-year-plus lifespans, a new report from the planemaker shows. Boeing is the latest company to report so-called Scope 3 emissions that result when customers use their products, amid pressure from investors and climate activists for data on how companies are performing on limiting their environmental impact. The report sheds further light on the task facing global aviation as it faces calls by environmental groups for curbs to air travel and growing political pressure to cut emissions, after Europe's Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab issued similar data in February. Together, the world's two largest planemakers in 2020 delivered jets estimated to be responsible for total emissions equivalent to 600 million tonnes of CO2 over their lifetimes, a figure dampened by lower deliveries during the pandemic. Aviation produces up to 3% New Tab of man-made CO2 emissions and 12% of CO2 from transport, the industry says. It has pledged to reduce net carbon emissions to 50% of 2005 levels by 2050, but is moving towards a tougher target of eliminating net emissions. Boeing aims to \"significantly reduce our environmental impact during every stage of a product’s life cycle,\" Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said introducing the Chicago-based company's first-ever sustainability report on Monday. Calhoun reiterated that its jets would fly on 100% sustainable aviation fuels by 2030. Jet engines are currently certified to run on up to 50% of the fuel. In the report, Boeing said commercial airplanes it delivered in 2020 would be responsible for emissions equivalent to 158 million tonnes of CO2, or MtCO2e, over their lifespan. That consists of 136 million tonnes of emissions directly linked to their operation by airlines, and 22 million tonnes related to the production by energy companies of the fuel used in flight. Boeing has said it delivered 157 airplanes in 2020, suggesting each jet will on average generate emissions equating to 866,000 tonnes of CO2 over its lifespan, or 1 million tonnes including indirect emissions linked to fuel production. 'HIGH PRICE TAG' By contrast, Airbus in February said it had delivered 566 jets in 2020 with estimated lifetime emissions of 440 million tonnesNew Tab , including 80 million for fuel production. That equates to lower emissions per airplane compared with Boeing's data, or 636,000 tonnes through direct operations, and 777,000 tonnes including related oil-industry emissions. Experts said comparisons are blurred by different assumptions on the average length of a jet's service. Airbus assumed an average 22-year lifespan for its jets. A Boeing spokesman said it assumed 22.8 years for single-aisle aircraft, 21.5 years for twin-aisles and 29.6 years for freighters. Based on Boeing's 2020 delivery data by type, that suggests a weighted average of 24.8 years, Reuters calculates. Boeing also dominates the market for freighters, which fly longer and had an unusually high share of 2020 deliveries. In 2018, the last year of undisturbed data before Boeing was hit by successive crises over the grounded 737 MAX passenger plane and COVID-19, its emissions per airplane appeared more in line with the trends reported by its rival. For the 806 jets delivered that year, Boeing expects direct lifetime emissions of 560 millions tonnes, or 652 million including fuel production, a spokesperson said. Aerospace firms say they are accelerating global research on new technology and promoting cleaner, alternative fuels. But environmentalist groups insist that flying itself needs to be limited to have a meaningful impact on climate change. \"The data confirms that Boeing’s aircraft come with a high environmental price tag,\" said Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation, an environmental research group based in Washington. Both Boeing and Airbus say their estimates do not include the impact of an expected increase in the use of sustainable aviation fuels, which would cut emissions further. The European Union this month proposed new targetsNew Tab for the fuel.",

The company, which supplies wheel and brake systems for military fighter programmes, said raw material and labour shortages seen in the third quarter were expected to persist into the fourth. A soft defence market is also hurting its business, it said, as customers lowered spending and purchases of parts as they use up stock-piled items from last year. Those issues have clouded a recovery in its civil aerospace division, which saw revenue in the three months to September up 29%, but the reopening of transatlantic travel bodes well for the future, Chief Executive Tony Wood said in a conference call with analysts. Meggitt makes components for aircraft makers such as Boeing (BA.N)New Tab and Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab and is one of many companies struggling with supply chain difficulties as economies reopen from COVID-19 lockdowns.

            "text": "Jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney flagged \"solid progress\" in the aerospace supply chain on Wednesday, addressing a key area of concern for planemakers as they continue to rack up orders at the Paris Airshow. The first two days of the world's biggest air show saw bumper orders from Indian airlines looking to cash in on a rapid rebound in travel since the pandemic and forecasts for continued strong growth in the world's most populous country. In a sign of robust demand elsewhere, industry sources told Reuters on Wednesday that European planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab was also putting the finishing touches to a deal with Mexican low-cost carrier Viva Aerobus for 90 narrowbody jets, though the deal would fall outside the show. But recovery from the pandemic has been more problematic for suppliers, which are still grappling with rising costs, parts shortages and a scarcity of skilled labour. That has raised concerns whether Airbus and arch rival Boeing (BA.N)New Tab will be able to hit ambitious goals to ramp up output in order to meet delivery targets for customers. This week's orders from India alone - for 500 Airbus narrowbody jets from budget carrier IndiGo (INGL.NS)New Tab and a 470-plane deal for both Airbus and Boeing jets finalised by Air India - add almost 1,000 planes to the industry backlog. Pratt & Whitney, a unit of RTX (RTX.N)New Tab - formerly known as Raytheon Technologies, has had a particularly tough time due in part to problems with its GTF engine that have led to the grounding of several planes. The company said on Wednesday the groundings peaked at 10% of the GTF-powered fleet in the first half of this year, and that percentage would trend lower through the rest of the year. The GTF is one of two engine options to power Airbus's top-selling A320neo narrowbody aircraft. Pratt & Whitney President Shane Eddy, who has faced a backlash from airlines over durability problems and a shortage of spare engines, told the air show he was seeing \"solid progress\" in the supply chain. The company has the capacity in place to support maintenance demand but faces shortages of materials, he added. Planemakers also face tight labour markets as they strive to lift production, but Airbus said on Wednesday it had filled more than 7,000 of the 13,000 positions it aims to add this year. The European company, and U.S. rival Boeing, continued to sign new deals at the air show, stoking a debate about whether new fuel-efficient planes will help airlines reduce carbon emissions or whether this will be outweighed by more flights. Aircraft leasing company Avolon signed a memorandum of understanding to order 20 widebody Airbus A330neo aircraft. Boeing, meanwhile, won an order for four 737 MAX jets from India's Akasa Air, confirming an earlier Reuters story, while Luxembourg’s flag carrier Luxair also ordered four 737 MAXs.",

            "text": "The United States has answered President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's plea for rockets that can strike deep behind the front lines of the nearly year-long conflict with Russia. Now Russian forces will need to adapt or face potentially catastrophic losses. The new weapon, the Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB), will allow Ukraine's military to hit targets at twice the distance reachable by the rockets it now fires from the U.S.-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). If included as expected in an upcoming weapons-aid package first reported by Reuters, the 151 km (94 mile) GLSDB will put all of Russia's supply lines in the east of the country within reach, as well as part of Russian-occupied Crimea. This will force Russia to move its supplies even farther from the front lines, making its soldiers more vulnerable and greatly complicating plans for any new offensive. \"This could slow down [a Russian assault] significantly,\" said Andriy Zagorodnyuk, Ukraine's former defence minister. \"Just as HIMARS significantly influenced the course of events, these rockets could influence the course of events even more.\" GLSDB is GPS-guided glide bomb that can manoeuvre to hit hard-to-reach targets such as command centres. Made jointly by SAAB AB (SAABb.ST)New Tab and Boeing Co (BA.N)New Tab , it combines the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) with the M26 rocket motor, both of which are common in U.S. inventories. It is not yet compatible with HIMARS, but the United States will provide Ukraine new launchers for the rockets, said sources. GLSDB could be delivered as early as spring 2023, according to a document reviewed by Reuters. When the United States first sent HIMARS launchers in June, it supplied rockets with a 77 km (48 mile) range. This was a major boost for the Ukrainian military, allowing it to destroy Russian ammunition dumps and weapons storage facilities. Once Ukraine has the new glide bombs, say military experts, Russia will need to push its supplies even farther away. \"We are currently unable to reach Russian military facilities more than 80 kilometres away,\" said Ukrainian military analyst Oleksandr Musiyenko. \"If we can reach them practically all the way to the Russian border, or in occupied Crimea, then of course this will lower the attacking potential of Russian forces.\" Crucially, Ukraine will soon be able to reach every point of the occupied overland route to Crimea via Berdiansk and Melitopol. That will force Russia to redirect its supply trucks to the Crimean bridge, which was badly damaged in an attack in October. \"Russia is using Crimea as a big military base from which it sends reinforcements for its troops on the southern front,\" said Musiyenko. \"If we had a 150km (munition), we could reach that and disrupt the logistical connection with Crimea.\" Beyond the logistical impact, the addition of a longer-range weapon to Ukraine's arsenal could help shake Russian confidence. Tom Karako, a weapons and security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said that while Ukraine would benefit from an even longer range weapon, GLSDB is \"a really important step to give the Ukrainians longer reach and to keep the Russians guessing.\" For the Biden administration, the decision to send GLSDB to Ukraine represents a step toward meeting Ukraine's demand for the 185-mile (297km) range Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missile, which the administration has so far declined to provide, fearing a further escalation of the conflict. The glide bombs, while not as powerful, are much cheaper, smaller and easier to deploy than ATACMS, making them well suited for much of what Ukraine hopes to accomplish: disrupting Russian operations and creating a tactical advantage. Still, said Karako, it is possible the Ukrainians could end up receiving an even longer range weapon in the future. \"Time and again, we've seen the administration say that they would go up to a certain point, but not beyond,\" he said. \"Then, as the situation has deteriorated, they've found the necessity to, in fact, go further.\" This was the case with HIMARS, the Patriot missile defence system, and, just this month, Abrams tanks, all initially off-limits to Ukraine before the administration ended up approving shipments. But for now, the focus will be on how quickly the new glide bombs can arrive in Ukraine, said Zagorodnyuk. \"If they speed it up...this could hugely change the situation on the field of battle.\"",

            "text": "A public spat between the United States and Saudi Arabia will not deter top Wall Street executives and U.S. business leaders from a flagship investment event starting on Tuesday where the kingdom will seek deals to reduce its economy’s reliance on oil. President Joe Biden has vowed \"consequences\" for U.S.-Saudi ties over an OPEC+ decision this month to cut oil output targets, which Riyadh defended as serving market stability. The dispute was the latest shadow to be cast over the annual Future Investment Initiative (FII), which was hit by a Western boycott over the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and by the pandemic in 2020, leaving it a far cry from the 2017 inaugural event that Riyadh billed as \"Davos in the Desert\". FII recovered in 2019 after the uproar over Khashoggi's killing by Saudi agents, drawing big names from financial, defence and energy firms with strategic interests in the world's top oil exporter, but garnered relatively meagre foreign inflows. More than 400 U.S. delegates are expected to attend this week, Richard Attias, CEO of the FII Institute, told Reuters, adding this was the largest representation of a foreign country. This year's edition, running Oct. 25-27, includes JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon, Pimco Vice Chairman John Studzinski and a BNY Mellon executive as speakers, and they still plan to go, spokespeople for the companies told Reuters. Top executives from Goldman Sachs, Blackstone, Bridgewater Associates, Boeing and Franklin Templeton are on the agenda. Goldman Sachs declined comment, while the rest did not respond. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs made nearly $77 million and $42 million respectively in investment banking fees in Saudi Arabia last year, Refinitiv data showed. JPM remains at the top of the league table in 2022 with over $39 million so far. \"For the most part, I do not see U.S. companies actively avoiding Saudi Arabia due to recent political tensions,\" said Adel Hamaizia, managing director at Highbridge Advisory and a visiting fellow at Harvard University. \"U.S. companies will be an important partner to Saudi's investment and growth plans, in traditional sectors, but also in 'newer' fields including tourism, entertainment, EV production, technology and a nascent local defence industry,\" Hamaizia said. The FII is a showcase for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 development plan to wean the economy off oil by creating new industries that also generate jobs for millions of Saudis, and to lure foreign capital and talent. Foreign direct investment still lags behind targets, though there has been movement in new sectors as the kingdom opens up. As Boeing netted an $80 million defence contract last year, Fedex announced a $400 million 10-year investment plan in the country, the Arab world's biggest economy. At 15.3 billion riyals ($4.07 billion), inward FDI for the first half of the year was about a fifth of the $19.3 billion secured in 2021, which had included a $12.4 billion investment for Aramco's oil pipeline infrastructure. It is well below the 2030 target of $100 billion a year under a national strategy aiming for foreign direct investment equalling almost 6% of GDP by 2030. Uncertainty lingers around the regulatory and tax environment as well as high operational costs and lack of a skilled local workforce, even after Riyadh handed companies an ultimatum to locate regional headquarters in the kingdom by 2024 or lose out on lucrative government contracts. \"FDI flows have remained stubbornly flat and low, under 1% of GDP, and some of the notable names that have invested have had only modest success, even with government backing,\" said Justin Alexander, director of Khalij Economics and Gulf analyst at GlobalSource Partners. This has left the Saudi government and the Public Investment Fund to try to deliver on the crown prince's diversification promises, aided by a petrodollar windfall. A worsening global economic outlook and oil market volatility has raised the stakes for the government in pursuing Vision 2030, which includes a $500 billion project to build a huge, high-tech economic zone on the Red Sea called NEOM eventually meant to house nine million people. \"The government cannot afford to drive economic development indefinitely but for the time being there is no real alternative as domestic businesses are unfit to play that role, and FDI continues to disappoint,\" said Neil Quilliam, associate fellow at Chatham House. ($1 = 3.7575 riyals)",

            "text": "Low-cost U.S. carrier Allegiant (ALGT.O)New Tab expects fewer aircraft deliveries from Boeing (BA.N)New Tab this year, its president told Reuters, as the planemaker grapples with the fallout of a frightening incident last month when a cabin panel tore off of a 737 MAX 9 jet mid-flight. The Las Vegas-based airline was scheduled to receive 24 MAX planes in 2024, but Allegiant President Greg Anderson said it is working on the assumption that it will receive closer to 12 aircraft this year. \"We are in regular dialogue with Boeing on this,\" he said in an interview on Tuesday. \"We can manage through it as long as we have an orderly delivery cadence from Boeing.\" The planemaker has scrambled to explain and strengthen safety procedures since the Jan. 5 incident. Its production rate has been capped by regulators and closely scrutinized by lawmakers and customers. That has had a ripple effect on the industry, as several air carriers have said they are considering adjusting schedules or keeping older planes in service longer. In 2022, Allegiant placed an order for 50 of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle 737 MAX planes, rejecting offers from traditional supplier Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab . It was scheduled to take delivery of 10 of the jets in 2023, 24 in 2024, and 16 in 2025. Allegiant has traditionally relied on less expensive second-hand planes. With the introduction of MAX planes, it expected to launch new routes and reduce operating costs. The carrier has yet to receive its first MAX aircraft, said Anderson, adding the delivery is now expected in the coming months. The head of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Wednesday asked the planemaker to develop a comprehensive action plan to address \"systemic quality-control issues\" within 90 days, raising fresh questions as to how long the cap on production would last. The delays have prompted Allegiant to reactivate a few of its used Airbus A320s that it was planning to retire to boost capacity during summer peak flying season, Anderson said. Allegiant plans to boost capacity by 2% to 6% in 2024 from a year ago, and the reactivation of older jets means the delays \"shouldn't impact our capacity plans,\" he said. Boeing's problems, however, have left its customers in a spot. Ryanair (RYA.I)New Tab last week said the European carrier might have to remove some flights from its summer schedule because of Boeing's delivery delays. The cap on MAX production has also raised concerns at Southwest Airlines (LUV.N)New Tab , one of Boeing's loyal customers, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Last month, the Dallas-based airline said it expected to receive 79 MAX jets this year. If Boeing fails to deliver all those jets, the company could be forced to defer the retirements some of its older and less fuel-efficient planes. Southwest did not immediately respond to a request for comments. The planemaker's troubles have also sent United Airlines (UAL.O)New Tab scurrying for options. United last week said it was looking at options to mix some additional Airbus product into its \"Boeing heavy fleet\" and extend the life of some planes that were ready to retire. Allegiant's Anderson said the safety culture at the U.S. planemaker has \"rightfully been brought into focus,\" adding a stronger Boeing will be good for the industry. Allegiant is using its own experts as well as engineers from Lufthansa's (LHAG.DE)New Tab aircraft maintenance business, Lufthansa Technik, to ensure that the planes leaving Boeing's factory are of \"the quality and standard they need to be,\" he said. \"We've heightened our approach in that area,\" Anderson said.",

The U.S. Army \"reasonably evaluated Sikorsky's proposal as technically unacceptable because Sikorsky failed to provide the level of architectural detail required by the\" request for proposal, the GAO said in a statement. The Army awarded the contract in December in the hopes of ending a years-long competition for its next-generation helicopter that would partially replace its fleet of more than 2,000 medium-class UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters built by Sikorsky since the 1970s. The Army has said it plans to fly its remaining Black Hawk fleet through the 2060's. The initial contract award was for $232 million, but the first batch of helicopters in low rate production will be worth $7.1 billion. Ultimately, the contract is potentially worth around $70 billion - over decades - depending on how many the Army and U.S. allies order, the Army has said. In the FLARAA competition was Bell's V-280 \"Valor,\" a tiltrotor aircraft that has reached speeds in excess of 340 mph (547 kph) according to the Army. It beat out the entrant from Lockheed's Sikorsky unit and Boeing Co's (BA.N)New Tab SB-1 \"Defiant\" which has two coaxial rotors and a single pusher propeller and has reached speeds of 265 mph (426 kph), according to the Army. “We remain confident the Lockheed Martin Sikorsky and Boeing team submitted the most capable, affordable and lowest-risk Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft solution. We will review the GAO’s decision and determine our next steps,” the companies said in a statement. Lockheed could bring the matter before the US Court of Federal Claims.",

Airbus has been locked in a rowNew Tab with one of the industry's biggest buyers for months over damage to paintNew Tab and an underlying layer of lightning protection, which Qatar Airways says has led to the grounding of 20 jets by its domestic aviation regulator. In a rare statement airing a breakdown in relations between the planemaker and the launch customer of Europe's premier long-haul jet, Airbus said the A350s had been declared safe to fly by European regulators despite some \"surface degradation.\" \"The attempt by this customer to misrepresent this specific topic as an airworthiness issue represents a threat to the international protocols on safety matters,\" it said. Airbus officials confirmed the statement referred to Qatar Airways. A spokesman for the airline said it would not comment on the Airbus statement before reviewing it. Industry sources said there was no indication Qatar Airways was ready to back down in the dispute, which has already prompted it to exclude Airbus from a multi-billion-dollar deal to replace its 35 freighters, which is set to go to Boeing (BA.N)New Tab . At stake is the credibility of two of the industry's most powerful players and a potential compensation battle over hundreds of millions of dollars in estimated grounding costs. The row widened last week when documents seen by ReutersNew Tab revealed at least five other airlines had complained about paint or other skin flaws since late 2016. Delta Air Lines (DAL.N)New Tab joined the list of affected carriers this week, but so far only Qatar has seen jets being grounded read more . read more Exclusive photographs publishedNew Tab by Reuters have shown exposed and corroded lightning protection beneath cracked paint. \"We have worked actively with Qatar Airways in order to minimise the impact of this in-service surface degradation on their aircraft,\" Philippe Mhun, Airbus Executive Vice President Programmes & Services, told reporters. Mhun said Airbus had offered solutions to Qatar Airways from patches, to repairs of the anti-lightning material or repainting of entire aircraft, but Qatar Airways had declined the offer. Industry sources say Qatar Airways is reluctant to implement short-term fixes without a full breakdown of the root cause. Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said in London last week, \"we don't know if it is an airworthiness issue. We also don't know that it is not an airworthiness issue.\" read more The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has said \"no potential airworthiness issue has been identified to date\" and ruled out a link with a separate manufacturing flaw which prompted it to issue a draft safety directive for 13 A350s. Airbus says it understands the cause, though sources say a formal diagnosis may require further tests on surface ageing. The legal step taken by Airbus comes under a contract clause allowing for arbitration, Mhun said. Usually arbitration is carried out away from the public gaze, but Airbus said it was acting to \"defend its position and reputation\" while calling for a \"constructive dialogue\". Qatar Airways says its own brand and wide-body operations are at stake due to the grounding of 20 of its A350 jets, less than a year before the Gulf state hosts the FIFA World Cup. Some airlines have been pressuring Airbus to head off any damage to their brands as a result of the bitter public row between Airbus and a high-profile customer which has clashed with planemakers in the past, through rarely to such a degree. \"I have never seen anything like this. It is not only a problem between Airbus and Qatar Airways but it is also designed to prevent further damage to the A350's reputation with all operators,\" said aviation adviser Bertrand Grabowski.",

            "text": "Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) (ISRAI.UL) said on Wednesday it signed an agreement with Etihad Engineering to establish a facility in Abu Dhabi that will convert Boeing 777-300ER passenger planes into cargo aircraft. The new facility, which will operate as the company's maintenance centre in Abu Dhabi, aims to meet the growing demand for large cargo jets. \"Not only do we see the demand, but we view it as a greener, more profitable, highly innovative solution for our airline customers, and an excellent way to drive value for our business,\" Tony Douglas, chief executive of Etihad Aviation Group, said in a statement. Demand for cargo plane conversions has been on the rise with the increase in ecommerce and the decline in value of used planes during the COVID-19 pandemic. State-owned IAI currently converts Boeing 737, 747 and 767 passenger aircraft for cargo use. It has said it is currently developing a conversion method for the Boeing 777 and expects to finish the licensing process in 2023. The deal comes a year after Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed to normalise relations under the U.S.-sponsored Abraham Accords. Over the past year, Israeli firms have forged a number of deals in the UAE. In March, IAI said it would jointly develop an advanced drone defence system with the UAE's state-owned weapons maker EDGE. read more Yossi Melamed, head of IAI’s Aviation Group, said the latest deal adds a \"significant tier to the relations between Israel and the Gulf States\" and that \"additional agreements with companies in the region will arrive, and they will economically benefit all sides involved.\" IAI already operates cargo conversion sites including an existing line at its headquarters at Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv. Etihad Engineering is one of the largest commercial aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services providers in the Middle East, and the centre in Abu Dhabi will be the largest and most advanced in the Middle East, IAI said. It noted the facility will be certified by the UAE Civil Aviation Authority, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, and the European Aviation Safety Agency.",

Air India's replacement flight to ferry passengers to the original destination of San Francisco landed on Thursday, with the airline mobilising additional support to carry out clearance formalities for passengers upon arrival, it said. The original stranded aircraft's 216 passengers and 16 crew had been housed in makeshift accommodation at Russia's remote Magadan airport. Facilities at Magadan \"may not have met the standard\" Air India normally aims to provide, the airline said in a letter apologising to passengers for the delay in reaching San Francisco. Angry passengers had complained on Wednesday about inadequate food at their accommodation, which they said looked like a school. The Boeing (BA.N)New Tab 777 plane was on its way from Delhi to San Francisco before being diverted on Tuesday.",
