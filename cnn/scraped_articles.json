            "text": "Boeing on Monday scrambled to address safety and quality concerns about its planes ahead of a whistleblower hearing in the Senate on Wednesday. A briefing for journalists came in the wake of reports last week that the Federal Aviation Administration is looking into allegations raised by Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour that Boeing took shortcuts when manufacturing its 777 and 787 Dreamliner jets and that risk of catastrophic failure will increase as the planes age. Salehpour is set to be the key witness at a Wednesday hearing of the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations. Boeing, which has seen its once pristine reputation for safety and engineering quality badly diminished recently, held the briefing Monday to try to pre-emptively answer Salehpour, although the executives said they wouldn\u2019t comment directly on his allegations. Boeing has faced more than five years of questions about the safety and quality of its commercial jets following two fatal crashes of a different model, the 737 Max, in 2018 and 2019. Those crashes killed 346 people and led to a 20-month grounding of that jet. It came under renewed scrutiny earlier this year after a door plug blew out on an 737 Max flight by Alaska Airlines on January 5, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet. That has sparked investigations and allegations that some Boeing employees felt reluctant to raise questions about the safety of the planes they are building or inspecting for fear of retaliation. Boeing cites increased tips, vigorous tests While Salehpour charged last week that Boeing employees are scared to speak up about problems at factories, Boeing says the number of employee tips about quality and safety issues \u2014 as well as improvement ideas \u2014 has \u201cexploded\u201d since the Alaska Air incident. January and February submissions already equal the number of submissions for all of 2023, according to the company. \u201cWe\u2019re continually encouraging it,\u201d said Lisa Fahl, Boeing\u2019s vice president of engineering for Airplane Programs at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, during Monday\u2019s briefing. Fahl and Steve Chisholm, Boeing\u2019s vice president and chief engineer for mechanical and structural engineering, told media members Monday that Boeing\u2019s planes face stress tests designed to replicate far more flights taking place than they ever will in the real world. The average 787 does 600 flights a year, according to Chisholm, and the tests Boeing put the planes through simulated 165,000 flights. And they said real world inspections on the planes now in service show even after as many as 16 years of use, no evidence of fatigue in parts of the plane now facing questions. Chisholm said the planes were designed to pass tests replicating far more stress over many more flights than they are subjected to in the real world. \u201cFrankly we\u2019re not surprised by lack of fatigue findings,\u201d he said. Salehpour\u2019s complaint alleges crews assembling the plane failed to properly fill tiny gaps when joining separately manufactured parts of the fuselage.\u00a0That puts more wear on the plane, shortening its lifespan and risking \u201ccatastrophic\u201d failure, Salehpour\u2019s attorneys alleged. Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration have admitted that some of the planes did have problems with the gaps between parts of the fuselages that were wider than the standards set by Boeing. The delivered planes were allowed to continue to fly, but the non-conformance with Boeing\u2019s standards led to long periods in recent years during which the aircraft maker had to halt deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner. But Chisholm said the inspections done after those questions were raised have shown no problems in actual operations of the planes. He said some of the standards for the size of the gaps were changed in the wake of the inspections. Fahl described the original standards of a gap of only 5/1000th of an inch, as equal to the width of a human hair or two pieces of paper. Chisholm said the original standards were \u201chyper-conservative\u201d ones set by Boeing, not by regulators. \u201cIt was very difficult to meet that standard. There are areas where we\u2019ve increased what is allowable. We\u2019re [still] talking about very tight alignments,\u201d he said.",

            "text": "Globe-trotters are on the move again in a big way, boosting the rankings of a handful of international aviation hubs on the list of the world\u2019s busiest airports. There\u2019s no change at the top of the list. The No. 1 airport for passenger volume in 2023, Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson International, has held that position every year \u2014 except pandemic-walloped 2020 \u2014 for more than two decades. But for the first time, Dubai takes the No. 2 ranking, according to Airports Council International\u2019s preliminary rankings for 2023, released on Monday. \u201cDubai served around 87 million passengers in 2023. That is a year-to-year increase of 31%, and that is 1% higher than 2019. And they connected 262 destinations around 104 countries to 102 international carriers,\u201d said Luis Felipe de Oliveira, ACI World\u2019s director general. The airport\u2019s jump up from No. 5 in 2022 is representative of a big growth area in aviation, with industry expansion in emerging and developing economies in the Middle East and Asia Pacific expected at more than twice the rate of advanced economies in the decades to come, de Oliveira said. But Atlanta doesn\u2019t have too much to worry about for now. With 104.7 million passengers in 2023, Dubai\u2019s not nipping at its heels just yet. That figure is still about 5% below ATL\u2019s pre-pandemic 2019 passenger total, but de Oliveira said ACI expects Atlanta to serve about 110 million passengers in 2024 \u2013 bringing the airport back to 2019 passenger levels. Globally, passenger traffic in 2023 grew by 27% from 2022 to reach nearly 94% of 2019 results, with domestic travel rebounding more quickly from the pandemic \u2014 growing by 20% from 2022 to reach almost 97% of 2019 levels. The world\u2019s largest domestic market, the United States, had four more airports \u2013 all with significant domestic passenger shares \u2013 in the top 10 in 2023: Dallas/Fort Worth (No. 3), Denver (No. 6), Los Angeles (No. 8) and Chicago O\u2019Hare (No. 9). International travel is driving recovery But in 2023, it was the international market that drove recovery, growing about 37% to reach about 90% of 2019 figures. And while Dubai is the No. 2 airport for overall traffic, it\u2019s No. 1 in the world for international passengers. Plus, it has evolved into a destination in its own right. London Heathrow, another strong international player, jumped up from No. 8 in 2022 to No. 4 last year. But it was Tokyo Haneda in Japan that made the biggest leap \u2013 from No. 16 to No. 5, thanks largely to Japan\u2019s reopening. It\u2019s a welcome indicator that Asia\u2019s passenger numbers are getting back on track, de Oliveira said. Istanbul\u2019s airport held steady at No. 7, and Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi dropped one spot from No. 9 in 2022 to No. 10 last year. India, with an enormous population that\u2019s increasingly connected by air, is an example of growth in the industry\u2019s capillary network in different parts of the world. \u201cIn the US, you have a very good capillarity in the system \u2013 the small, medium and big airports connecting with each other. We don\u2019t have that in many parts of the world,\u201d de Oliveira said. But it\u2019s growing rapidly in India, he said, with Air India and IndiGo buying hundreds of aircraft and the government investing in the country\u2019s more than 140 airports. The 2023 global total passengers figure is close to 8.5 billion, according to ACI\u2019s preliminary figures. Smoothing out rough air The global outlook is \u201cvery positive\u201d for continued growth. \u201cIn 2020, we lost like 20 years of development of the aviation sector in one year, so we are recovering very fast considering that,\u201d de Oliveira said. In 2023, the system was able to cope better with surging demand than it did earlier in the pandemic rebound, he said, although there are still some pressure points, including a shortage of US air traffic controllers. There\u2019s also very high demand for new, more efficient aircraft to reduce fuel costs and increase sustainability. In addition to the most recent production slowdowns precipitated by issues with Boeing aircraft, supply chain slowdowns have contributed to a backlog of orders. The supply chain issues have improved, but the backlog is still significant, de Oliveira said. Aircraft delivery delays could affect growth if airlines aren\u2019t able to cope with demand, but he added that airlines are consequently likely to delay retiring less efficient planes to continue to meet strong demand. Everything that happened as a result of the pandemic has underlined the importance of being ready for future issues, de Oliveira said, and ACI is working with member airports to become more resilient. \u201cThat is always with the focus on the passenger \u2026 We have this ecosystem, if the ecosystem doesn\u2019t work well, the passenger suffers.\u201d World\u2019s top 10 busiest airports for passenger traffic in 2023 1.\u00a0 Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta, Georgia (ATL): \u00a0104.7 million passengers; up 11.7% from 2022 2.\u00a0 Dubai, United Arab Emirates (DXB): \u00a087 million passengers; up 31.7% from 2022 3.\u00a0 Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas (DFW): 81.8 million passengers; up 11.4% from 2022 4.\u00a0 London Heathrow, United Kingdom (LHR): 79.2 million passengers; up 28.5% from 2022 5.\u00a0 Tokyo Haneda, Japan (HND): 78.7 million passengers; up 55.1% from 2022 6.\u00a0 Denver, Colorado (DEN): 77.8 million passengers; up 12.3% from 2022 7.\u00a0 Istanbul, Turkey (IST): 76 million passengers; up 18.3% from 2022 8.\u00a0 Los Angeles, California (LAX): 75.1 million passengers; up 13.8% from 2022 9.\u00a0 Chicago O\u2019Hare, Illinois (ORD): 73.9 million passengers; up 8.1% from 2022 10.

            "title": "The space shuttle was revolutionary for its time. What went wrong?",
            "text": "Upon its inception, NASA\u2019s space shuttle program promised to usher in a new era of exploration, keeping astronauts space-bound with a reusable and relatively cheap ride into orbit. It was a project that forever altered the course of spaceflight with its triumphs \u2014 and its tragic failures. Deemed an \u201cengineering marvel,\u201d the first of five winged orbiters \u2014 the space shuttle Columbia \u2014 made its inaugural flight in 1981. Twenty-two years and 28 trips to space later, the same shuttle broke apart during its final return to Earth, killing all seven crew members on board. The tragedy spelled the end for the US space agency\u2019s transformative shuttle program. And its memory continues to reverberate in the halls of NASA today, leaving a lasting mark on its consideration of safety. \u201cHuman history teaches us that in exploration, after accidents like this occur, we can learn from them and further reduce risk, although we must honestly admit that risks can never be eliminated,\u201d said then-NASA Administrator Sean O\u2019Keefe, who ran the agency from 2001 to 2004, in a speech before members of Congress shortly after the Columbia disaster. After the shuttle program was retired, no US astronaut would travel to space on an American-made rocket for nearly a decade. Reimagining rocketry The space shuttle project was forged in the optimism of NASA\u2019s Apollo program, which landed 12 astronauts on the surface of the moon and bested America\u2019s Soviet rivals during the Cold War. Apollo was, however, extraordinarily expensive: NASA spent $25.8 billion\u00a0(or more than $200 billion when adjusted for inflation) \u2014 according to a cost analysis from space policy expert Casey Dreier of the nonprofit Planetary Society. With financial constraints on the horizon, by the mid-1970s, engineers within NASA were building an entirely new means of space transportation. Apollo used towering rockets and small capsules \u2014 destined to be flown just once \u2014 that would plunge back home from space and parachute to an ocean landing. The space shuttle concept was a remarkable pivot: Reusable, winged orbiters would take off strapped to rockets, sail through Earth\u2019s orbit and glide to an airplane-esque runway landing. From there, the shuttle could be refurbished and flown again, theoretically driving down the cost of each mission. Shuttle\u2019s legacy Over the course of three decades, NASA\u2019s fleet of space shuttles flew 135 missions \u2014 launching and repairing satellites, building a permanent home for astronauts with the International Space Station and commissioning the revolutionary Hubble Space Telescope. But the shuttle program, which ended in 2011, never lived up to the US space agency\u2019s initial vision. Each shuttle launch cost about $1.5 billion on average, according to a 2018 paper from a researcher at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center. That\u2019s hundreds of millions of dollars more than what the space agency had hoped for at the program\u2019s outset, even when adjusted for inflation. Long delays and technical setbacks also beleaguered its missions. \u201cEvery single mission that I was there for was scrubbed, rescheduled, delayed because something wasn\u2019t exactly right,\u201d said O\u2019Keefe, the former NASA administrator, in a new CNN documentary series, \u201cSpace Shuttle Columbia: The Final Flight.\u201d And two disasters \u2014 the Challenger explosion in 1986 and the loss of Columbia in 2003 \u2014 cost the lives of 14 astronauts. The Columbia disaster: Looking back On the morning of February 1, 2003, the Columbia orbiter was heading home from a 16-day mission to space. The seven-person crew on board had carried out dozens of science experiments while in orbit, and the astronauts were slated to land at 9:16 a.m. ET in Florida. NASA engineers knew that a piece of foam \u2014 used to insulate the shuttle\u2019s large, orange fuel tank \u2014 had broken off during the January 16 launch, striking the Columbia orbiter. The space agency\u2019s stance, however, was that the lightweight insulation material likely didn\u2019t cause significant harm. Some foam had broken off on earlier missions and caused slight damage, but it was deemed an \u201caccepted flight risk,\u201d according to the official Columbia accident investigation report. It was later revealed, however, that concerns about the foam\u2019s impact were swept under the rug by NASA management, according to previous reporting and \u201cSpace Shuttle Columbia: The Final Flight.\u201d \u201cI was very upset and angry and disappointed with my engineering organizations, top to bottom,\u201d said Rodney Rocha, a chief NASA shuttle engineer, in the new series. The astronauts even received an email from mission control alerting them about the foam strike on the eighth day of their mission, reassuring them there was no reason for alarm, according to NASA. But the assumption was wrong. An investigation later revealed the dislodged foam had struck Columbia\u2019s left wing during launch, damaging the spacecraft\u2019s thermal protection system. The issue didn\u2019t affect crew members while they spent more than two weeks in space. But heat protection is crucial for the dangerous return home. As with every mission that returns from orbit, the vehicle had to dive back into the thick of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere while still traveling at more than 17,000 miles per hour (27,359 kilometers per hour). The pressure and friction on a spacecraft can heat up the exterior to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,649 degrees Celsius). Reentry proved too much for the damaged Columbia shuttle. As the vehicle approached its destination, crossing over New Mexico into Texas, the orbiter began to disintegrate \u2014 visibly shedding chunks of debris. At 8:59 a.m. ET, ground controllers lost contact with the crew. The final dispatch came from mission commander Rick Husband, who said, \u201cRoger, uh,\u201d before he was cut off. At 9 a.m., onlookers saw Columbia explode over East Texas and watched in horror as it showered the area with debris. The realities of risk Two decades later, the Columbia tragedy and the broader shuttle program offer crucial perspective about the perils and triumphs of spaceflight. NASA entered the era confidently, anticipating that the odds of a shuttle being destroyed during flight were around 1 in 100,000. The space agency reevaluated that risk, estimating after the Challenger disaster that the\u00a0shuttle had carried\u00a0a 1 in 100 chance of disaster. \u201cIf somebody told me, \u2018Hey, you can go on this roller coaster ride, and there\u2019s a 1 in 100 chance that you\u2019ll die. Well, there\u2019s no chance in the world \u2014 no chance in hell \u2014 I would do that,\u201d US Sen. Mark Kelly, a former NASA space shuttle astronaut, told \u201cThe Final Flight\u201d documentarians. \u201cBut I also think that people generally think it\u2019s not going to be them,\u201d Kelly added.",

The bank\u2019s first-quarter revenue increased by 9% from the year before, to $41.9 billion. That\u2019s more than analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected. Earnings per share came in at $4.44, also higher than the $4.17 estimated by FactSet. Still, CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors that trouble could lie ahead. \u201cMany economic indicators continue to be favorable. However, looking ahead, we remain alert to a number of significant uncertain forces,\u201d he wrote in a press release Friday. Dimon cited growing geopolitical tensions and \u201cpersistent inflationary pressures, which may likely continue,\u201d as ongoing worries. \u201cWe do not know how these factors will play out, but we must prepare the Firm for a wide range of potential environments to ensure that we can consistently be there for clients,\u201d he said. On a call with reporters Friday morning, Dimon said American consumers still have excess savings, stocks are higher and unemployment is low. \u201cEven if we go into recession, they\u2019re in pretty good shape,\u201d he noted. But he also said that lower-income earners are quickly running out of extra money. The bank is beginning to see some cracks in the subprime auto loan market. Dimon, calling in from an investment banking conference in Florida, told reporters that he believes market pricing is likely \u201ctoo happy\u201d right now and that the chance of a bad outcome is \u201chigher than other people think.\u201d But, Dimon said, \u201cthe important thing isn\u2019t the economy \u2014 whether we have a mild recession or soft landing or something like that,\u201d he said, referring to a scenario where inflation is vanquished without raising unemployment levels. What\u2019s important, he said, \u201cis the future of the free world,\u201d referring to Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. \u201cIt could be determinative on what happens to the global economy if oil and gas prices go too high,\u201d Dimon said. The impact of \u2018higher for longer\u2019 rates JPMorgan Chase acquired most of First Republic Bank\u2019s assets last May after the San Francisco-based regional bank was seized by the government. That acquisition added billions of dollars in loans to the bank\u2019s balance sheet, boosting its income from interest. JPMorgan Chase reported that average loans had increased 16% from the year before, mostly because of First Republic. Net interest income, or NII, from those loans (that\u2019s the money a bank earns from loans minus the interest it pays on deposits) increased by 11% to $23.2 billion. But the bank also said that NII could fall short of Wall Street expectations for the year. Net interest income has been a key metric for analysts this quarter as they look to see how banks react to elevated interest rates by the Federal Reserve. Banks, including JPMorgan, have brought in record profits, boosted by NII, as the central bank raised interest rates. JPMorgan Chase also said on Friday that it would take a one-time $725 million charge by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation related to the mess that Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank left in the wake of their collapses last spring. It was large banks that mostly footed that bill. Shares of the bank fell by 4.3% in morning trading but are up 45% over the last 12 months. Mixed earnings Separately, investment giant BlackRock reported that its assets under management swelled to a record $10.5 trillion during the first quarter. The company also beat top- and bottom-line expectations. Wells Fargo, which also reported its first-quarter earnings Friday, topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations but saw an 8% decline in net interest income from the prior year. The company also noted a $284 million expense during the first quarter related to the FDIC\u2019s special assessment. Citigroup reported net income of $3.4 billion in the first quarter, or $1.58 a share, outpacing analysts\u2019 expectations for $1.18 a share, according to FactSet. CEO Jane Fraser said Friday the bank finished its organizational restructuring, which included layoffs, last month. The company saw $225 million in restructuring charges during the first quarter, largely driven by severance and other corporate reshuffling costs. Citi also noted a $251 million expense related to the FDIC\u2019s cleanup of the regional bank collapses last year. Shares of Wells Fargo were up slightly on Friday morning while shares of BlackRock and Citigroup fell.",

            "text": "When it comes to building planes, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun is all about streamlining costs. An accountant by training, Calhoun has prioritized fiscal discipline over his four years at the helm, tightening the belt to free up cash flow and put the company on better financial footing. But when it comes to living the CEO lifestyle, that thriftiness goes right out the window. See here: Boeing reported in a regulatory filing that four top executives, including Calhoun, got an extra half-million dollars worth of personal private jet travel on the company\u2019s dime that had previously been improperly recorded as business travel, my colleague Chris Isidore writes.  That oopsie was discovered in an internal review, which was prompted by a\u00a0Wall Street Journal investigation\u00a0last year into Boeing executives\u2019 private jet travel, the paper reported Thursday. To be clear: Boeing requires Calhoun, who is stepping down later this year, to use its private jets for business and personal travel for security reasons. And that\u2019s pretty standard. If he\u2019s flying from the company\u2019s headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, to its production facility outside Seattle, that\u2019s generally considered a perk of the job. But when a CEO uses the company jet for a family vacation, that usually counts as taxable income. The IRS is a stickler about these things, and it recently announced it would be cracking down on executives who have been illegally writing off personal trips as business expenses. There is no evidence anyone from Boeing was doing that, but the crackdown signals that it\u2019s happening with some regularity in Corporate America. Over the last three years, Calhoun racked up $979,000 in personal air travel, according to the company. Boeing did not have any comment beyond the information in the filing. Why it matters In all the chatter about Boeing\u2019s disastrous start to 2024, we\u2019ve barely had time to talk about the crisis looming on the horizon: a potential strike by its largest labor union. A 10-year contract covering 30,000 Seattle-area machinists\u00a0 expires September 12. Negotiations started last month \u2014 delayed to give the company some slack while dealing with multiple federal probes into the January 5 door-plug blowout. The machinists are seeking a 40% pay bump over three years and a seat on the board of directors. It\u2019s going to be pretty awkward for Boeing leadership to try to nickel and dime the people who build the planes while lavishing Calhoun with a nearly $33 million payday last year (a 45% bump from 2022), and teeing up his $45 million retirement package, and batting down questions about the boss bouncing between his two homes, neither of which are located near the company\u2019s headquarters. \u201cWith what\u2019s going on these days, we are oftentimes the last line of defense, and we have to save this company from itself,\u201d the union\u2019s president, Jon Holden, told the FT last week.",

The letter was signed by industry lobby group\u00a0Airlines for America \u2014 whose members include American Airlines (AAL), Delta (DAL) and United (UAL) \u2014 and other unions representing aviation workers, including the Air Line Pilots Association. \u201cIf the growth of the Chinese aviation market is allowed to continue unchecked and without concern for equality of access in the market, flights will continue to be relinquished to Chinese carriers at the expense of US workers and businesses,\u201d it added. In February, Washington said it will allow Chinese airlines to further increase their direct passenger flights to the United States, in an effort to gradually restore aviation services that had been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Chinese carriers were given approval by US officials to make 50 weekly round trips to and from the United States, up from 35, from March 31. But the increased number is still only a fraction of the more than 150 weekly round trips allowed by each side before curbs were imposed in early 2020. In the letter, American carriers said China implemented strict limits to market access during the pandemic and imposed challenging rules affecting operations, customers and the treatment of US airline crew. The \u201canti-competitive disadvantage\u201d with China worsened in 2022, the letter said, when the Asian country\u2019s airlines continued to access Russian airspace, while US carriers stopped using it as a result of Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February of that year. Having to avoid Russian airspace adds time and costs to flights. \u201cThese actions demonstrated the clear need for the US government to establish a policy that protects US aviation workers, industry and air travelers,\u201d it said. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said on Friday that increasing direct flights was the \u201cconsensus reached\u201d when Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden met in San Francisco in November. \u201cIt [boosting flights] will help the two peoples strengthen exchanges and enhance mutual understanding,\u201d the ministry added. \u2014 Hassan Tayir contributed reporting.",

            "title": "Boeing spent $500,000 more than it previously disclosed on personal private jet trips for top executives",
            "text": "Embattled airplane maker Boeing disclosed it lavished an additional $546,000 on the cost of personal air travel in recent years for four top executives, including CEO Dave Calhoun, who announced last month that he will leave the company by the end of the year. The increased spending estimate, disclosed in a recent company filing, brought the total cost to the company for the personal air travel for the four to $1.9 million since 2021. Besides Calhoun, the other executives include CFO Brian West; Stan Deal, who recently departed as CEO of its commercial airplane unit; and Theodore Colbert, the CEO of its defense, space and security business. The disclosure comes as the plane maker is facing additional scrutiny for a series of safety incidents, including a midair blowout of part of a fuselage in January, which prompted a number of investigations into the company\u2019s practices, an executive shakeup and promises that the company will turn itself around. The air travel is part of what are known as perquisites, or perks granted the executives, which also include ground transportation, lodging and meals during personal travel. And for air travel, the reported costs include only the incremental costs to Boeing, such as fuel, crew travel expenses, on-board meals, landing fees, and parking costs. It does not include the cost of the corporate jets or the salaries of the flight crew, which Boeing said it would be paying whether or not the executives made the personal trips. The cost of personal air travel by Calhoun alone came to $979,000 during those three years. The upward adjustment means that Boeing spent at least $734,000 in 2022 and $306,000 in 2021 on these executives\u2019 personal air travel, according to figures provided. Some of the amounts for air travel for Colbert and Deal are not broken out for the earlier years, despite the increased cost now being reported for those years for all four. And 2023 personal air travel costs for the four came to $872,000. Boeing has been struggling financially for five years, since fatal crashes of its 737 Max in late 2018 and early 2019 resulted in a 20-month grounding of its best-selling plane. It was also hit by the pandemic, which caused a near-halt in air travel for months and deep losses at most airlines that buy its planes. Since the start of the grounding in 2019 the company has reported adjusted losses totaling more than $31 billion, and losses are projected to continue going forward. Company policy requires its CEO to fly on its fleet of private jets, or leased aircraft, even when flying for personal reasons for security reasons, and the other top executives are permitted to do so as well when aircraft are available. But an internal company review of some of the flights that had previously been classified as business travel determined the flights should be classified as personal travel under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, according to the filing. That review resulted in a newly reported cost of personal travel that was $546,000 more in 2022 and 2021 than previously disclosed. That review appears to have been conducted after a September 2023 article in the Wall Street Journal detailing the perks of top Boeing executives, including the liberal use of the aircraft to travel from homes far from company headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia. The new filing came Friday evening. Boeing did not have any comment on the costs of the executives\u2019 personal air travel beyond the information in the filing. That Friday filing also disclosed that Calhoun\u2019s total compensation for 2023 came to $32.8 million, up 45% from his 2022 compensation. He did decline his annual incentive bonus, which would have paid him an additional $2.8 million, after a Boeing 737 Max plane being flown by Alaska Airlines on January 5 had a door plug blow out, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. The incident sparked a series of federal investigations, a temporary grounding, executive ousters and renewed questions about the safety and quality of Boeing planes. Last month, Calhoun announced he would step down as CEO of the embattled aircraft maker by the end of the year. At the same time, it was announced that Deal would retire from his position atop Boeing Commercial Airplanes, effective immediately.",

            "title": "Boeing won\u2019t even consider moving HQ back to Seattle",
            "text": "It\u2019s been a brutal six years for Boeing, with two fatal jet crashes kicking off a series of safety crises \u2014 and raising concerns about the quality and safety of the planes rolling off its assembly lines. As Boeing scrambles to repair its reputation, some critics and shareholders are asking: Why not move headquarters away from the shadow of Washington, D.C., \ufeffand back home to its roots in Seattle? But Boeing has now made clear: We are not interested. An individual Boeing stockholder, Walter Ryan, wanted to put the question of a move up for a vote during the company\u2019s May 17 annual shareholder meeting. He filed his proposal in October for the shareholder vote, which would have been non-binding \u2014 but in February, Boeing went to the Securities and Exchange Commission, ultimately winning approval to block the vote. Ryan, who owns 10,000 shares of Boeing stock, lives in Las Vegas and has never been to Seattle. But he believes that if Boeing is to fix its current quality and safety problems, the company\u2019s top management should be back in Seattle \u2014 near where most of its commercial aircraft are still manufactured. \u201cI think they need some hands-on overseeing, and by som\ufeffebody who has skin in the game,\u201d Ryan told CNN. Boeing\u2019s corporate offices had been in Seattle from its founding in 1916 until it relocated to Chicago in 2001.\ufeff Then in 2022, Boeing corporate moved again \u2014 this time to Arlington, Virginia, near the Pentagon and across the river from Capitol Hill. Most manufacturing, however, remains more than 2,300 miles away in Seattle. \u201cThey want to be next to government,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIs that a sound idea? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d It isn\u2019t only shareholders like Ryan who believe a return to Seattle would benefit Boeing. \u201cPart of it would be symbolic,\u201d said Shem Malmquist, a Boeing 777 pilot and instructor of aviation safety at Florida Tech. \u201cBut it\u2019s also going to be better culturally. In the end, the closer the top management is to the production and what\u2019s going on and the engineers, the better.\u201d Boeing\u2019s response In his proposal he wanted presented to shareholders, Ryan said the corporate move from Seattle and separation from the core manufacturing business resulted in major issues related to \u201cengineering and quality problems, and Boeing\u2019s historic credibility,\u201d \u2014 concerns he said are now foremost \u201cin the minds of both travelers and shareholders.\u201d Ryan wrote the proposal even before a headline-grabbing incident in January, when the door panel of a Boeing 737 Max blew off in the middle of an Alaska Airlines flight, later found to be because the aircraft left the factory missing crucial bolts needed to keep it in place. Boeing\u2019s attorneys argued to the SEC that this isn\u2019t an appropriate issue for shareholder vote: \u201cThe proposal seeks to \u2018micro-manage\u2019 the company by probing too deeply into matters of a complex nature upon which shareholders, as a group, would not be in a position to make an informed judgment.\u201d Further, Boeing\u2019s attorneys dismissed the premise of Ryan\u2019s argument, calling it \u201can unsupported theory that certain manufacturing issues experienced by Boeing would have been avoided simply because the company\u2019s headquarters were located in a particular city, emphasizing, among other things, management\u2019s ability to walk the factory floor.\u201d The SEC agreed that Boeing it did not need to put Ryan\u2019s proposal on its proxy statement, which was released Friday. Boeing told CNN it did not have any comment beyond those included in its filing to the agency. Ryan said he believes his proposal \u2014 which would have allowed shareholders only to \u201crecommend\u201d a move back to Seattle, not mandate it \u2014 would have won had it been put up for a vote. \u201cThat\u2019s why I sent it in. I thought it would pass, and thought it would be a good idea,\u201d he told CNN. Speaking broadly, however, even shareholder proposals that are put to a vote are not likely to pass \u2014 especially recently. According to Institutional Shareholder Services, which tracks shareholder votes, only 5.4% of votes held in 2023 on shareholder proposals received majority support. That\u2019s down sharply from 12.6% in 2022, and 19.5% in 2021.",

            "text": "On the edge of the East China Sea, CNN was on board a\u00a0B-52 bomber\u00a0as it\u00a0turned northeast \u2013 toward Alaska, the US and Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana \u2013\u00a0when\u00a0the oil pressure gauge for one of its engines\u00a0began flickering erratically. Nineteen hours into one of the longest military missions\u00a0the US carries out, the crew had already\u00a0contended with\u00a0communications issues and had to make pinpoint fuel calculations\u00a0as they navigated their 13,000-mile journey from Louisiana to Japan and back again. But this was something different. Up front, the two pilots began working through their checklists. Capt. Jinan Andrews read each step out loud, while Capt. Tramaine \u201cOmaha\u201d Barnett piloted the jet. Sitting on the massive bomber\u2019s sole bunk, the third pilot on the flight crew, Capt. Sabin \u201cJett\u201d Park, backed them up, making sure they didn\u2019t miss any items. With 14 hours of flying and nearly 7,000 miles separating the strategic bomber from its home base, the pilots made the decision to shut the engine down. The B-52 that accompanied us across the Pacific Ocean had landed in Japan. Now our flight, MYLAR11, would be flying back alone and down an engine. Fortunately, the B-52 has multiple engines, but it\u2019s a reminder that the US military is still relying on an aircraft first flown in the 1950s that has outlasted the Cold War by more than 30 years. The Boeing B-52H Stratofortress is America\u2019s primary strategic bomber, taking part in every US war since Vietnam. CNN gained exclusive access to an epic flight on one of the venerable eight-engined jets that serve as\u00a0an instantly recognizable symbol of American air power. This particular jet was manufactured in 1961 and though they are decades older than their crew members, B-52s remain the cornerstone of the US bomber fleet,\u00a0sending\u00a0a high-profile message to\u00a0US\u00a0allies and adversaries. \u201cIf you would go back and look at both the national leadership of Russia and the national leadership of China, what do they react to?\u201d asks Maj. Gen. Jason Armagost, the commander of the Eighth Air Force. \u201cWe see that they publicly comment about our bomber task force missions, particularly when it involves others in very joint and public ways.\u201d Our flight took off in the pre-dawn hours of April 1 for one of the longest missions in the world. The B-52 would fly from the continental US, down Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Islands, off Russia\u2019s east coast and down by China and North Korea to a block of airspace off the Korean Peninsula. Then, without landing, MYLAR 11 would fly in formation with fighters from South Korea and Japan before returning home. The flight would take 33 hours and cover more than 13,000 miles. The jet cruised at about 28,000 feet, mostly over the icy waters of the north Pacific Ocean, where waves were predicted to exceed 20 feet. In total, the B-52 was expected to burn 105,000 gallons of jet fuel during the flight. \u201cNot only are we one of the most visible and flexible legs of the nuclear triad, but it\u2019s just a really easy way for the Air Force and the US to assure our allies,\u201d said Capt. Bo \u201cNATO\u201d Cain, a weapon systems officer on the flight.\u00a0The nuclear triad, which includes strategic bombers, ballistic missile silos, and ballistic missile submarines, comprises America\u2019s nuclear deterrent. The B-52 is the most mobile element of the triad. \u201cWe have a B-52 where you need it, when you need it, within 48 hours.\u201d An epic journey A standard crew for missions of this length is three pilots, three weapon systems officers, and one electronic warfare officer. Most of the crew on MYLAR11 had never been on a mission this long. A few hours into the flight, one thing becomes painfully obvious: the B-52 was never built for comfort. Though the jet has a\u00a0185-foot\u00a0wingspan and a length of nearly 160 feet, the entire crew is crammed into the front portion of the jet, split between the confined upper deck and the windowless lower deck. The pilots rotate spots, with one frequently resting in the only bunk on board. For the rest of the crew, finding a position to rest often requires curling up on the floor or leaning against a panel. Capt. Leo \u201cSwabbie\u201d Weber, a weapon systems officer, described his first 30+ hour flight as a \u201croller coaster ride.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re excited when you take off, you go through your sleepy lulls and then you realize you\u2019re not even a quarter of the way yet,\u201d he said. \u201cTrying to stay focused has been tough but a challenge that I accept and enjoy.\u201d In the long stretches of flight between four aerial refuelings, the crew passes the time with casual conversation, rest and snacks. On MYLAR11, Lt. Rebecca \u201cVulcan\u201d Moore, the electronic warfare officer, brought chicken nuggets for the crew, which she was ready to heat up in the tiny oven perched behind the rows of circuit breakers. Mini-pizza bagels and chocolate chip cookies are also crew favorites. Moore\u2019s official role is to track threats outside the jet, but she takes it upon herself to know how everyone is doing inside it. \u201cI am trying to make sure I\u2019m paying attention to who\u2019s tired? Is somebody hungry? Is there something I can help somebody with?\u201d said Moore. \u201cAs you\u2019ve seen, this is an old jet, and it takes a full crew to work all of the many problems that come with it.\u201d Future of the B-52 The Air Force is planning to upgrade the B-52H to newer B-52J models, giving them more efficient engines, upgraded avionics and new radars. The modernization program will keep the jets flying for nearly a century since they first entered service in the mid-1950s. \u201cFor decades to come, we\u2019re going to be able to see how a jet that\u2019s been around for decades and decades can continue to evolve with the times and be just as capable, if not more capable, than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d said Lt. Col. Jared Patterson, commander of the 20th Bomb Squadron. This year, the Air Force began low-rate production of the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider, the next generation of stealth bomber. China is not far behind, with Beijing promising that its secretive H-20 strategic bomber will soon be unveiled publicly. The B-52s proponents insist it still has a role in the future. \u201cThis has been probably the most adaptable airframe potentially in the history of aerospace,\u201d said Col. Michael Maginness, commander of the 2nd Bomb Wing. \u201cIt started its life out as a high-level nuclear bomber. We turned it into a low-level penetrating bomber. We turned it into a standoff cruise missile platform. And along the way, it picked up just about every other air-to-ground mission set in the US Department of Defense.\u201d The mission area On the western edge of the Pacific Ocean, MYLAR11 reaches the mission area, a rectangle of air space between southern Japan and South Korea. Hours earlier, North Korea test fired a mid-range ballistic missile, a stark reminder of the threats in the area. In October, Chinese fighter jets intercepted a B-52 bomber at night over the South China Sea, south of our position. The Chinese jet flew within 10 feet of the much larger bomber in what the US called an \u201cunsafe intercept.\u201d This time, it\u2019s allied fighters nearby. Between layers of clouds, our B-52 and a second accompanying bomber fly in formation with Japanese and South Korean fighters, who take up positions off our wings. In reduced visibility with multiple aircraft flying close together, the crew remains alert. But the smaller fighters, who don\u2019t have the endurance of the massive bomber, can\u2019t linger long. The mission requires precise timing. \u201cThe more players there are, the more complex and interesting the mission gets,\u201d said Capt. Sabin \u201cJett\u201d Park, one of the B-52 pilots. After snapping a few pictures of the jets in formation, we soon turn back for home when the caution light on engine 5 shines bright orange. Within minutes, the crew shuts down the engine. There is no panic - just a management of risk. Even with one engine out, the B-52 has seven engines to carry it home. It is not a smart airplane like modern 5th generation fighters, but it is redundant, with numerous backup systems to carry it through its missions. \u201cDespite how many years the B-52 has been running, and it being considered a legacy aircraft, it is a very formidable one,\u201d said Capt. Jinan Andrews. \u201cShe is a tough girl.\u201d After skirting the airspace off eastern Russia on the return flight, we settle in for the long journey home. Everyone is tired, especially as we approach the 24-hour mark of the flight, but the mission is not yet complete. Landing any aircraft is a challenge, one made more difficult by the duration of the flight. And the B-52 has one final surprise for the crew. On final approach, with Barksdale Air Force Base looming off our nose, the right main gear does not extend. \u201cGo ahead and emergency extend it,\u201d orders Capt. Tramaine \u201cOmaha\u201d Barnett, the mission commander. Seconds later, we touch down after 33 hours on runway 33, deploying the jet\u2019s drag parachute as we slow down on the runway.

            "title": "Delta posts strong earnings in tough quarter for US airlines",
            "text": "Delta Air Lines reported vastly improved earnings in the first quarter, and the company said results should remain strong the rest of the year. The Atlanta-based airline said its adjusted earnings came in at $380 million, or 45 cents a share, up from $217 million, up 75% from a year earlier. It easily topped Wall Street analysts\u2019 consensus forecast of 36 cents a share. Revenue of $12.6 billion was up 6% and a record for the first three months of the year. It posted the increase despite the average revenue passengers paid to fly every mile slipping 2% in the period. Passenger revenue when adjusted for capacity, another measure of fares, was flat compared to a year ago. The first quarter is typically the least profitable period of the year for US airlines. Delta predicted it would report record revenue in the second quarter, it said it expects thinner profit margins. So it now expects earnings per share of between $2.20 to $2.50, which would be down from the record adjusted earnings per share of $2.64 a year ago. But it said it remains on target to reach full-year of $6 to $7 per share, which could be above the $6.25 a share it reported for 2023. Losses expected at at other US airlines Delta has been less affected that some of its major rivals whose operations were disrupted by problems at Boeing. Delta has no 737 Max jets in its fleet currently, although it has placed orders for some of the jets. Only about half of its mainline jets come from Boeing, compared to about 80% of United Airlines\u2019 fleet, and 100% of the planes flown by Southwest. And this is expected to be a difficult quarter for the US airline industry, with all the other US airlines among America\u2019s nine largest carriers forecast to report losses in the period, whether or not they fly Boeing or Airbus jets. With fares flat to lower and costs including labor and fuel rising, making a profit in the historically slow period is likely to prove difficult. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said there is strong demand going forward though. The airline had its 11 busiest days for booking tickets in its history during the course of the quarter, and he says demand for business travel has been especially strong. But he acknowledged that there are rising concerns about airline safety in the wake of a January 5 Alaska Airlines flight in which the door plug of a 737 Max blew off, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the 737 Max flight. Subsequent incidents reported in the media have only added to passenger worries. \u201cThe headlines, you can\u2019t escape it,\u201d he said, but noted that safety at Delta, as well as at other airlines, is a top priority. \u201cUS aviation travel is the safest form of transportation in the world,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s safer than driving, it\u2019s safer than trains, it\u2019s safer than walking.\u201d Delays in jet deliveries Delta has not taken a delivery of a Boeing jet since 2019. In July 2022 it placed an order for 100 of the Boeing 737 Max 10 jets, the largest version of the Max. It was originally due to start taking deliveries of those jets next year. The Federal Aviation Administration has yet to certify that plane to carry passengers, but criticism of Boeing\u2019s safety and the quality controls in the wake of the Alaska Air incident prompted Boeing to withdraw its request for a waiver necessary to get certification this year. That incident prompted United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby to announce it was no longer counting on the 737 Max 10 planes it had already ordered from Boeing, saying the problem was the \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d for the airline\u2019s expectations for the plane. Bastian didn\u2019t sound much more hopeful for when Delta might get the Max 10 jets it ordered. \u201cI\u2019m confident it will deliver at some point,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s two years, three years, four years from now, I don\u2019t think anyone knows.\u201d Shares of Delta gained 4% in premarket trading on the report.

            "text": "Boeing has achieved the unthinkable this week: It managed to fall even deeper into crisis. Adding to an already miserable start to 2024, Boeing stood accused Tuesday of routinely ignoring a whistleblower\u2019s complaints about the allegedly critically flawed manufacturing process for its 787 Dreamliner planes. The whistleblower claimed Boeing retaliated against him and put him on the 777 unit as punishment. That\u2019s when, he says, he found even more production problems. Boeing strongly denies the claims and says it is confident in the safety of its aircraft. Still, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would investigate \u2014\u00a0adding to a growing list of federal probes into the beleaguered company, including a criminal investigation. And next week, a Senate subcommittee will hear testimony about the whistleblower\u2019s case and will presumably air more of Boeing\u2019s dirty laundry in public. More allegations of lax safety standards are the last thing the company \u2014 and the flying public \u2014\u00a0need right now. The whistleblower complaint is doing further damage to Boeing\u2019s already battered public image: a company with a broken safety record, led by highly paid executives who are careless about quality standards. Yet the bad news for Boeing apparently knows no end. The whistleblower\u2019s accusations The whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, a Boeing engineer, alleged that Boeing took shortcuts when manufacturing its 777 and 787 Dreamliner jets \u2014\u00a0skipping crucial safety steps, which could lead to catastrophic failure of the airplanes as they age. The shortcuts could dramatically reduce the airplanes\u2019 expected lifespan of up to 50 years in service.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0was first to report the whistleblower\u2019s claims. His formal complaint to the FAA, filed in January and made public Tuesday, was not entirely new \u2014\u00a0the FAA had already investigated Boeing over 787 production concerns and halted 787 deliveries. But Salehpour\u2019s complaint shed new light on how crews assembling the 787 Dreamliner apparently failed to properly fill tiny gaps when joining separately manufactured parts of the fuselage for 1,000 planes. That could add stress on the planes\u2019 joints, something that can be hard to identify in inspections, Salehpour said. He alleged Boeing knew about the process errors and, what\u2019s more, encouraged them in order to reduce 787 assembly bottlenecks. Boeing has said the 787 is safe to fly and, before halting deliveries of the model, the FAA rigorously scrutinized Boeing\u2019s manufacturing processes that Salehpour questioned. It ultimately approved the planes for shipments to airlines in March 2023 after becoming satisfied that Boeing had fixed the problem. \u201cThese claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate and do not represent the comprehensive work Boeing has done to ensure the quality and long-term safety of the aircraft,\u201d the company said in a statement Tuesday. Salehpour said that in his new role at the 777 unit he discovered subpar work, with crews misaligning body pieces while Boeing pressured engineers to approve work they had not yet inspected. \u201cWe are fully confident in the safety and durability of the 777 family,\u201d Boeing said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThese claims are inaccurate.\u201d How Boeing got here The latest accusations are pouring gasoline on a dumpster fire. Critics argue the company\u2019s once sterling safety reputation was tarnished in its ill-advised 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas, and it has been all downhill from there, culminating in two fatal crashes of the 737 Max in 2018 and 2019. Boeing acknowledged it was liable for those crashes \u2014\u00a0and that they were caused by a design flaw it has since fixed after a nearly two-year grounding. The recent nonstop streak of bad news began during the last week of 2023, when an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two 737 Max aircraft. Then, during the first weekend of 2024, part of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max\u00a0blew off the side of the plane\u00a0just after take-off, and Boeing has been in crisis mode ever since. A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board revealed that Boeing\u00a0probably did not put the bolts\u00a0in the so-called door plug that are designed to prevent the part from blowing off the plane. Boeing hasn\u2019t acknowledged the specific accusations in the federal report, although CEO Dave Calhoun admitted the company made a mistake and said in response to the probe that Boeing is ultimately responsible. That incident resulted in a temporary nationwide grounding of certain 737 Max jets, followed by congressional hearings, production and delivery delays, multiple federal investigations \u2014 including the criminal probe \u2014 and a fall of about 30% in Boeing\u2019s stock this year, which shaved nearly $50 billion off the company\u2019s market valuation. The bad news didn\u2019t stop there. In February, pilots on a United Airlines 737 Max reported that the flight controls\u00a0jammed as the plane landed\u00a0in Newark, New Jersey. A month ago, the FAA flagged safety issues\u00a0with the de-icing equipment on 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner models that could cause engines to lose thrust. The FAA is allowing the planes to continue flying and Boeing said the problem does not pose an immediate safety risk. But, after reviewing Boeing\u2019s production workflow and standards, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said last month that the regulator found issues with \u201creally important\u201d aspects of Boeing\u2019s manufacturing and assembly line and gave the company until late May to produce a plan to fix is production problems. Boeing said it is working on several of the issues Whitaker identified. What\u2019s next for Boeing The fallout for Boeing has reached the top ranks of its leadership. The company has let several executives go, including the overseer of its commercial jets and a longtime executive in charge of the 737 Max unit. CEO Dave Calhoun also said he would step down before the end of the year \u2014\u00a0after he was paid $32.8 million last year and as he is set to take home $45 million for his retirement. Boeing\u2019s latest problems will cost it dearly: Airl\ufeffines effectively stopped ordering planes from Boeing in January, and the only 737 Max planes they ordered last month were for the version that isn\u2019t allowed to fly yet \u2014\u00a0specifically, the larger Max 10 \u2014\u00a0because of the de-icing issue. The company could also be subject to hefty fines and onerous lawsuits. Boeing has already paid Alaska Airlines more than $150 million in compensation for the temporary grounding of its planes following the door plug blowout. The company hasn\u2019t turned a profit in years, and the Alaska Airlines incident won\u2019t help Boeing make money this year either. Boeing faces no existential threat, though. The company has just one major competitor in the production of commercial aircraft globally \u2014\u00a0Airbus. Airlines can\u2019t easily switch between airplane manufacturers, making the company immune to typical market forces like passengers choosing a different manufacturer. Although there\u2019s some evidence that angry or nervous flyers prefer Airbus flights, opting for that can be impractical or impossible depending on where they want to travel. Still, Boeing\u2019s shareholders, regulators and customers are growing more irate by the day, and the company is ultimately beholden to them. Boeing\u2019s already bruised reputation means regaining airlines\u2019 trust could prove difficult \u2014\u00a0let alone the confidence of flabbergasted regulators. The drip, drip, drip of bad news makes a turnaround even harder. With new leadership on its way, Boeing\u2019s future top brass have their work cut out for them. And the world\u2019s eyes will be on them.",

Whistleblower Sam Salehpour, a Boeing engineer, alleges that Boeing took shortcuts when manufacturing its 777 and 787 Dreamliner jets, and that the risks could become catastrophic as the airplanes age. The New York Times was first to report the whistleblower complaint. His formal complaint to the Federal Aviation Administration, filed in January and made public on Tuesday, is not specific to the newer 737 Max jet that has been grounded twice by the Federal Aviation Administration. Salehpour on Tuesday said his complaint raises \u201ctwo quality issues that may dramatically reduce the life of the planes.\u201d \u201cI am doing this not because I want Boeing to fail, but because I want it to succeed and prevent crashes from happening,\u201d Salehpour told reporters on a conference call Tuesday.\u00a0\u201cThe truth is Boeing can\u2019t keep going the way it is.\u00a0It needs to do a little bit better, I think.\u201d The FAA has interviewed Salehpour as part of its investigation, his attorney Lisa Banks said.\u00a0The FAA said it investigates all whistleblower complaints. \u201cVoluntary reporting without fear of reprisal is a critical component in aviation safety,\u201d the FAA said.\u00a0 \u201cWe strongly encourage everyone in the aviation industry to share information.\u201d A Senate subcommittee will also take up the concerns at a hearing next week. \u201cWe are fully confident in the safety and durability of the 777 family,\u201d Boeing said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThese claims are inaccurate.\u201d  It also disputed Salehpour\u2019s concerns about the 787. \u201cThese claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate and do not represent the comprehensive work Boeing has done to ensure the quality and long-term safety of the aircraft,\u201d the company said in a statement. Gaps in the Dreamliner Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner planes, which entered service in 2011, could have 50-year lifespans \u2013 around 44,000 flights each, the company says. But Salehpour\u2019s complaint alleges crews assembling the plane failed to properly fill tiny gaps when joining separately manufactured parts of the fuselage.\u00a0That puts more wear on the plane, shortening its lifespan and risking \u201ccatastrophic\u201d failure, Salehpour\u2019s attorneys alleged. The allegations aren\u2019t entirely new: For nearly two years starting in 2021, the FAA and Boeing halted deliveries of the new Dreamliners while it looked into the gaps.\u00a0Boeing said it made changes in its manufacturing process, and deliveries ultimately resumed. \u201cWe incorporated the join inspection and verification activity into our production system so that airplanes coming off of the production line meet these specifications,\u201d Boeing said. The 787 Dreamliners were not grounded, but the FAA twice investigated questions about quality control during the jet\u2019s assembly process. The company maintained that the planes were and are safe to fly. Salehpour\u2019s attorneys said the FAA was surprised to discover through his complaint that the gaps were still an issue. \u201cI literally saw people jumping on the pieces of the airplane to get them to align,\u201d Salehpour said.\u00a0\u201cBy jumping up and down, you\u2019re deforming parts so that the holes align temporarily \u2026\u00a0and that\u2019s not how you build an airplane.\u201d Alleged retaliation led to another discovery Salehpour said Boeing retaliated against him after he raised another concern about the 787 and a different plane model. The whistleblower complaint said he pointed out to management the existence of drilling issues with the 787, and was then \u201cignored and ultimately transferred out of the 787 program to the 777 program.\u201d In his new role, Salehpour said he discovered subpar work with aligning body pieces, and pressure on engineers to green-light work they have not yet inspected. In all, Salehpour said the issues involve more than 400 777s and 1,000 787s. Boeing (BA) shares fell 2% Tuesday. This is a developing story. It will be updated.\ufeff",

            "text": "Delta Air Lines flyers will soon board its planes in a new way that might remind them of the past. Beginning May 1, the airline will board customers by numbered zones, a change that largely reverts back to process it used until early 2019, before changing to its current process of boarding by named categories (i.e. cabins, status and ticket types). Delta will maintain the same boarding order, but the categories will be called \u201czones,\u201d beginning with zone 1 and ending with zone 8. For example, \u201cPre-Boarding\u201d and \u201cFirst Class\u201d categories will be called zone 1, the \u201cComfort+\u201d category is being changed to zone 3 and the \u201cMain Cabin\u201d groups will now be grouped in zones 5 through 7, before ending with \u201cBasic Economy\u201d now in zone 8. The airline said in a statement that the new numbered boarding zones \u201cprovide customers with more clarity\u201d about the boarding process and will be used on all Delta flights. The new numbered zones will be printed on customers\u2019 boarding passes. End of a five-year system Next month\u2019s changes means the end of a five-year boarding process that Delta changed to board its plane on the branded fares that customers\u2019 purchased as part of an effort to bring \u201cconsistency, simplicity and clarity to the gate and boarding experience.\u201d It also introduced colors on gate screens and electronic boarding passes to the boarding process to help flyers identify their zone, which the airline will keep using. \u201cZone boarding, an aviation standard for decades, will soon be a thing of the past for Delta customers,\u201d the airline said in a 2018 release. It also expanded the number of boarding groups to \u201cencourage fewer customers to line up in the gate area at any one time.\u201d Delta will be keeping the same number of zones, too. Every minute counts when boarding Of course, any flyer knows that boarding is usually a chaotic process that no US carrier has exactly nailed down. United Airlines recently changed its boarding procedure for economy class passengers, with window seat passengers boarding first, followed by middle seat and then aisle seats. The airline said the process saves \u201cup to two minutes of boarding time.\u201d \u201cSaving even one minute in airplane turn time can sum up to several hundred million dollars per year for a large airline,\u201d John Milne of Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York, previously told CNN. Milne\u2019s co-authored more than 20 journal articles on the topic of airplane boarding. Milne says the time savings come down to better utilizing a key airline resource \u2013airplanes \u2013 adding \u201cparticularly large savings for an airline result when the boarding time reduction leads to offering an additional flight during the day.\u201d American Airlines switched to a nine-group boarding system in 2017 and made some tweaks to that system in 2023.

            "text": "Boeing\u2019s commercial jet orders bounced back in March, but it was due to a large order from American Airlines for a plane the Federal Aviation Administration hasn\u2019t even approved to carry passengers yet. American placed orders for 85 of the Boeing 737 Max 10, the largest version of that troubled aircraft. It also converted previous orders for 30 of the shorter Max 8 version of the plane, which is currently flying, into additional Max 10 orders. American also has options to buy another 75 Max 10s in the future. The order had been announced a month ago, and it was included in the March and first quarter sales and delivery report by Boeing on Tuesday. That report showed no other orders for any version of the 737 Max. Besides American\u2019s large Max order, Boeing also received orders for 28 of its widebody 777 jets during the month. But certification of the Max 10, which had been due to start flying passengers by this year, has been pushed back in the wake of the January 5 Alaska Airlines flight of a 737 Max 9, which had a door plug blow out, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Questions about anti-icing equipment on the Max engines would have required Boeing to get a waiver from the FAA to get the Max 10 and a smaller Max 7 model certified. But criticism of Boeing\u2019s safety and the quality controls in the wake of the Alaska Air incident prompted Boeing to withdrawal its request for a waiver, thus bringing the certification process to a temporary halt. The door plug incident prompted United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby to announce it was no longer counting on the 737 Max 10 planes it had already ordered from Boeing, saying the problem was the \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d for the airline\u2019s expectations for the plane. While it has yet to drop its orders for the Max 10, Kirby has said the airline is interested in possibly buying competing planes from Boeing rival Airbus. But it would likely be a much longer wait for United to get planes from Airbus due the backlog of orders the European aircraft maker has. Boeing had had a record month for commercial jet orders in December ahead of the Alaska Air incident, capping a strong year for sales overall. But its orders ground to a near halt in January after the January 5 flight, causing it to suffer its worst month for orders since the pandemic. While it bounced back to report 15 orders in February, that was far below Boeing\u2019s normal monthly volume. Thus, the order from American, which has its mainline fleet roughly split between Airbus and Boeing, was an important vote of confidence for the trouble aircraft maker. Orders for planes before certification are not unusual in the aerospace industry but not typically when there are questions about when the plane might be cleared to carry passengers. Boeing also reported it delivered only 24 of the 737 Max jets in the month, and five 787 Dreamliners. Its production of planes has been slowed by the questions about its quality controls since the Alaska Air incident as well, and the lack of deliveries has caused problems for some of its airline customers, including United Airlines, which has put a freeze on pilot hiring and asked some pilots to take voluntary unpaid leave. Southwest Airlines also reduced hiring plans, saying it will bring on 50% fewer pilots and 60% fewer flight attendants than planned this year due to Boeing cutting 737 Max deliveries to the airline by about 40%.",

The low-cost airline said it would defer the scheduled deliveries to 2030-2031. As a result of the deferrals, along with quality issues with engines made by supplier Pratt & Whitney,\u00a0Spirit\u00a0is furloughing pilots effective Sept. 1. Shares of\u00a0Spirit (SAVE)\u00a0rose about 5% in early trade. A snag with Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan engines has forced\u00a0Spirit\u00a0to ground some of its A320neo aircraft, pinching the company at a time when it is already grappling with a cash crunch. The agreement with Airbus would improve\u00a0Spirit\u2019s liquidity by about $340 million over the next two years, the carrier said, adding that there were no changes to its orders scheduled to be delivered during 2027-2029. \u201c[The] aircraft deferrals and pilot furloughs look positive, in terms of helping the carrier to reduce [or] defer some costs. However, among other factors, the carrier now potentially also reduces its revenue generation opportunities,\u201d Citi Research analyst Stephen Trent wrote in a note. Spirit, which has been losing money for several quarters despite strong travel demand, operates an all-Airbus fleet. As of December 2023, the company had a total of 205 Airbus jets. Spirit\u00a0now expects to end 2025 with a total of 219 jets in its fleet, with no additions of the A320neo aircraft. It had previously expected to add six A320neo jets in 2025 and increase its fleet to 234 jets. The furloughs \u201care deeply troubling for our entire pilot group,\u201d said Ryan Muller, chair of\u00a0Spirit\u2019s Master Executive Council at the Air Line Pilots Association. The council and a negotiating committee were exploring voluntary measures that could mitigate the necessity for, or the number of, required furloughs and downgrades, Muller added.",

            "text": "A sickening sense of deja vu flooded over Barb Handley and her siblings as news of the midflight blowout of an Alaska Airlines plug door \u2013 and the gaping hole it left behind \u2013 emerged in January. Images of the refrigerator-sized void conjured up heart-wrenching memories of the death of their mother, who in 1989 was among nine passengers blown out of a United Airlines Boeing 747 when its cargo door blew open over the Pacific Ocean, taking with it a large chunk of the cabin wall. \u201cIt felt like seeing the hole through which I was visualizing my mother being thrown out a plane,\u201d Handley said of the Alaska Airlines blowout in January, which happened on a Boeing 737 Max 9. Handley has flown countless times since her mother\u2019s death and has never been able to shake her nervousness. But the January blowout \u2013 and a string of recent mishaps involving Boeing jets \u2013 has ratcheted her anxieties to new levels. \u201cI know my brother and my sisters feel the same way,\u201d she said. \u201cYou wonder, \u2018Has there been enough due diligence with this individual plane, with this airline, with this manufacturer?\u2019 And those feelings are definitely heightened with the Boeing incidents.\u201d Though no passengers were killed during the Alaska Airlines incident, experts have said it could have been far more catastrophic. The chair of the National Transportation Safety Board has warned that \u201csomething like this can happen again.\u201d The two seats closest to the door plug were thankfully unoccupied, yet the blowout caused an air pressure loss severe enough to rip a boy\u2019s shirt off and twist the seats\u2019 metal frames toward the opening. An early assessment from the NTSB found that Boeing may have left critical bolts off the jet. The blowout is among a handful of harrowing air travel incidents that have contributed to a growing sense of unease among some travelers, including a violent plunge that sent passengers slamming into the ceiling of a Boeing Dreamliner jet last month and a case of severe turbulence that required several people to be taken to the hospital. A parade of less severe mishaps has also captured attention. The Federal Aviation Administration is taking a close look at United Airlines after nearly a dozen incidents so far this year \u2013 all on Boeing jets \u2013 including a missing external panel, flames shooting from an engine after takeoff and a wheel popping off. The string of incidents has led sisters Cara and Erin Ashcraft, who survived a fatal 1999 plane crash, to seriously second-guess air travel for the first time in years. \u201cWe have both flown many times since the crash, but for the first time in my life, I\u2019m actually afraid I could be in another crash again,\u201d Cara said in response to CNN\u2019s call for readers\u2019 input on air travel. The sisters were 10 and 13 years old when their plane overran a runway and crashed in Little Rock, Arkansas, killing 11 people and seriously injuring most other passengers. Both sisters recovered from serious burns from a fire that erupted during the crash and vowed not to let the terrifying incident prevent them from traveling. \u201cReally, the only reason we\u2019re able to get on the flight is because we trust the thousands of people involved from the beginning \u2013 from funding and designing the plane to building it and operating it. We expect that they\u2019ve done their jobs and that they\u2019re putting safety first,\u201d Cara Ashcraft told CNN. After seeing the slew of aircraft issues and increased federal oversight, she said, \u201cThat trust gets damaged.\u201d \u2018Erosion of public trust\u2019 More than 100 people responded to CNN\u2019s call for reader input, and many of them detailed their burgeoning unease with air travel during the recent spate of incidents. Many said they have begun to avoid flying Boeing aircraft, in some cases rethinking their long-held loyalties to airlines with Boeing-heavy fleets. Several said they now avoid sitting in coveted window and exit row seats out of concern for another incident like the Alaska Airlines blowout. And some expressed frustration that easing their concerns sometimes requires purchasing more costly tickets or avoiding travel altogether.  Others, however, said they are still confident in flight safety, pointing out that commercial air travel remains one of the safest modes of transportation. The last major fatal commercial plane accident in the United States was in 2009, and between 2010 and 2022, there have been only five commercial flight accident deaths. Last year, international commercial aviation boasted a record low fatality risk, with a person needing to travel by air every day for 103,239 years on average to experience a fatal accident, according to the International Air Transport Association\u2019s annual safety report. But even as the risk of a commercial plane crash is low, the Ashcraft sisters and other readers expressed concern that other in-air events such as severe turbulence could be traumatizing and have already begun to chip away at their trust in air travel safety. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that people should never fly again or I won\u2019t ever fly again,\u201d Erin Ashcraft said. \u201cBut I think that the erosion of public trust is a huge issue.\u201d \u2018I\u2019ve never had concerns before. This is new\u2019 Trey Smith has long relied on United Airlines for his monthly work trips out of Virginia, often catching up on sleep while in the air. But the series of incidents on United aircraft in recent months has made him increasingly restless on flights and led him to reconsider his preferred airline. \u201cI\u2019ve never had concerns (about air travel safety) before. This is new,\u201d Smith told CNN. During recent flights, Smith said he has begun to use United\u2019s flight-tracking app to monitor the aircraft\u2019s path and altitude for any sign of a disturbance. He has also been delaying planning a trip with his wife and four daughters because he\u2019s nervous about bringing his children on a plane. \u201cTraveling was fun once upon a time, but now it\u2019s more it\u2019s more scary and worrisome,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie, I pray more now before we take off and before we land.\u201d Smith believes airlines should disclose an aircraft\u2019s maintenance and inspection records to travelers so they can make \u201can educated decision\u201d about their flight and the aircraft. United has made efforts to reassure passengers such as Smith after the incidents on its Boeing jets, which made up about 80% of the airline\u2019s mainline operation fleet as of the end of last year. United CEO Scott Kirby said in a message to customers last month that the incidents \u201chave our attention and have sharpened our focus\u201d and that safety is \u201cat the center of everything that we do.\u201d Soon after, in a memo announcing the FAA\u2019s increased attention on the airline\u2019s safety procedures, United told its employees, \u201cThe number of safety-related events in recent weeks have rightfully caused us to pause and evaluate whether there is anything we can and should do differently.\u201d A mother who feels \u2018powerless\u2019 trying to avoid Boeing Aubrey, a mother who lives in Los Angeles with her husband and 5-year-old daughter, recognizes that air travel is still generally safe but doesn\u2019t feel confident bringing her daughter on Boeing aircraft given years of troubling incidents, particularly on the 737 Max, which has seen two fatal crashes outside the United States since 2018. But she said she has begun to feel \u201cpowerless\u201d as she plans a family trip to see loved ones on the East Coast and has struggled to find a flight on non-Boeing aircraft that fits her family\u2019s schedule and isn\u2019t \u201cexorbitantly expensive.\u201d Even if she does find a flight on an Airbus, the airline could change the aircraft model before the flight. In that case, she said, \u201cAirlines make it so difficult and costly to change a flight that I feel we\u2019d have no choice but to go ahead with the trip if our plane got changed to a Max at the last minute.\u201d \u201cYou want to be able to make a statement as a consumer that you don\u2019t want to use a certain product, and it\u2019s frustrating when you feel like you can\u2019t avoid it,\u201d said Aubrey, who asked that her last name be omitted because of privacy concerns. Though a crash is unlikely, she is concerned for her daughter\u2019s safety if there is a severe turbulence event such as those that have left passengers injured on flights operated by Southwest, Delta Air Lines and Hawaiian Airlines, among others. \u201cI hate that I\u2019m now having to consider what type of plane it is. And I\u2019m very resentful that I don\u2019t feel that Boeing has shown proper remorse for the accidents. I don\u2019t trust that they\u2019re actually taking the steps necessary to make this safer.\u201d So really, how safe is it to fly? Though flying is far safer than other modes of travel, aviation experts have mixed opinions on whether consumers have reason to be concerned. \u201cIf you look at the numbers, you\u2019re more at risk to have an accident driving to the airport than you are flying at 38,000 feet. I tell people, if you make it to your flight, the most hazardous part of your day is actually behind you,\u201d Anthony Brickhouse, a professor of aviation safety at Florida\u2019s Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, told CNN last month. Passengers, he added, should focus less on the aircraft they\u2019re boarding and more on making sure they comply with safety procedures on board. The Alaska Airlines Max 9 blowout is being investigated by the US Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, Brickhouse noted. The fact that the aircraft is\u00a0back in the air\u00a0means they have completed whatever inspections were necessary to ensure it is as safe as possible, he said. Despite the statistics, Ed Pierson, the director of the Foundation for Aviation Safety and a harsh critic of Boeing, told CNN previously that he won\u2019t fly on the Boeing 737 Max out of concern over the aircraft manufacturer\u2019s quality control standards. However, other aircraft \u2013 even older Boeing models \u2013 aren\u2019t off limits. \u201cTaking the Max out of the equation, (flying has) been proven to be pretty darn safe,\u201d he said last month. Pierson is wary of attitudes around the apparent safety of American air travel, he said. Such thinking may prevent necessary improvements from being made. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of overconfidence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gold standard is melting down, because we continue to try to downplay everything and talk about how safe the system is. That\u2019s not the right mindset. That\u2019s the mindset that gets people killed.\u201d Even as the US commercial aviation industry has gone more than a decade without a major fatal crash, there have been narrowly averted disasters on the ground. In July 2017, an Air Canada jet piloted by a captain who had been awake for more than 19 hours\u00a0nearly landed on a taxiway\u00a0at San Francisco International Airport where three wide-body jets filled with passengers were waiting to take off. The NTSB later said more than 1,000 people on the four planes might have died had the plane not diverted at the last moment. Though Brickhouse is fairly confident in the aviation system\u2019s safety, he didn\u2019t dismiss those who are fearful or who might want to avoid aircraft such as the 737 Max, noting he has his own concerns about things such as the number of narrowly avoided accidents at the nation\u2019s airports. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in luck, but we are fortunate that these incidents did not turn into disasters,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have a trend that keeps occurring, you need to focus on fixing it.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore and Jacopo Prisco contributed to this report.",

            "text": "Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun was awarded a giant stock bonus on top of his more-than-a-million-dollar salary last year, despite overseeing a company that has been plagued by chronic losses and safety problems. Calhoun\u2019s total compensation in 2023 was $32.8 million, a 45% increase from the $22.6 million he received for 2022. And it could have been a lot more: He declined to accept his annual incentive bonus of $2,800,000 \u2013 a request the board said he made after part of a Boeing 737 Max plane blew off the side of an Alaska Airlines flight in January, kicking off a series of federal investigations, a temporary grounding, executive ousters and another embarrassing public relations blunder for the company. Boeing enjoyed improved financial results in 2023 from Calhoun\u2019s first two years running the troubled aircraft manufacturer. It continued to lose money as it has every year since 2019, but it trimmed those losses by 60%, reporting a core operating loss of $1.8 billion. Its stock gained 37% during the year, and it had a record month for new commercial jet orders in December, giving it one of its best sales years ever, as airlines were eager for new jets to meet strong demand for travel. But after the January 5 door plug blowout, causing a gaping hole in the side of the jet, Boeing\u2019s reputation for safety and quality may have reached an all-time low. A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the plane had left a Boeing factory two months before the incident missing the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place. Calhoun told investors in January that \u201cwe caused the problem, and we understand that. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.\u201d Last month, Calhoun announced he would be retiring later this year and that the company had launched a search for a new CEO. Calhoun turns 67 later this month, and Boeing\u2019s board had actually moved back the retirement age for CEOs by five years to keep him in place. Upon his retirement, Calhoun is set to take home a giant going-away present: a $45 million mix of stock awards and options that vest over time. That\u2019s on top of whatever salary and bonus he may earn this year \u2013 although it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Boeing\u2019s board vastly reduces his 2024 pay, and perhaps his retirement awards, because of the state he has left the company in as CEO. Boeing did not respond to a request for comment. Calhoun became CEO in January of 2020, in the midst of a 20-month grounding of the 737 Max that followed two fatal crashes that killed 346 people in late 2018 and early 2019. Almost immediately Boeing and the aviation industry was hit by a near halt in air travel caused by the pandemic, which caused demand for planes to come to a near halt. In April of that year Calhoun suspended his base pay. But stock and other compensation he had already received when taking the job brought his 2020 total compensation to $21.7 million. It climbed slowly steadily in the two subsequent years, bringing his total compensation to $64.6 million heading into 2023.",

            "title": "JetZero: Groundbreaking \u2018blended-wing\u2019 demonstrator plane cleared to fly",
            "text": "The basic design of commercial airplanes hasn\u2019t changed much in the past 60 years. Modern airliners like the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350 have the same general shape as the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8, which were built in the late 1950s and solidified the \u201ctube and wing\u201d form factor that is still in use today. This is because commercial aviation prioritizes safety, favoring tried-and-tested solutions, and because other developments \u2014 in materials and engines, for example \u2014 mean the traditional design is still relevant. However, a seismic shake-up is about to take place. An entirely new aircraft shape has been cleared to take off into California skies. At the end of last month, Long Beach-based JetZero announced that Pathfinder, its 1:8 scale \u201cblended wing body\u201d demonstrator plane, has been granted an FAA Airworthiness certificate and test flights are imminent. As the industry desperately looks for ways to reduce carbon emissions, it faces a somewhat tougher challenge than other sectors precisely because its core technologies have proven so hard to move away from. It\u2019s a ripe time to innovate. The \u201cblended wing body\u201d looks similar to the \u201cflying wing\u201d design used by military aircraft such as the iconic B-2 bomber, but the blended wing has more volume in the middle section. Both Boeing and Airbus are tinkering with the idea, and JetZero\u2019s new milestone brings it a little closer to its ambitious goal of putting into service a blended wing aircraft as soon as 2030. \u201cWe feel very strongly about a path to zero emissions in big jets, and the blended wing airframe can deliver 50% lower fuel burn and emissions,\u201d Tom O\u2019Leary, co-founder and CEO of JetZero, told CNN in August 2023. \u201cThat is a staggering leap forward in comparison to what the industry is used to.\u201d Under pressure The blended wing concept is far from new, and the earliest attempts at building airplanes with this design date back to the late 1920s in Germany. American aircraft designer and industrialist Jack Northrop created a jet-powered flying wing design in 1947, which inspired the B-2 in the 1990s. As a sort of hybrid between a flying wing and a traditional \u201ctube and wing,\u201d the blended wing allows the entire aircraft to generate lift, minimizing drag. NASA says that this shape \u201chelps to increase fuel economy and creates larger payload (cargo or passenger) areas in the center body portion of the aircraft.\u201d The agency has tested it through one of its experimental planes, the X-48. Over about 120 test flights between 2007 and 2012, two unmanned, remote-controlled X-48s demonstrated the viability of the concept. \u201cAn aircraft of this type would have a wingspan slightly greater than a Boeing 747 and could operate from existing airport terminals,\u201d the agency says, adding that the plane would also \u201cweigh less, generate less noise and emissions, and cost less to operate than an equally advanced conventional transport aircraft.\u201d In 2020, Airbus built a small-blended wing demonstrator, about six feet in length, signaling interest in pursuing a full-size aircraft in the future. But if the shape is so effective, why haven\u2019t we yet moved to building planes based on it? According to O\u2019Leary, there is one main technical challenge holding manufacturers back. \u201cIt\u2019s the pressurization of a non-cylindrical fuselage,\u201d he says, pointing to the fact that a tube-shaped plane is better able to handle the constant expansion and contraction cycles that come with each flight. \u201cIf you think about a \u2018tube and wing,\u2019 it separates the loads \u2014 you have the pressurization load on the tube, and the bending loads on the wings. But a blended wing essentially blends those together. Only now can we do that with composite materials that are both light and strong.\u201d Such a radically new shape would make the interior of the plane look and feel wildly different to today\u2019s widebody aircraft. \u201cIt\u2019s just a much, much wider fuselage,\u201d O\u2019Leary says. \u201cYour typical single-aisle plane has three by three seats, but this is a sort of a shorter, wider tube. You get the same amount of people, but you might have 15 or 20 rows across the cabin, depending upon how each particular airline will configure it. \u201cThis just gives them a whole new palette with which to lay it out. I think it\u2019s going to be amazing to see what their interpretation of this much broader space will be.\u201d Revolutionary potential O\u2019Leary says that the nearest equivalent in terms of size would be the Boeing 767 \u2013 a widebody, twin-engine plane introduced in the 1980s that typically carried around 210 passengers. It\u2019s still produced as a cargo plane but was replaced by the Boeing 787 as a passenger aircraft. It also has a modern military variant, the KC-46, which the US Air Force uses for aerial refueling. Similarly, JetZero wants to simultaneously develop three variants: a passenger plane with seating for 200-plus passengers, a cargo plane and a fuel tanker. The blended wing shape lends itself so well to the latter that last year the US Air Force awarded JetZero $235 million to develop a full-scale demonstrator and validate the performance of the blended wing concept.\u00a0 The military version of the plane is scheduled to lead the way and perhaps support the development of the commercial models. The newly FAA-approved Pathfinder, with its 23-foot wingspan, is a 12.5%-scale version of the full-scale demonstrator, which is expected to take flight by 2027. The plane is designed for 100% compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and to have the internal volume to accommodate zero-carbon emissions hydrogen. However, building an entirely new airplane from scratch is an enormous task, and JetZero\u2019s targets sound ambitious, given that the full process of certification for even a variant of an existing aircraft can take years. One advantage JetZero has in this area is that the plane will initially borrow engines from today\u2019s narrowbody aircraft, like the Boeing 737 \u2014 although the plan is to eventually move to completely emission-free propulsion powered by hydrogen, which would require new engines that haven\u2019t yet been developed. JetZero hasn\u2019t announced any orders for its plane, but O\u2019Leary told CNN last year that airlines are interested. \u201cWe\u2019re talking to all the major airlines globally already, because they\u2019re excited to hear about the efficiency gains.\u201d It remains to be seen whether a 50% reduction in fuel use is actually possible. Both NASA and Airbus quoted a more modest 20% for their designs, while the US Air Force says a blended wing aircraft could \u201cimprove aerodynamic efficiency by at least 30% over current Air Force tanker and mobility aircraft.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that while a blended wing body can reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency, the actual benefits depend on the specific design, configuration, and operational conditions,\u201d says Bailey Miles, an aviation analyst at consulting firm AviationValues. \u201cExtensive aerodynamic testing and optimization are essential to fully realize the drag reduction potential of this innovative aircraft design. It would be hard to determine a specific percentage fuel reduction without the necessary tests,\u201d he adds. According to \ufeffMiles, the blended wing design is a \u201crevolutionary\u201d idea that has potential, but it comes with a number of hurdles, specifically an increased aerodynamic complexity that can make design and testing tricky, a series of regulatory and certification challenges, and a shape that may not be suitable for existing airport infrastructure. \u201cThe blended wing body aircraft holds immense promise as a game changer in the aviation industry, offering the potential for improved fuel efficiency, enhanced payload capacity, and innovative control systems. However, addressing the aerodynamic complexities, ensuring structural integrity, navigating regulatory hurdles, and adapting airport infrastructure are formidable challenges that must be overcome for it to become a reality,\u201d he says, adding that these challenges, among others, make JetZero\u2019s target of 2030 for entry into service \u201cinconceivable.\u201d According to Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at consulting firm Aerodynamic Advisory, while not all of JetZero\u2019s claims can be verified, \u201cthe idea of a blended wing body has been quite appealing for years, and it sounds like they\u2019ve done some very interesting research. My colleagues and I regard it as quite promising.\u201d He is concerned that the firm is mostly \u201ca design shop\u201d at the moment, but he believes that the project may take off with the help of contractors. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly room for somebody who actually wants to add value in this industry,\u201d he says.",

            "text": "In 1995, metallurgy graduate Wang Chuanfu founded BYD, a small Chinese company focused on producing rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries more cheaply than Japanese competitors. Nearly 30 years later, the Shenzhen-based firm has become the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of electric vehicles (EVs), even surpassing American giant Tesla (TSLA) in global sales of pure-play electric cars in the last quarter of 2023. But the two companies are still running neck and neck, with Tesla regaining its crown in the first quarter of 2024. Here\u2019s how they compare, in four charts: Most valuable carmakers Tesla stock was priced at $17 a share when it listed in June 2010. Nearly 14 years later, the company\u2019s shares trade above $166, giving it a market capitalization of about $560 billion, making it the most valuable car company in the world. It\u2019s also among the biggest companies globally by market value. As for BYD, its $81 billion market cap places it among the top 10 automakers in the world, according to Murthy\u00a0Grandhi, business fundamentals analyst at GlobalData, a data and analytics company in London. Still, it trails far behind Tesla and other car makers like Toyota (TM) and Stellantis (STLA), a conglomerate created from the 2021 merger of French PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The group sells cars under 14 brands, including Chrysler, Citro\u00ebn, Jeep, Maserati and Peugeot. But BYD has already surpassed BMW and Ford (F) and is catching up to Mercedes-Benz and Ferrari (RACE). In 2023, Tesla sold around 230,000 more cars than BYD. But the gap has been narrowing from 400,000 in 2022 and 600,000 in 2021. And in the last quarter of 2023, BYD hit a major milestone: selling more battery electric vehicles (BEVs) than Musk\u2019s company did globally, due in part to a slowdown for Tesla in one of its biggest markets, China, and to a general deceleration in demand for EVs. However, the Chinese company stumbled in early 2024. It sold only 300,114 BEVs in the first quarter, down from the 525,409 it sold in the final three months of last year. That drop was big enough for Tesla, which sold 386,810 BEVs in the same period, to retake its former position despite posting plunging sales. Slashing prices BYD\u2019s competitive pricing has helped propel its rise to the top of EV charts, especially compared to Tesla\u2019s pricier cars. But for both, competition in the world\u2019s largest car market is heating up. On March 4, BYD launched a new version of one of its best-selling models, the Yuan Plus crossover, known as Atto 3 outside China, and slashed the price of its predecessor by 11% to 119,800 yuan ($16,644). A few days later, BYD also cut the cost of the newest version of its cheapest car, the Seagull, by 5%. It now has a starting price under $10,000. Although Tesla also cut prices on some models in China last year, the Model 3 and Model Y still sell for more than double BYD\u2019s prices. China is Tesla\u2019s biggest market after the United States and accounted for 33% of global sales in 2023, according to UK-based consultancy firm Rho Motion. The American company started production at its Shanghai Gigafactory in 2019. Last year, that facility, which is Tesla\u2019s main export hub, delivered 947,000 cars. BYD doesn\u2019t sell cars in the United States although it does have a bus manufacturing plant in California. Both Tesla and BYD are expanding beyond their home markets and investing in factories abroad. Going global In 2023, a total of 13.6 million EVs (including BEVs and hybrids) were sold worldwide, an increase of more than 30% over the previous year.\u00a0The Chinese market grew by around 30% last year with 7.9 million units sold. Similar growth is anticipated in 2024, with sales expected to reach 10 million in China alone, says Rho Motion. BYD sold about 3 million electric cars, including hybrids, in 2023 globally. Of that number, 1.6 million were BEVs. By comparison, Tesla, which does not sell hybrids, delivered a total of 1.8 million vehicles worldwide last year, which was about 19% of the global market for BEVs. The United States and Canada bought around 700,000 of Tesla\u2019s vehicles, while 600,000 were sold in China. European sales accounted for about 400,000 vehicles. Tesla\u2019s shares are down 29% so far this year, while BYD stock is down almost 6%.",

Blinken and other State Department officials who are in Europe for talks about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza were forced to ride by car between Paris and Brussels Wednesday because the Air Force C-40 jet, a modified version of the Boeing 737 used commercial airlines, developed unspecified problems, according to the press pool traveling with him. Blinken travels on aircraft from the Air Force fleet. The top US diplomat arrived without incident to the Belgian capital for a meeting of the NATO foreign ministers. This is the second time this year that Blinken has had an issue with a Boeing plane while traveling. In January, when Blinken was about to return from Switzerland, the same model of plane\ufeff suffered what the traveling press was told was a critical failure related to an oxygen leak, and he was forced to fly home in a smaller jet. Boeing has been facing increased scrutiny since a door plug on a 737 Max blew off on an Alaska Airlines flight on January 5, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane that subsequently landed safely without any significant injuries. The National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s preliminary investigation found that jet left a Boeing factory in October without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place. The incident has sparked numerous investigations into the Boeing\u2019s practices and public attention to a large number of other problems on subsequent flights with Boeing jets. Many of those came on older planes and issues, which typically would have not been reported, were likely not caused by anything Boeing did. But the subsequent incidents, which typically would have not been reported by the media, have focused more attention on questions about the quality and safety of Boeing jets.",

            "title": "Biden administration set to greenlight $18 billion sale of F-15 fighter jets to Israel",
            "text": "The Biden administration is close to approving the sale of as many as 50 American-made F-15 fighter jets to Israel, in a deal expected to be worth more than $18 billion, according to three people familiar with the matter. The transaction, which would amount to the largest US foreign military sale to Israel since the country went to war with Hamas on October 7, comes as the administration is also expected to notify Congress soon of a large new sale of precision-guided munitions kits to Israel, the people said. The new sales of some of the US\u2019 most sophisticated weaponry underscore the extent to which the US continues to support Israel militarily, even as Biden administration officials criticize Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza, which have killed more than 32,000 Palestinians since October, according to the Gaza ministry of health. The sale is likely to be hotly debated in Congress, particularly by members of the president\u2019s own party. US weapons sales to Israel have come under intense scrutiny in recent months and Democratic lawmakers have called for restricting military aid to Israeli until it allows more humanitarian aid into Gaza and does more to protect civilians there. Since Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel in October, which killed over 1,200 Israelis, the US has made more than 100 foreign military sales to Israel. Most of those have fallen under the specific dollar amount that requires a notification to Congress, an official familiar with the matter previously told CNN. But an $18 billion F-15 sale is large enough that it requires congressional notification, and the administration informally notified the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations committees of the F-15 sale in late January, according to two of the people familiar with the matter. The informal notification gives lawmakers and congressional staff time to review the details and ask questions before the State Department sends a formal notification to all lawmakers. The top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. James Risch, has already given his approval on the sale, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.\u00a0A congressional aide told CNN that House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul has also approved the transaction to proceed to formal congressional notification. But Sen. Ben Cardin, the Democratic chairman of the committee, as well as the Democratic ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs committee, Rep. Greg Meeks, can still hold up the sale if they raise objections. If there are no objections, the State Department will send a formal notification to all lawmakers, who will then have 30 days to block the sale via a joint resolution of disapproval. Congress has never successfully blocked a proposed arms sale through such a resolution, which has to be passed by both chambers, according to the Congressional Research Service. There are also growing concerns among Democrats over the Biden administration\u2019s continued practice of sharing intelligence with Israel, which was expanded on President Joe Biden\u2019s orders in the wake of the October 7 attack by Hamas. Some of that intelligence support has been in the form of so-called raw intelligence that Israel is meant to use to locate hostages, but could also be used to identify Hamas targets, some sources told CNN. Hamas fighters are often embedded in civilian areas, officials have said. Meanwhile, a growing number of\u00a0US diplomats are becoming frustrated over the administration\u2019s reluctance to use its leverage over Israel to change their approach to the ongoing war. \u201cWhat you hear about the frustrations within the administration over the Israel policy, it is real,\u201d one US diplomat told CNN on condition of anonymity. \u201cWe are being asked to act in a way that ignores what we are seeing on the ground.\u201d The diplomats also told CNN they were frustrated with the administration\u2019s attempts to downplay the US abstention from a UN vote last week on a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. What could have been a bold message to Israel was diluted by the US insisting the resolution was non-binding and consistent with existing US policy, these diplomats said. These disaffected diplomats said they would like to see the US threaten future arms sales to Israel to help curtail the bloody fighting, but the proposed F-15 and precision-guided munitions sales indicate that the administration is not planning to restrict military assistance any time soon. F-15s won\u2019t be delivered immediately Unlike the precision guided munitions, the new F-15s would need to be built from scratch.\u00a0A US official said there are no plans to expedite delivery of the jets to Israel so, if approved, they would not be delivered to Israel for at least five years. Israeli officials have been urging the US to expedite the timeline if possible, CNN previously reported. Along with up to 50 individual jets, the package also includes engines, gun systems, radars and navigation systems for the jets, three of the sources said. The package provides construction and contractor support and logistical infrastructure for training, sustainment, and maintenance of the fleet, as well as a mid-life update for Israel\u2019s current fleet of F-15s. A State Department spokesperson said, \u201cWe are unable to confirm potential or pending US arms transfers before they are formally notified to Congress.\u201d The Biden administration also quietly authorized a sale of F-35 fighter jets to Israel last week, the sources said. That sale did not require congressional notification because the intended sale was already notified to Congress in 2008. The State Department spokesperson said that \u201cas a matter of practicality, major procurements, like Israel\u2019s F-35 program for example, are often broken out into several cases over many years.\u201d Sources told CNN that it was unclear why the Biden administration would approve such a large sale now, during an election year when the president\u2019s policy towards Israel is under a microscope. The sale is not particularly urgent, given that Israel won\u2019t be getting the jets for another few years, anyway. Josh Paul, who worked in the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs for over a decade before resigning in October over the US\u2019 ongoing arms transfers to Israel, said the US clearly thinks Israel needs the equipment \u201cfor its long-term defense.\u201d \u201cBut there is a sense on Israel\u2019s side that right now the doors are wide open for anything they want, so this is the time to ask for it,\u201d he said. \u201cWho knows how long the barn doors will be open for?\u201d The Israeli Embassy in Washington, DC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN about the proposed sales. \u201cThe United States has a decades-long commitment to Israel\u2019s security,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday. \u201cIsrael is surrounded by entities that are sworn to its destruction, not just Hamas, but Iran and proxy groups that Iran sponsors, Hezbollah among them, who have repeatedly talked about their desire for the destruction of Israel. We believe Israel has every right to defend itself against those opponents.\u201d Growing concerns about US intelligence sharing When it comes to intelligence sharing with Israel, the US has offered the Israeli government a significant amount of processing capacity, according to two sources familiar with the matter \u2014 essentially, computing power that allows Israel to sift through mass amounts of intercepts, imagery and other raw intelligence to extract meaningful trends or insights. In theory, the intelligence community is not allowed to share information with partners that would be used to violate the international laws of armed conflict, and US officials insist that they are not giving Israel what\u2019s known as \u201ctargeting intelligence\u201d; in this case, intelligence used to target precise Hamas fighters or positions. Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in November that the US military is \u201cnot participating\u00a0in IDF target development,\u201d and that their involvement is solely intended to help find the hostages. But several sources familiar with US sharing efforts who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity said that is a distinction without a difference. Once the US provides a piece of intelligence to Israel, it has no control over how Israel combines it with other information, and there\u2019s nothing to stop Israel from using that information to target Hamas operatives, the sources said. \u201cIsrael provides assurances that operations making use of U.S. intelligence are conducted in a manner consistent with international law, including the Law of Armed Conflict, which calls for the protection of civilians,\u201d a senior intelligence official told CNN in response to questions about the intelligence sharing. The intelligence has continued to flow, sources said, even as the Biden administration has been pressing Israel to do more to prevent civilian casualties. \u201cAbsent stronger oversight, it is impossible to discern how allies and partners are using U.S. intelligence in military operations,\u201d Steven Katz, a former Army officer currently working as a civilian in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, wrote in a piece on the national security blog Just Security, advocating for greater congressional oversight of intelligence sharing. \u201cIn certain cases, the IC may be providing indirect support through intelligence sharing for partner operations conducted in a manner inconsistent with U.S. law and policy,\u201d he said. The State Department has a process in place to investigate reports that civilians have been killed by US weapons wielded by other nations, according to Katz, but no law exists requiring the intelligence community to track how US intelligence-sharing may contribute to civilian deaths. A provision in an annual intelligence bill now before Congress would require the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to submit an annual report to Congress detailing civilian casualties caused by foreign government operations in which US-shared intelligence played a \u201csignificant role.\u201d But that bill has yet to be passed. This story has been updated with additional reporting. ",

            "title": "Supersonic planes will replace conventional jets in our lifetime, says aviation CEO",
            "text": "Earlier this month, a demonstrator aircraft for what could be the first new civil supersonic plane to be launched since the 1960s took to the skies. It\u2019s a milestone moment in the highly anticipated new era of supersonic travel. The XB-1, a technology demonstrator aircraft built by Colorado-based Boom Supersonic, successfully completed its first test flight at the Mojave Air & Space Port in California, it was announced March 22. The XB-1 is the the world\u2019s first independently developed supersonic jet and paves the way for the development of Boom\u2019s commercial plane Overture. Now, 10 years after the Boom Supersonic project began in 2014, CEO Blake Scholl tells CNN Travel over video call, there are an exciting few months ahead. The \u2018hard part\u2019 is over \u201cI very much believe in the return of supersonic air travel, and ultimately to bring it to every passenger on every route. And that\u2019s not something that takes place overnight,\u201d says Scholl. \u201cThe hard part of building a supersonic jet is making something that\u2019s so sleek, and so slippery, take off and land safely.\u201d XB-1\u2019s first flight met all of its test objectives, including safely reaching an altitude of 7,120 feet (2,170 meters) and speeds of up to 238 knots (273 miles per hour). That\u2019s quite a bit below the altitudes reached by commercial airliners, which fly between 31,000 feet to 42,000 feet. As for Mach 1 \u2013 the speed of sound \u2013\u00a0 that\u2019s about 760 mph, depending on altitude and temperature. But the plan is for XB-1 to achieve that supersonic ambition pretty fast. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna be doing a whole series of flights \u2013 10 to 15 total \u2013 over the next five to seven months to break the sound barrier for the first time,\u201d says Scholl. Aerodynamics, materials, propulsion There have been only two civil supersonic planes: the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 and the British-French Concorde, which flew for the last time in October 2003, more than two decades ago. Now, the industry is abuzz with supersonic and hypersonic projects \u2013 from NASA and Lockheed Martin\u2019s \u201cquiet\u201d X-59 aircraft, which limits sonic boom, to Atlanta-based Hermeus, which this week unveiled its first flyable aircraft. \u201cThe advent of digital engineering is a huge enabler for why supersonic flight\u2019s coming back,\u201d explains Scholl. \u201cAerodynamics, materials, propulsion: Those are the big three areas where we\u2019ve made huge progress versus Concorde.\u201d Computational fluid dynamics Back in the 1960s, Concorde was developed in wind tunnels, which meant building costly physical models, running tests, then repeat. \u201cYou just can\u2019t test very many designs, when every iteration costs millions and takes months,\u201d explains Scholl. But Boom has perfected its aircraft\u2019s efficient, aerodynamic design using computational fluid dynamics, which \u201cis basically a digital wind tunnel. We can run the equivalent of hundreds of wind tunnel tests overnight in simulation for a fraction of the cost of a real wind tunnel test.\u201d XB-1 is made almost entirely from carbon fiber composites, selected for being both strong and lightweight. Augmented reality vision system Concorde famously reduced drag when reaching supersonic speeds by having a long, pointed nose on a hinge that tilted forward when taking off, landing and taxiing so the pilots could see the runway. \u201cToday, we have this amazing thing called a camera and a screen,\u201d says Scholl with a smile, when explaining XB-1\u2019s unique augmented reality vision system. Rather than needing a complex moveable nose and windscreen views, the craft instead makes use of two nose-mounted cameras, digitally augmented with altitude and flight path indications. \u201cIt\u2019s far better than the view ever was on Concorde,\u201d claims Scholl, and the augmented reality symbology will help pilots line up the target and achieve \u201ca beautiful landing every time.\u201d Fueled by SAF So, with the aviation industry having a target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, where does a supersonic plane whizzing round at twice the speed of modern, conventional jets fit into all this? Overture is designed to be powered by conventional jet engines and to run on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). We\u2019ve covered the so-far slow adoption of SAF before here on CNN Travel, and Scholl is well aware of its current problems. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough of it, and it costs too much, but it is scaling,\u201d says Scholl, but he reckons that one day it\u2019ll be used for all long-haul air travel. It\u2019s the \u201cfuture of aviation,\u201d he declares. The need for speed Scholl concedes that \u201cflying faster is inherently more energy intensive,\u201d but argues that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t have to choose between climate-friendly and passenger-friendly. In fact, we can accelerate the transition towards lower carbon transportation by making sure that the most desirable airplane is also the most climate-friendly.\u201d He compares today\u2019s transatlantic air travel to \u201cdriving across the Atlantic in a not-very-good SUV. Aboard Overture, driving across the Atlantic is gonna be like driving a Tesla across it. And yeah, it\u2019s gonna be more energy-intensive, but from a climate perspective, it doesn\u2019t matter because the energy source is green.\u201d \u2018If we have faster airplanes, we don\u2019t need as many\u2019 He also argues the case for other efficiencies offered by faster flight. \u201cA faster airplane is much more human-efficient, and it\u2019s much more capital-efficient. You can do more flights, with the same airplane and crew,\u201d says Scholl. \u201cWe can significantly reduce all of the cost and impact that goes into airplanes by making them faster. if we have faster airplanes, we don\u2019t need as many.\u201d The reason we don\u2019t use propeller flights between London and New York, he says, is that while it might be less energy-intensive than a jet engine, it would be \u201cmore expensive and more impactful overall, because going at half the speed you would need way more.\u201d He predicts that, in the same manner jet airplanes replaced propeller airplanes, \u201cin your lifetime and mine, supersonic is going to replace today\u2019s jet airliners, and it\u2019s going to be both faster, more sustainable, and more affordable.\u201d \u2018Anywhere in the world in four hours for $100\u2019 Back when CNN Travel spoke with Scholl in May 2021, he told us his dream was for people to one day be able to \u201cfly anywhere in the world in four hours for $100.\u201d Three years later, he says it\u2019s still his \u201cNorth Star.\u201d \u201cIf you look back at Concorde, you know, built out of 1960s technology, this was like a 20,000 quid ticket, and it just wasn\u2019t attainable,\u201d says Scholl. On the first iteration of Boom\u2019s Overture plane, dubbed Overture One, \u201cour goal is to cut that by a factor of four, and be able to have supersonic flight available to the tens of millions of people who can fly business class today.\u201d The long-term vision is for later versions of Overture - there\u2019s plans for Overture Two, then Overture Three \u2013 will bring supersonic flights on more routes to more passengers at lower costs. Boom\u2019s goal is to cut flights to \u201chalf the time or less than it takes today.\u201d The ultimate goal is \u201cflights that are faster, more affordable, more convenient, more sustainable. And we\u2019re just gonna keep working on that until we can travel effortlessly around the planet.\u201d 2024 is \u2018one of the biggest years yet\u2019 Boom aims to carry its first passengers on Overture \u2013 between 64 and 80 of them, at Mach 1.7 \u2013 before the end of the decade.

            "text": "Shortly after taking over Boeing from\u00a0Dennis Muilenburg\u00a0\u2014 who was fired for abysmal performance following two fatal\u00a0737 Max 8\u00a0crashes \u2014\u00a0David Calhoun\u00a0said, \u201cWe had a backup plan. I am the backup plan.\u201d Now Boeing needs a backup to the backup. The foundations of Boeing and its culture have not improved enough under Calhoun\u2019s leadership. Monday\u2019s\u00a0announcement\u00a0that he would leave Boeing at the end of the year marks an important inflection point for the once-great aerospace company and an opportunity to change its direction. But an important question persists: Who should take over as CEO of Boeing? What does the portrait of an ideal leader for Boeing look like? At its foundation, the board of directors needs to select the new CEO based on three criteria: Boeing\u2019s new CEO needs to signal change, embody the company they want Boeing to become and be driven\u00a0by the goal of\u00a0leaving a positive legacy. Boeing\u2019s new CEO needs to signal change. Much like when the tech industry adopted the\u00a0hoodie to signal an intention to do things differently, the aerospace giant needs its own iconic look, and this could be its opportunity. When employees, regulators and the public meet the new CEO, they need to see change. Those characteristics could be the way the new CEO speaks, the way they look, the background they have, the way they dress or their attitude. The current baseline to overcome is easy to spot: an older corporate veteran from\u00a0General Electric with a degree in accounting wearing a black suit and tie. While it\u2019s easy to say that optics shouldn\u2019t matter, they do, and they can have a powerful effect. Imagine a 40-something nerdy engineer with a long-term orientation who is able to stand up to Wall Street and the board of directors to take the pressure off immediate performance. Boeing\u2019s new CEO needs to embody the company\u00a0the board wants Boeing to become. If the board of directors wants to see the same \u2014 a relentless focus on profitability,\u00a0$59 billion\u00a0returned to shareholders over a decade,\u00a0crashes, safety incidents\u00a0and disdain from the public \u2014 we know what that looks like. On the other hand, if the board wants the company to return to its image as an engineering and manufacturing powerhouse with an intense focus on innovation and quality, we also know what that looks like. That\u2019s an aerospace engineer who has designed planes, a mechanical engineer who has manufactured planes or a product quality manager who has inspected planes. That person\u00a0wants\u00a0to walk around the engineering labs, stroll the manufacturing floor, visit customers\u2019 airplane hangars and sit through quality meetings. They must be able to \u201cspeak\u201d engineering. With an engineering background, they would have the capability and the mandate to lead a change back to the company\u2019s roots and shrug off the short-termism that I believe is the source of its woes. This is not the time to hire an executive with experience in crisis management, cost accounting or political lobbying. This is a time to hire the leader who can actually lead a technology and manufacturing giant, not allow it to limp along from crisis to crisis. Boeing\u2019s new CEO needs to be driven by leaving a positive legacy, where the company is in a purposeful state and has the momentum to sustain its competitive advantage long after their departure. It\u2019s about the future success of the company, not\u00a0current gains. If the new CEO needs a blueprint of what their legacy could look like, they need only read up on the not-so-recent\u00a0history\u00a0of Boeing. They will read about massive technological advancements, deep manufacturing expertise and the ability to dream. The stories will describe senior managers walking the factory and engineering floors, all while being financially successful. Through Boeing\u2019s own history, they can envision a talented, excited employee base working together in open dialog to build iconic products. This CEO is out there. What I have described is not a corporate unicorn. The worst thing Boeing\u2019s board could do would be to settle on more of the same. The company and the public need change.",

            "text": "Since its founding by William Boeing more than a century ago, the Boeing Company has had 12 CEOs. The 13th might be the most important yet. As Boeing begins its search for a new CEO, the company is facing its worst-ever crisis. It has struggled through more than five years of safety incidents and bad news that  created unprecedented doubt about the quality of its aircraft. It faces multiple federal investigations into its commercial plane practices, as well as an outcry from the airline customers that buy its planes. In addition to two fatal crashes that cost 346 lives, the company has run up more than $31 billion in losses since 2019, with no end to the red ink in sight. It has grabbed unwanted attention with incidents like a blown-out door plug that left a gaping hole in an Alaska Airlines flight in January. Those incidents were followed by Monday\u2019s decision by the current CEO, Dave Calhoun, to step down by the end of the year, leaving the company to search for a new chief executive. What Boeing wants in its new CEO When picking a new CEO, the company likely has two pools of choices. It can go with someone who has an engineering background, as was the background of many of the past CEOs who led the company in its heyday. Four of the company\u2019s first five CEOs were engineers by training, running the company for 46 of the first 70 years of Boeing\u2019s existence. Or it can once again pick a leader like outgoing CEO Calhoun, who has a financial background and an undergraduate degree in accounting. Critics have said an increased focus on financial results over engineering excellence over the last 25 years has led to the company\u2019s current problems. Some say it\u2019s crucial that Boeing get back to its engineering roots in its next CEO. \u201cTo fix Boeing\u2019s issues the company needs a strong engineering lead as its head coupled to a governance model which prioritizes safety and quality,\u201d said Sir Tim Clark, president of Emirates Airlines, which ordered 373 planes from Boeing since 2009, but only two of those since 2019. \u201cWhether, yet again, this changing of the guard will resolve Boeing\u2019s issues only time will tell, but time, unfortunately, is not on their side.\u201d In an interview with CNBC on Monday morning, Calhoun was asked about what he wants to see in his successor. \u201cI want somebody who knows how to handle a big, long, long-cycle business like ours,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the production of the airplane. It\u2019s the development of the next airplane. It will be a $50 billion investment. I would like somebody who clearly has the experience inside our industry.\u201d Calhoun did not give any potential names, or say whether Boeing is looking more at internal or outside candidates. But a number of potential choices are surfacing, according to Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. Pat Shanahan Pat Shanahan is the \u201ctop of the list,\u201d according to Aboulafia. A former Boeing executive for 31 years, he became known as \u201cMr. Fix It\u201d at the company for dealing with various problems during his tenure. He was deputy secretary of the US Department of Defense under President Donald Trump and was nominated to be secretary, serving nearly six months in an acting capacity in 2019. His name was withdrawn before his confirmation due to media reports involving domestic incidents involving violent actions by his son and ex-wife. He has held a number of different posts in the years since, and in September became CEO of Boeing\u2019s major supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, which makes the fuselages for the Boeing 737 Max among other items. Spirit AeroSystems faces its own safety and quality issues, which have caused problems for Boeing, forcing temporary halts of production on some jets. But most of those problems occurred before Shanahan took the CEO job there. Boeing is in talks to reacquire Spirit, the companies confirmed, which would be something of a homecoming. Spirit was part of Boeing before the larger company spun it off in 2005. If Boeing acquires Spirit, it\u2019s possible Shanahan would be tapped as Boeing\u2019s next CEO as part of the merger. Most of the companies where candidates mentioned in this story now work declined to comment when questioned by CNN or did not respond to a request for comment. Spirit was the only one to comment, but it did not address the possibility of Shanahan becoming Boeing CEO. \u201cMr. Shanahan remains solely focused on driving a zero-defects culture across all aspects of Spirit AeroSystems,\u201d said Joe Buccino, a Spirit spokesperson. Larry Culp Larry Culp has already turned around one major American industrial icon, becoming  CEO of General Electric in 2018 and spinning off many of the company\u2019s parts. One of the parts that remains is GE Aerospace, which makes engines used on Boeing jets and other planes. Under its longtime CEO Jack Welch, GE grew to corporate success with a strong focus on cutting costs to improve financial performance. Three of the last four Boeing CEOs, including Calhoun, spent part of their careers at GE. Some Boeing critics say those CEOs\u2019 emphasis on the GE playbook of cost cutting, profitability and shareholders rewards rather than quality was the source of much of Boeing\u2019s current problems. But Culp has moved GE away from the Jack Welch era, a time when Calhoun and some of the other earlier Boeing CEOs cut their teeth, said Aboulafia. Culp joined GE as an outsider in 2018 after spending 24 years at Danaher Corp., moving up the ranks to CEO from 2000 to 2014. Many industrial analysts believe Danaher, during Culp\u2019s tenure, outperformed GE and many other manufacturing and industrial companies during that time. Culp has an undergraduate degree in economics and an MBA from Harvard, a business background more than an engineering background. \u201cI know he\u2019s done incredibly well at Danaher and GE. This is a new GE. Culp is being very open to being transformative,\u201d he said. \u201cThey needed to escape from that Jack Welch culture. What looks like a negative is actually a positive.\u201d GE did not comment when asked about whether Culp would be interested in the Boeing job. Kathy Warden Kathy Warden has had a lot of success as CEO of Northrop Grumman since she  began in the company\u2019s top job at the start of 2019. The military contractor\u2019s revenues have grown 30% during that period. Its stock price has nearly doubled under her tenure. And while Northrop doesn\u2019t make commercial jets, Boeing is also a major defense contractor in addition to a commercial aircraft maker. Warden has an MBA and worked at GE for a decade and two other industrial companies before joining Northrop. \u201cThat\u2019s a wonderful idea,\u201d Aboulafia said. \u201cI don\u2019t now how you\u2019d convince her to make that leap, but she\u2019d be perfect.\u201d One reason that the Boeing board might be interested in her, besides her success, is what\u2019s known as the \u201cglass cliff\u201d phenomenon, in which companies, especially those in male dominated fields like tech or manufacturing, are more open to looking at women CEOs when they\u2019re in trouble. Think of General Motors picking Mary Barra to be the first woman to run a major global automaker just before a major crisis \u2014 the ignition switch problem that killed more than 100 drivers and passengers and cost the company billions \u2014 became public. Sometimes the new woman CEO is not as successful as Barra in steering the company through the crisis, and thus a woman who has shattered the \u201cglass ceiling\u201d finds herself pushed off the \u201cglass cliff.\u201d Greg Smith Greg Smith left his post as CFO of Boeing soon after the company\u2019s board granted a five-year waiver of the normal retirement age limit of 65 to Calhoun in 2021. Smith, who was 54 at the time, clearly saw his path to the CEO job had been blocked. Since he left, he joined a number of corporate boards, most notably American Airlines, where he serves as chairman. RIght now, one of Boeing\u2019s biggest problems is relations with its airline customers, many of whom are frustrated with repeated missed deadlines to deliver new jets, groundings by regulators and for the quality of the jets it is delivering. One way for the Boeing board to signal it is listening to those customer concerns would be to name someone who now is on the airlines\u2019 side of that crucial relationship but who also has experience with Boeing. That describes Smith. But picking him would also mean another CEO with a finance background rather than an engineering background. Alan Mulally Aboulafia suggested there could be a number of executives who have left Boeing who might be good fits if they could come back, although their age could be an issue. At the top of that list is Alan Mulally. He was a long-time veteran of the Boeing Commercial Airplane unit, rising to be its CEO. He left Boeing in 2006 to become CEO of Ford. At the time, Ford was struggling more than the other Detroit automakers, GM and DaimlerChrysler, as Chrysler was then known. Mulally helped turn around the company, which allowed Ford to be the only Detroit automaker to avoid a federal bailout and bankruptcy, as GM and Chrysler experienced three years later. He retired from Ford in 2014 with a nest egg worth nearly $300 million thanks to the turnaround the stock experienced during his eight years on the job. Mulally has degrees in aeronautical engineering and in management. It\u2019s not clear if Mulally, now 78, would want to come out of retirement for a challenge as big as turning around Boeing. He did not respond to an email from CNN about the job on Monday. It\u2019s also not clear if the Boeing board would consider someone that old. But in a year in which the US presidential election appears likely to pit an 81-year old candidate versus a 77-year old candidate, it seems tough to argue a well respected 78-year-old is too old to run Boeing. Internal candidates Normally, internal candidates might be seen as the likely picks to replace Calhoun. Most of the 12 CEOs in Boeing\u2019s history were internal candidates, with Calhoun being an exception. However, the problems at Boeing during the last five years could lead the board to give preference to outside candidates. \u201cBoeing is in need of drastic cultural overall, which is\u00a0cultivated from the top, but sprouts from the bottom,\u201d said Bank of America aerospace analyst Ron Epstein in a note to clients Monday. \u201cWe see the changes [announced Monday] as the first right steps of removing the\u00a0\u2018old guard\u2019 and making way for a new team which can work from a less sullied slate.\u201d But among the internal candidates who might be considered are Stephanie Pope, who has been rising rapidly at Boeing and was promoted to chief operating officer just this past January. She was then promoted to CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes on Monday. Another internal candidate could be CFO Brian West, another GE veteran, having served as CFO of GE Aviation and CFO GE Engine Services before coming to Boeing. Both Pope and West come from a finance background, not an engineering background. It\u2019s also possible that Boeing could tap Elizabeth Lund, who is senior vice president of quality at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, a new position that was created just a month ago. She does have an engineering background and experience dealing with Boeing suppliers, a major issue for the company\u2019s efforts to get back on track. \u201cI don\u2019t know her, but she\u2019s well regarded,\u201d Aboulafia said. A Boeing spokesperson declined to provide any comments on behalf of any of the internal candidates.",

            "text": "The beauty of being a CEO in America is that when your company does well, you get extra money as a reward. And when your company does badly, you get extra money to encourage you to stick around and lead it through the storm. What a deal! And at some point, you get to bow out and float toward retirement on your golden parachute, which means \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 more money. That\u2019s the dream awaiting Dave Calhoun, the CEO of Boeing, who is preparing to retire after four years at the helm, during which he failed to fix the company\u2019s biggest problems around safety and quality control that burned its reputation with customers. By the time he steps down at the end of this year, he\u2019ll be 67 years old and poised to collect millions of dollars on top of the many millions he\u2019s already made as CEO. There\u2019s a certain dark irony in Calhoun pulling the metaphorical ripcord now, while Boeing is flailing, though it\u2019s hard to imagine a scenario in which he got to keep his job in the midst of cascading mishaps and near-disasters over the past three months. Exactly how much Calhoun will receive isn\u2019t clear yet, as it depends on how Boeing\u2019s stock performs. A Boeing spokesperson said that details of his compensation will be shared in company filings in the coming weeks. But we already know that Calhoun has made about $63 million over the past three years in total compensation, according to regulatory filings. That includes a $1.4 million base salary, plus millions in stock-based incentives. According to Boeing\u2019s most recent proxy statement, Calhoun is set to walk away with about $15 million worth of stock, cash and options in retirement. But that doesn\u2019t account for incentives along the way that could boost his potential future earnings. One estimate, according to Fortune, suggests Calhoun could walk away with $24 million, with the potential to collect $45.5 million more if Boeing\u2019s stock goes up 37%. That gives Calhoun a pretty hefty incentive to choose his successor carefully. If history is any guide, Calhoun could have done a much worse job and still made out startlingly well. His predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, was fired over his mishandling of Boeing\u2019s response to two crashes that killed 346 people. And while Muilenburg was denied severance pay, he still walked away with $80 million worth of stock and other assets. Post-Muilenburg, the board tapped one of their own to take over. Calhoun, an accountant by training and a longtime Boeing director, ascended as CEO in January of 2020 with a message that Boeing would be getting back to its roots and focusing on safety and quality. The honeymoon period didn\u2019t last long. Even as the board heaped praise on Calhoun, Boeing\u2019s own customers started sounding off about their frustrations with the leadership. In 2022, the CEO of Ryanair said \u201cBoeing management is running around like headless chickens,\u201d and that executives needed an immediate \u201creboot, or a boot up the a**.\u201d Around the same time, the head of aircraft leasing company Avalon said Boeing had \u201clost its way\u201d and might need\u00a0\u201cfresh leadership.\u201d Under Calhoun, labor relations at Boeing have been badly frayed. The company laid off at least 16,000 employees in response to the pandemic, and moved production of the 787 Dreamliner from its unionized plant in Washington to a non-unionized plant in South Carolina. This summer, more than 30,000 Seattle-area mechanics are set to vote on a strike authorization that could result in a work stoppage when their contract expires in September. Still, Calhoun has held on, thanks to a loyal board and a business model that makes it virtually impossible for Boeing to lose customers or go bankrupt. And once again, Boeing finds itself in a crisis, looking for a new leader to steer it to a safe landing. \u2014CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore contributed reporting.",

            "text": "The newly public company trading on the Nasdaq with the ticker \u201cDJT\u201d has one dominant shareholder: Donald John Trump, the cash-strapped former president of the United States. That a fledgling, unprofitable social media platform can make the former president billions of dollars on paper is a marvel of the stock market. Trump can\u2019t realize the windfall by selling his shares or borrowing against them for six months unless the company\u2019s board, which is packed with his supporters, gives him the OK. It probably can\u2019t get Trump cash soon enough to make the drastically reduced $175 million bond he needs to post for the civil tax fraud charges levied on him and his other companies. Other penalties in that civil fraud decision, including the suspension of Trump\u2019s ability to do business in New York, have been paused for now. The fact that Trump\u2019s newly public company makes little in the way of revenue and loses money should be fair warning to investors.\u00a0In the meantime, he\u2019s also trying to sell \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d Bibles via his social media platform Truth Social for $59.99. Unprofitable and losing users CNN\u2019s Matt Egan points out that the fundamentals of the company are not exactly stellar: \u201cTrump Media generated just $3.4 million of revenue through the first nine months of last year, according to filings. The company\u00a0lost $49 million over that span.\u201d \u201cMy podcast makes a lot more money,\u201d the tech journalist and CNN contributor Kara Swisher told Laura Coates on CNN on Monday. Plus, the company\u2019s main asset, Truth Social, has fewer than 500,000 monthly active users, far less than platforms like Facebook, X or TikTok, and Truth Social is losing more users than larger platforms and is losing users at a faster clip. More from Egan: \u201cFor context, Reddit was only valued at $6.4 billion\u00a0at its IPO last week\u00a0\u2013 even though it generated 160 times more revenue than Trump Media. (Reddit hauled in $804 million in revenue in 2023, compared with Trump Media\u2019s annualized revenue of about $5 million.)\u201d Who is invested? In the case of Trump, the stock could be inflated by his supporters, although the inverse could also true. If Trump unloaded his stock, it could plunge in value because his brand would no longer be associated with it. The top institutional investor in the company is Susquehanna International Group. Its founder, Jeff Yass, is a major donor to Republican causes and also a major investor in ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. Yass and Trump actually met recently, just before Trump reversed his previous position in favor of requiring ByteDance to spin off TikTok. Trump said the subject of TikTok did not come up in his conversation with Yass. Susquehanna International Group did not return a request for comment about the company\u2019s stake in Trump Media & Technology Group. Jordan Libowitz is the communications director for the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, and in a phone conversation, he wondered what might happen if foreign wealth funds that have interests in the US, like those associated with Saudi Arabia or Qatar, started buying large amounts of DJT stock. Since so much of Trump\u2019s wealth is now tied up in the company, those countries could theoretically have a direct impact on his bottom line. \u201cThe value isn\u2019t really in the company,\u201d Libowitz argued, pointing to the company\u2019s lackluster revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s in the Trump name.\u201d Clear ethical issues If Trump wins the White House again and a company bearing his initials are available, it could obviously be a venue for investors to curry favor. It would be an unprecedented situation, although not dissimilar to what happened when Trump was president. While his company was not public during his first term in the White House, the use of his then-Washington, DC, hotel by foreign companies was the subject of lawsuits related to the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause, which bars the president from profiting from a foreign government. Days after Trump left office, the Supreme Court threw out cases related to the Emoluments Clause because he was no longer in office. While Trump no longer owns the DC hotel, the same ethical issues would present themselves if he returns to the White House. But while the effect of throwing business to a president\u2019s hotel ends when someone checks out of their room, the relationship with investors can be much longer lasting. A history of bankruptcy Another note of caution for investors in DJT should the history of the last company Trump took public. Trump\u2019s casino company also went by the ticker DJT, but on the New York Stock Exchange between 1995 and 2004, when it went bankrupt and was delisted. That was actually the third of Trump\u2019s four business bankruptcies. Note: When Trump was talking about the IPO for Trump Media & Technology Group after a court appearance in New York on Monday, he tried to explain why the company would be listed on Nasdaq instead of the NYSE. CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale looked into that claim \u2013 something about how the NYSE is in New York \u2013 and found Trump\u2019s explanation to make no sense, since Nasdaq is also located in New York. Presidents are exempt from ethics law Current law restricts every executive branch employee except the president from having investments that conflict with their job, Kedric Payne, senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center, told me in a phone conversation. It\u2019s something Trump exploited when he said he gave control of his company, the Trump Organization, to his sons during his four years in the White House. Ethics experts balked at the lack of controls and transparency. \u201cIt\u2019s new facts, but the same old problem,\u201d Payne said, adding that the volume of money involved could be much greater with a publicly traded company. \u201cAny action that he takes as president could benefit that company, and he would then have the benefit of the stock price,\u201d Payne said. Shortly after he was elected in 2016, Trump noted that presidents are exempt from ethics laws. \u201cThe president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest,\u201d he told The New York Times. When these laws were written, according to Libowitz, nobody anticipated a president\u2019s name being attached to a large, publicly traded company. That doesn\u2019t mean previous presidents weren\u2019t wealthy, but unlike Trump, they walled their investments off. He\u2019s doing the opposite, making his wealth synonymous with his name and inviting investors. A new \u2018meme\u2019 stock? None of that has stopped what some experts have referred to as a bubble forming around the Trump Media & Technology Group. It is drawing comparisons to so-called \u201cmeme stocks\u201d like GameStop and AMC, which were buoyed for a time by small individual retail investors who poured in so much money that the stocks rapidly outran the companies\u2019 fundamentals.",

            "text": "Starting Tuesday, there\u2019s a new company on the Nasdaq:\u00a0Trump Media & Technology Group, which will trade under the stock ticker DJT. DJT, of course, stands for Donald John Trump, underscoring the company\u2019s raison d\u2019etre \u2014 giving a megaphone (and a serious cash infusion) to the presumptive Republican nominee. The company\u2019s main product, Truth Social, was Trump\u2019s quick and dirty solution to his ban on practically every mainstream social media app in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The social media app was never a blockbuster, though, and it\u2019s unclear how the company will ever make money. If that all sounds familiar, that\u2019s because we\u2019ve been down this road before. While Trump Media may be new, its stock ticker is a throwback to Trump\u2019s only other publicly traded company. Trump bestowed the same initials on his Atlantic City casino business, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, back when that company went public in 1995. It didn\u2019t go great. At least, not for investors. Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts never turned a profit and ended up in bankruptcy in 2004, wiping out shareholders. Trump\u2019s company lost money every single year of its existence, putting it more than $600 million in\u00a0the red \u2014 despite owning premier Atlantic City casinos, including the Trump Taj Mahal, a place so opulent Trump called it \u201cthe eighth wonder of the world.\u201d The stock lost 90% its value in its first five years as a public company. Yet Trump himself made out fine. Between 1995 and 2004, Trump took home about $40 million in salary, bonuses and options \u2014 not unusual for a CEO. Then there were the less common moneymaking methods, including consulting contracts, licensing deals and reimbursements for the use of his personal jet and golf courses. Those atypical payments made up about half of the money Trump made during his tenure as the company\u2019s leader. \u201cThe money I took out of there was incredible,\u201d Trump told the New York Times in 2016. Trump\u2019s stock holdings were wiped out in the bankruptcy. But he continued to make millions of dollars from the company after it came out of bankruptcy, pocketing $6.1 million from the re-named Trump Entertainment Resorts company, which traded under a new ticker \u2014 you guessed it! \u2014 TRMP. The new name and ticker didn\u2019t help the company, though. It lost $2 billion over five years and filed for bankruptcy a second time in 2009. Like its predecessor, the new DJT is enjoying some market enthusiasm following the merger between Trump\u2019s media entity and Digital World Acquisition Corp. Shares of DWAC surged 40% Monday and are up over 170% over the past six months. But a look at the fundamentals suggests the stock is wildly overvalued. Trump Media generated just $3.4 million of revenue through the first nine months of last year, according to\u00a0SEC\u00a0filings.  \u201cThe stock price is clearly a bubble,\u201d Yale law professor Jonathan Macey told my colleague Matt Egan last week. \u201cNo rational investor would take the stock at face value, especially if they had to hold it for any length of time.\u201d Meanwhile, Truth Social\u2019s user base is shrinking \u2013 more so than that of X, the company formerly known as Twitter. At current prices, Trump\u2019s stake is valued at about $4 billion. In theory, he\u2019s not allowed to sell that stock for several months after trading begins. But there could be workarounds to that so-called lock-up period, if the company\u2019s board of directors allow it. And the board may be more amenable to green-lighting that now that Trump\u2019s civil fraud bond obligation has shrunk by more than 60%. Trump would have to sell a much smaller sliver of his stake in Trump Media to cover his modified bond payment \u2014 $175 million, down from $454 million \u2014 to cover any shortfall. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Matt Egan contributed reporting.",

            "title": "Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun to step down in wake of ongoing safety problems",
            "text": "Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said Monday he intends to leave the beleaguered company by the end of the year in a major shakeup of the company\u2019s leadership. Boeing\u2019s chairman and the head of the commercial airplane unit are also leaving. Boeing\u2019s chairman, Larry Kellner, will not stand for re-election as a board director. The board has elected former Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf to succeed him. The company also announced that Stan Deal, CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, is retiring. Stephanie Pope, Boeing\u2019s chief operating officer since January, is taking his place effective immediately. Boeing has been buffeted by more than five years of problems with its airplanes, including two fatal crashes of the 737 Max in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people, and most recently a door plug that blew out of the side of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max in January, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. The problems have led to multiple groundings for safety issues and more than $31 billion in cumulative losses. In a letter to Boeing employees Monday, Calhoun called the Alaska Airlines incident \u201ca watershed moment for Boeing.\u201d \u201cThe eyes of the world are on us,\u201d he said in announcing his departure plans. \u201cWe are going to fix what isn\u2019t working, and we are going to get our company back on the track towards recovery and stability.\u201d The decision to leave was \u201c100%\u201d his choice, Calhoun said in an interview on CNBC Monday morning. But Calhoun has become the focus of many who are critical of the way Boeing has been run in recent decades and the string of safety and quality issues. \u201cHe\u2019s the very best CEO that Airbus has ever had,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory and a leading aerospace analyst, recently referring to the advantages gained by Boeing\u2019s main rival during his tenure running Boeing. His departure also comes in the face of widespread criticism of the company by CEOs of many of the world\u2019s major airlines Boeing depends upon to buy its planes. CEOs of numerous airlines had asked to speak directly to the Boeing board last week, which Calhoun tried to characterize Monday as a normal process, even if it\u2019s rare for customers to speak directly to directors. As to why Calhoun decided to stay on through the end of the year rather than leave immediately, he told CNBC: \u201cWe have another mountain to climb. Let\u2019s not avoid what happened with Alaska Air. Let\u2019s not avoid the call for action. Let\u2019s not avoid the changes that we need to make in our factories.\u201d \u201cWe will get through that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve committed myself to the board to do exactly that.\u201d Airlines\u2019 problems with Boeing The airlines are upset both by the quality of the planes they are getting from Boeing, and the fact that Boeing won\u2019t be able to deliver the planes they were counting on this year, as passenger demand continues to surge to record levels. Michael O\u2019Leary, CEO of Ryanair, Europe\u2019s largest airline and one that flies only Boeing 737 planes, told CNN last week that whenever it takes deliveries of Boeing jets \u201cwe spend 48 hours going through the plane checking it for errors, omissions or anything else.\u201d And O\u2019Leary said while it hasn\u2019t found anything major in those checks, it regularly finds minor problems such as tools under floorboards and missing seat handles, that \u201cshows, I think, a lack of attention to detail quality issues in Boeing.\u201d Ryanair issued a statement Monday saying, \u201cWe welcome these much-needed management changes in Seattle.\u201d United Airlines, which flies Boeing jets for more than 80% of its mainline fleet, has expressed disappointment in quality issues at Boeing and a delay in its scheduled deliveries. The airline is a primary customer for a stretched version of the Boeing 737 Max, known as the Max 10, but Boeing\u2019s inability to get the plane certified to carry passengers is also causing headaches. Scott Kirby, CEO of United, described the Alaska Airlines incident as the \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d for its plans to get the Max 10 this year, as planned, and it is now looking at possibly buying jets from Boeing rival Airbus to take the place of the Max 10s it has ordered. But it is difficult for airlines to shift to Airbus, which has a long backlog of jets it has already committed to build for its existing customer base. Any Boeing customer shifting to Airbus could find itself waiting until 2030 or beyond to get its planes delivered. And operating two types of aircraft of the same class is costly, since pilots are certified to fly specific aircraft, and most cannot shift back and forth between an Airbus and a Boeing without training. And the airline needs to keep a supply of expensive spare parts on hand for every type of aircraft it operates. Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci estimated recently it cost his airline $75 million to $100 million a year to operate both Airbus and Boeing single-aisle jets after it merged with Virgin America, which is why it got rid of its Airbus jets after the merger was complete. And Alaska is a smaller national airline, only America\u2019s fifth largest. Larger airlines face even greater costs from splitting fleets between manufacturers. Facing numerous safety probes The Boeing 737 Max 9 was grounded for three weeks after the Alaska Airlines incident as airlines completed inspections of their own planes\u2019 door plugs. Minicucci disclosed that many of his planes were discovered to have loose bolts, although he did not mention missing bolts. An audit of Boeing procedures by the Federal Aviation Administration in the wake of the Alaska Airlines incident found numerous \u201cnon-compliance issues.\u201d The agency gave the company 90 days to come up with a plan to fix its safety and quality issues. But the probes at Boeing aren\u2019t limited to the FAA audit. A preliminary investigation found that the plane left the Boeing factory in October without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place. While the NTSB has not identified who is at fault for the missing bolts, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy criticized Boeing for not providing the agency with the documentation for who handled the installation of the door plug. Calhoun told investors in January after the incident that \u201cwe caused the problem, and we understand that. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.\u201d And Boeing is also facing an investigation by the Justice Department, which could open it up to criminal liability, and upend a controversial deferred prosecution agreement the company reached in January 2021 to settle charges it defrauded the FAA during the original certification process for the 737 Max last decade. It was days away from having that probation-like period end when the Alaska Air incident happened. The company has also had problems not related to the Max during Calhoun\u2019s time in charge at Boeing, including a couple of halts in deliveries of the 787 Dreamliners, one of its main widebody jets, due to quality issues with that plane. Finance, not engineering background Calhoun, 66, a longtime board member at Boeing, became chairman of the company in late 2019, when the board stripped his predecessor Dennis Muilenburg of that title. He was tapped as CEO after Muilenburg was ousted in December of that year, starting in the job in January 2020. Boeing was once known as a company that put engineering excellence ahead of financial performance, and produced planes that were the gold standard in the industry. Critics of the company say that focus has changed in the last 25 years, citing the 1997 merger with competitor McDonell Douglas for the shift in focus on saving money. Calhoun is one of the executives since that time with no engineering background, having served as senior managing director and head of portfolio operations at investing firm The Blackstone Group, as well as CEO of Nielsen after 26 years at General Electric. Calhoun\u2019s tenure began about halfway through a 20-month grounding of the 737 Max due to a design flaw that was determined to have caused the two crashes; and just before the Covid pandemic broke out globally, causing a near halt in air travel and massive losses for the airlines Boeing depends upon to buy its planes. Asked about what he would like to see in his successor, Calhoun told CNBC Monday that \u201cI want somebody who knows how to handle a big, long, long-cycle business like ours. It\u2019s not just the production of the airplane. It\u2019s the development of the next airplane. It will be a $50 billion investment. I would like somebody who clearly has the experience inside our industry.\u201d Shares of Boeing, which have lost more than 26% of their value since the start of the year, were 4% higher at the market open Monday, but they soon lost most of that gain and closed slightly above 1%.

            "text": "The reports of harrowing and sometimes tragic incidents aboard airplanes accelerated this year, leading many to wonder if it\u2019s still safe to fly. A door plug blew out on an Alaska Airlines flight leaving a gaping hole in the Boeing 737 Max fuselage. Passengers\u2019 phones and clothing were ripped from their bodies and sent hurtling out into the night as oxygen masks dropped and the plane made its way to the ground, fortunately without any serious injuries. Another Boeing jet plunged so severely that passengers were thrown onto the ceiling of the cabin, leaving dozens so injured they need to be hospitalized upon landing. A passenger plane collided with a military plane at a Tokyo airport, killing five members of the Japanese Coast Guard who were responding to an earthquake. And more minor incidents happened, like when a 200-pound wheel fell off a plane on takeoff, crushing parked vehicles on the ground. Another plane\u2019s engine caught fire. A jet arrived at an airport only to have a missing panel discovered. These incidents all gained attention worthy of a Kardashian on social media. But answering the question of whether it is still safe to fly is not so straightforward. The quick answer is that flying is safe \u2014 safer than most forms of travel \u2014 and far, far safer than the car ride most people take every day without thinking twice. \u201cWhen you arrive at the airport, and step aboard the pressurized tube, that\u2019s the safest part of the trip,\u201d said Anthony Brickhouse, a crash investigator and professor of aviation safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. \u201cYou were more at risk driving to the airport.\u201d But it\u2019s also true that it\u2019s only pure luck that the American aviation industry has kept its near-perfect safety record intact. 15 nearly perfect years Since a regional jet crashed in Buffalo, New York, in January of 2009, killing 49 on board and one on the ground, only five other people have died in accidents on scheduled commercial flights in the United States: By comparison, an average of more than 100 people a day died on America\u2019s roads and highways between 2003 and 2022, the most recent year for which full year traffic deaths are available. That means nearly as many died on roads and highways every hour, on average, as the number of people who died in US commercial aviation crashes in 15 years. However, other forms of flying are not nearly as safe. Nearly 300 people have died since 2009 while traveling in \u201con demand\u201d air service, such as private jets. And nearly 5,500 people have died in general aviation, which are typically small planes often operated by amateur pilots. While commercial aviation has the safest record among transit options, railroads are the second safest form of travel. Railroads had 71 passenger deaths on commuter trains and Amtrak from 2009 through last year. But passenger trains logged far fewer miles traveled than planes or motor vehicles. When you control for the much higher number of miles traveled by planes, it\u2019s clearly much more dangerous to travel on the ground than to fly on a commercial US airline. Ed Pierson, the director of the Foundation for Aviation Safety and a harsh critic of Boeing, said he knows the stats, but because of concerns about quality controls at the embattled aircraft maker, he still would refuse to fly on the Boeing 737 Max or have a family member do so. He has even gotten off a Max just before departure after he was surprised to find out he was on that particular model of plane. Still, Pierson said he is willing to fly on most planes, even many older Boeing models. \u201cTaking the Max out of the equation, (flying has) been proven to be pretty darn safe,\u201d he said. Disaster narrowly averted Unfortunately, the safety record of recent years is not a guarantee of safety in the future. The record for the nearly fatality-free US airplane travel industry is partly due to the efforts of aviation authorities, airlines and aircraft manufacturers, despite the criticism heaped on all three of those groups recently. But mainly it\u2019s been sheer luck. In each case, if things had gone just a little differently, the outcomes could have been much worse. The Alaska Air plane that lost the door plug had flown for more than two months without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. It had made 153 flights before the door plug blew out at 16,000 feet. Twenty-two of those flights were between Hawaii and the mainland. If the door had blown out at the normal 35,000-foot cruising altitude, or hours from the nearest airport over the open Pacific Ocean, or if the plug had gone straight back and hit the tail of the plane and caused damage, it could likely have caused a loss of the aircraft and the 177 people on board. And that\u2019s not the biggest break. A year ago, the discussion about air safety wasn\u2019t focused on Boeing planes. It was on a series of near-misses on runways at the nation\u2019s airports with reports of incident after incident of narrowly averted collisions. Near disasters for planes on the ground On February 4, 2023, a FedEx jet came within 150 feet of the runway before its pilots realized a Southwest jet was in the process of taking off on the same runway. It was one of five such incidents in which an accident was only narrowly avoided in a period of just seven weeks at the start of last year. And none of those were as potentially serious as another incident in July 2017, when an Air Canada jet piloted by a captain who had been awake for more than 19 hours nearly landed on a taxiway at San Francisco International Airport where three wide-body jets filled with passengers were waiting to take off. The NTSB later determined the Air Canada jet got within 100 feet of the ground before it took off again without making contact with any of the passenger planes on the ground. The safety regulator said more than 1,000 people on the four planes might have died had the accident not been averted at the last moment. \u201cIt would have been the worst disaster in aviation history,\u201d Brickhouse said. \u201cPilots, air traffic controllers, mechanics \u2014 they\u2019re all human, and humans make mistakes. We\u2019ve been working toward designing the system so that when mistakes are made, we can recover from them without it being a tragedy.\u201d But Pierson said the system is under unprecedented stress, and regulators, airlines and aircraft manufactures like Boeing need to make changes. \u201cI think the system is under tremendous stress,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a shortage of staff, in air traffic control, a shortage of pilots, of maintenance personnel, of manufacturing personnel.\u201d Plagued by overconfidence? What concerns Pierson the most is the attitude that the apparent safety of the American aviation system means nothing needs to be improved. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of overconfidence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gold standard is melting down, because we continue to try to downplay everything and talk about how safe the system is. That\u2019s not the right mindset. That\u2019s the mindset that gets people killed.\u201d Brickhouse believes the planes now in use are safe. He said the drama of the Alaska Air incident brought attention to a series of other events that in and of themselves don\u2019t pose a serious threat, even if they should not have happened. \u201cWe have safety events in aviation all the time. That is not an indictment of the aviation industry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after Alaska Air, it became a snowballing event and everyone became hypersensitive.\u201d Despite having more confidence in the safety of the system than Pierson, Brickhouse said he also wouldn\u2019t dismiss anyone who\u2019s fearful about flying right now or who wants to avoid a plane like the 737 Max. And he has his own concerns about things like the number of narrowly avoided accidents at the nation\u2019s airports. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in luck, but we are fortunate that these incidents  did not turn into disasters,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have a trend that keeps occurring, you need to focus on fixing it.\u201d",

            "text": "The situation at Boeing is grim. Serious program execution problems and high-profile safety incidents, with still-fresh memories of the two\u00a0737\u00a0MAX disasters\u00a0in\u00a02018 and 2019, are damaging the company\u2019s brand and bringing increased regulatory scrutiny. Its recovery won\u2019t begin until management starts examining how the company got here. Years ago, an excessive focus on financial returns led Boeing to badly neglect two of its greatest resources: its people and its suppliers. First, in the 2010s, Boeing made a forceful effort to weaken its workforce\u2019s power. Aggressive moves, such as transferring production sites to\u00a0new locations\u00a0and\u00a0threatening to move additional work, reduced labor\u2019s negotiating power, resulting in\u00a0minimal pay increases\u00a0and\u00a0terminated pension plans. Most damaging, then-CEO\u00a0Jim McNerney\u00a0systematically promoted non-technical people to executive positions, particularly on the\u00a0board. Incredibly, the\u00a0MAX\u00a0was developed under him and the commercial unit CEO \u2014 neither of whom had a technical degree. Current CEO Dave Calhoun, also\u00a0not an engineer, has followed the same path,\u00a0promoting\u00a0people with similar finance backgrounds. At the same time, the company went after its suppliers\u2019 profits. Programs like\u00a0Partnering For Success called for consistent price reductions, even as demand increased. Boeing pursued its suppliers\u2019\u00a0product support business,\u00a0further impacting their business models.\u00a0Payment terms were increased to 120 days\u00a0in many cases, up from around\u00a030 days. The company announced a\u00a0\u201cno-fly list,\u201d\u00a0implying that suppliers that didn\u2019t give in to Boeing\u2019s demands would not be used for future jets. Boeing even began an ill-advised program of\u00a0vertical integration, aiming to replicate systems and components provided by some of its specialized suppliers, to further pressure them on price. Effectively, workers and suppliers were being crunched to provide rewards to Boeing shareholders. And in the short run, it worked great. In 2012, 19% of operating cash flow was being returned to\u00a0shareholders\u00a0in the form of dividends and buybacks. By 2015, this had ramped up to an astonishing 99%. It stayed in the 90% range until the two MAX crashes and the resulting MAX line shutdown. Between 2014 and 2018, the company rewarded investors with $53 billion in these returns.\u00a0Senior executives, often compensated on the basis of\u00a0stock returns, also did quite well. The result of this strategy is plain to see: an under-resourced supply chain, and an equally under-resourced and badly alienated workforce. These have resulted in\u00a0missed production targets, serious\u00a0program delays,\u00a0failed safety audits and embarrassing instances of\u00a0shoddy workmanship. Regulatory and political scrutiny is increasing and will likely worsen. Boeing\u2019s brand is increasingly tarnished. Airlines are increasingly\u00a0vocal with their anger and frustration, as their fleet plans \u2014 and associated revenue forecasts \u2014 have been confounded by delivery delays. Technical issues, coupled with increased regulatory oversight, have jeopardized certification timing for two new variants of the 737 MAX, the\u00a0737 MAX 7\u00a0and 737\u00a0MAX 10. Airlines like\u00a0Southwest\u00a0and United\u00a0had pegged their fleet plans to these models,\u00a0so the\u00a0delays\u00a0are sure to impact the number of flights they\u2019re able to schedule. And even Boeing\u2019s\u00a0stock price\u00a0has begun to suffer \u2014 ironic for a management team accused of an excessive financial focus. All is not lost. Boeing still has good people, impressive technologies and great jetliners. The latter are\u00a0in a duopoly with very high entry barriers, even if Airbus is quickly gaining market share. All that\u2019s needed is a new approach to management at the top. If there is a new management team, it would be wise for them to learn from history. Treating suppliers and workers as partners would be a great start. Senior executives need to engage directly with them, spending time in factories, talking with the suppliers, engineers and machinists engaged in the company\u2019s core business. Instead of denying the need for any new products \u2014 as\u00a0Calhoun bizarrely did in November 2022\u00a0when he said the company might not introduce any new models until the 2030s\u00a0\u2014 they should be talking about new opportunities that would restore the company to industry leadership. A lot of this comes down to just showing up. The current approach of staying in office buildings and focusing on financial abstractions clearly isn\u2019t working.",

            "text": "Passengers on board the Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 that suffered a terrifying midair blowout in January have received a letter from the FBI saying they may be victims \u201cof a crime.\u201d Attorney Mark Lindquist, who represents multiple passengers that were on Alaska Airlines flight 1282, shared with CNN the letter that the FBI office in Seattle sent to passengers on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m contacting you because we have identified you as a possible victim of a crime,\u201d the letter reads in part. It also notes that the FBI is currently investigating the case. \u201cMy clients and I welcome the DOJ investigation,\u201d Lindquist told CNN, \u201cWe want accountability. We want answers. We want safer Boeing planes. And a DOJ investigation helps advance our goals.\u201d Attorney Robert Clifford, who represents many family members of the 2019 crash victims of a Boeing 737 Max jet flown by Ethiopian Air as well as some of the recent Alaska Air passengers, said some of his clients on Alaska Air also got the letter notifying them that they could be crime victims. \u201cI\u2019m certain everyone on the plane will be getting this letter,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe families of the Ethiopian Air victims should have also been considered crime victims.\u201d In addition to the letters that went out to passengers, flight attendants aboard Alaska Air Flight 1282 have been interviewed by investigators from the Justice Department, according to people familiar with the situation. The letters were first reported by the Wall Street Journal earlier this month. \u201cThe FBI does not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation,\u201d FBI Seattle\u2019s Public Affairs Office wrote in an email to CNN, citing Department of Justice policy. Boeing\u2019s potential criminal liability But Justice opened a probe into the incident and Boeing in February,\u00a0CNN has previously reported. That investigation carries the potential to upend a controversial deferred prosecution agreement that Boeing reached with the Justice Department in the final month of the Trump administration. Tha settlement, which was criticized by families of crash victims and members of Congress, was over charges that Boeing defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the original certification process for the 737 Max jets. Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion as part of that settlement, but most of that was money Boeing had already agreed to pay to the airlines that had purchased the Max jets grounded for 20 months following the Ethiopian Air crash and an earlier crash in Indonesia. The deferred prosecution agreement could have ended the threat of Boeing facing criminal liability for those earlier fraud charges. But the Alaska Air incident came just days before a three-year probation-like period was due to end, so the criminal probe could expose Boeing to charges not just for the Alaska Air incident but also the earlier allegations of criminal wrongdoing. Boeing declined to comment. On January 5, 171 passengers and six crew members boarded the flight in Portland, Oregon, bound for Ontario, California. Abruptly after take off, a panel of the fuselage called the \u201cdoor plug\u201d blew off, forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing. A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the jet, which was delivered to Alaska by Boeing in October, had left Boeing\u2019s factory without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place. While the NTSB has yet to assess blame for the missing bolts, it has criticized Boeing for not having the documentation available showing who worked on the door plug when the plane was at Boeing\u2019s factory. The FAA has also found multiple problems with production practices of both Boeing and its major supplier Spirit AeroSystems following a six-week audit of Boeing triggered by the January 5 door plug blowout. Subpoenas from the Justice Department were also recently sent seeking documents and information that may be related to Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems and mentions the \u201cdoor plug\u201d that is used in the Boeing 737 Max 9s, according to a\u00a0report from Bloomberg. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told investors last month that \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.\u201d The development comes the same week Boeing said it will report massive losses in the first quarter stemming from the Alaska Airlines incident. The losses will be in part because of compensation to airlines that owned the Max 9, which was\u00a0grounded for three weeks\u00a0after the incident. Alaska Air CEO Ben Minicucci told investors last month that the incident cost his\u00a0airline about $150 million, and that it expected to be compensated for those losses by Boeing. The other contributors to losses will be \u201call the things we\u2019re doing around the factory,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brian West said on Wednesday, leading to slower production at its 737 Max plant in Renton Washington.",

            "text": "Boeing\u2019s production problems are reverberating through an airline industry starved for planes, making it harder for carriers to meet red-hot demand for travel and raising the prospect of even higher ticket prices. On Wednesday, Ryanair (RYAAY) CEO Michael O\u2019Leary explained why prices have further to climb. \u201cIf you have constrained supply (and) strong demand, I think it\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019re going to see air fares bump again this summer\u2026 between 5 and 10%,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Richard Quest. Europe\u2019s biggest airline by passengers had expected to receive 57 Boeing planes this summer, but now anticipates getting between 35 and 40, according to O\u2019Leary. Ryanair is far from the only major carrier with too few aircraft. Southwest in the United States, which flies only Boeing 737 planes, announced last week that Boeing would deliver 40% fewer jets than it had been expecting this year. A critical shortage of planes is also plaguing other airlines \u2014 and the problem is not confined to Boeing. According to aviation analytics firm Cirium, about 600 Airbus jets globally have been grounded for at least the last month due to an issue with engines made by US aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney. That\u2019s hurting Lufthansa, the German group that also owns carriers in Austria and Switzerland. CEO Carsten Spohr told CNN Wednesday that it has more than 30 Airbus A320Neos currently grounded. \u201cThis industry \u2026 suffers from this lack of airplanes,\u201d he added, noting that the shortage was affecting the company\u2019s ability to grow. The grounding of some planes and delayed deliveries of new aircraft will mean that fares in the United States \u201cshould stay elevated through 2024, instead of tapering\u2026 as occurred last year after May,\u201d according to Robert Mann, founder of\u00a0R.W. Mann & Company, an airline industry consulting firm in the United States. Mann cited data from Airlines Reporting Corporation, which tracks ticket sales worldwide, showing that fares on US domestic flights booked in February for travel this year were 5%-6% higher than the same month last year, far outpacing overall inflation. Airbus output still below 2019 The supply constraints helping to keep air fares higher may be around for some time yet. There\u2019s a near-duopoly between Boeing and Airbus in commercial aircraft manufacturing, meaning airlines have almost no option but to wait in line. According to ADS, the United Kingdom\u2019s aerospace industry association, the global order backlog for commercial aircraft has now topped 15,700. Last year, airlines globally placed 3,850 commercial aircraft orders, the highest number since ADS started publishing the data in 2010 and a 91% increase on 2022. By comparison, planemakers delivered 1,265 aircraft, just 11% up on the previous year. Boeing said this week that it had slowed production of its 737 Max jets after a part of the fuselage of a Max 9 blew out mid-flight in early January, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Aviation regulators have yet to certify Boeing\u2019s Max 10 as safe for passengers \u2014 a plane crucial to the growth of carriers such as Ryanair, which inked a $40 billion deal last year to buy up to 300 of the aircraft. United Airlines, for its part, is not waiting around for Max 10s. The US carrier has asked Boeing to stop building it Max 10s and build Max 9s instead, and is also looking at plugging the gaps with Airbus planes, provided it makes financial sense. \u201cIf we get a deal that the economics work, we\u2019ll do something (with Airbus),\u201d CEO Scott Kirby said at a JPMorgan conference last week. But \u2014 as Kirby well knows \u2014 it\u2019s not that easy to switch planemakers. Aircraft orders are placed years in advance and pilots are trained to fly certain planes. Airbus, meanwhile, had an order backlog approaching 8,600 commercial aircraft at the end of last year and is already booked up until 2030. The European planemaker is also a lot less productive than it used to be as pandemic supply chain kinks linger. \u201cAt Airbus, we are still producing far less planes than we were producing in 2019,\u201d CEO Guillame Faury said at the \u201cEurope 2024\u201d conference in Berlin this week. According to Johan Lundgren, the CEO of EasyJet, the low-cost UK carrier is \u201cprobably the only airline in Europe\u201d getting all its aircraft orders from Airbus on time this year. The industry will likely be constrained for the next three years, he told CNN. Soaring demand Even before Boeing\u2019s troubles turned the industry on its head, airlines were ill-prepared for the spectacular comeback in air travel that followed the pandemic. Many had slashed the size of their fleets and laid off thousands of employees just to stay afloat as Covid-19 lockdowns throttled air travel. Airlines are now scrambling to respond to resurgent demand, as Boeing\u2019s crisis collides with supply chain problems. A global boom in defense spending is complicating matters further, since about 40% of the supply chain serves both aerospace and defense companies, according to Craven at ADS. The question now, says Richard Aboulafia, a longtime aviation consultant, is how quickly Airbus can ramp up and go from \u201chalf the market to two-thirds and beyond.\u201d \u201cThis is an industry with only two suppliers, very high barriers to entry and (an) extremely strong comeback with a very tight labor market,\u201d he told CNN. Some 4.7 billion people are expected to travel by plane this year, an historic high that exceeds the 4.5 billion recorded in 2019, according to the International Air Transport Association, an industry group. \u201cCapacity is going to be tight and that leads to higher ticket prices,\u201d said Aboulafia, who is managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \u201cWhat you\u2019ll probably see is (that) the reduction in high fares we were hoping to see doesn\u2019t happen. You\u2019ll probably see a reversal\u2026 across the board and centered in the Atlantic.\u201d Richard Quest and Maisie Linford contributed reporting. ",

            "text": "Two years after a Boeing 737-800 passenger jet nosedived 29,000 feet into a remote mountain, killing all 132 people on board, investigators in China have failed to offer new insight into the cause of the country\u2019s deadliest air disaster in decades. In an update of its probe released Wednesday ahead of the crash anniversary, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) did not address the crucial question of what had prompted\u00a0China Eastern flight 5735\u00a0to nosedive, nor did it mention data from the plane\u2019s black boxes that would offer key clues to explain what happened. Instead, its statement merely reiterated earlier findings that it found no problems with\u00a0the aircraft,\u00a0crew or weather conditions before the flight departed the southwestern city of Kunming for Guangzhou on March 21, 2022. The update failed to quell speculation in China about what caused the fatal crash, with some asking why investigators had not disclosed information from the black boxes. Black boxes\u00a0record all relevant\u00a0flight\u00a0data, as well as conversations in the cockpit, which are used by investigators to reconstruct the events leading to an aircraft incident. In a summary of its preliminary report released in April 2022, the CAAC said the two black boxes of the crashed China Eastern jet were \u201cseverely damaged\u201d and \u201cthe data restoration and analysis work is still in progress.\u201d But sophisticated laboratories like those run by the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and its counterparts in France, Australia and the United Kingdom, can reconstruct even broken memory cards and then line up the data with audio feeds into the cockpit voice recorder. The Wall Street Journal reported in May 2022 that black box data recovered from the flight\u00a0and sent to the US NTSB for analysis suggests someone in the cockpit intentionally downed the plane, citing a preliminary assessment from United States officials. \u201cThe plane did what it was told to do by someone in the cockpit,\u201d the Journal quoted a person who is familiar with American officials\u2019 preliminary assessment as saying. The CAAC has previously denied the crash was caused intentionally. \u201cThese rumors\u2026have seriously misled the public and interfered with the investigation of the accident,\u201d Wu Shijie, a CAAC official, told a news conference in April 2022. In its update Wednesday, the CAAC said no faults or abnormalities were found in the aircraft\u2019s systems, structures or engines before take-off. The flight and cabin crew held valid licenses, and the crew had enough rest and passed health checks on the day of the flight;\u00a0the support staff and facilities at the departure airport were fine, so were air control personnel and communication, navigation and monitoring systems, it said. Before the crash, there were no abnormalities in radio communications and control commands, or any reports of dangerous weather in the airspace of the plane or along its route, according to the CAAC. There was also no evidence to suggest the plane was carrying dangerous items in cargo or passengers\u2019 luggage, it added. \u201cIn the follow-up, the technical investigation team will continue to carry out experimental verification and cause analysis, and release relevant information in a timely manner based on the progress of the investigation,\u201d the statement said, suggesting the investigation will continue into a third year. The statement was met with strong criticism on Chinese social media. \u201cIf everything is normal, it means that it is either done intentionally by someone on board, or caused by sudden force majeure!\u201d said a top comment on social platform Weibo with nearly 28,000 upvotes.

            "text": "Boeing will report a massive loss in the first quarter stemming from the Alaska Airlines door plug blowout on January 5, Chief Financial Officer Brian West said at an investor conference Wednesday. The beleaguered company said its commercial airplane unit\u2019s operating profit margin would plunge to around -20%. That would be the biggest loss margin at the Boeing unit in two years, since the company had been forced to halt deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner because of other quality issues at that time. This time, the 737 Max production has been slowed because of the door plug that blew off of a 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Air flight soon after takeoff, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet. Shares of Boeing, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, were down about 2% in premarket trading on the guidance. The losses will be in part because of compensation to airlines that owned the Max 9, which was grounded for three weeks after the incident. Alaska Air CEO Ben Minicucci told investors last month that the incident cost his airline about $150 million, and that it expected to be compensated for those losses by Boeing. The other contributors to losses will be \u201call the things we\u2019re doing around the factory,\u201d West said, leading to slower production at its 737 Max plant in Renton Washington. \u201cThere are changes that need to happen. There\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe\u2019re deliberately going slow to get this right. For years, we prioritized the movement of the airplane through the factory over getting it done right, and that\u2019s got to change.\u201d West said that Boeing would slow production of the Max below the 38 per month it was building at the end of 2023. It had originally planned to increase production this year, but those plans to increase output were halted by the Federal Aviation Administration as it conducts an audit of Boeing\u2019s operations. It has given Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to fix quality and safety issues for its commercial planes. West described the audit, which has found wide ranging problems with quality controls at Boeing factories, as \u201ca tougher audit than anything we\u2019ve been through before.\u201d He said profit margins in the commercial airplane unit, the largest at Boeing, would be negative through the rest of this year, although they will \u201cget better through the year.\u201d \u201cBut if we run the business for the long term, we believe that those margins are going to get to historical levels in the \u201925-\u201826 timeframe.\u201d The company\u2019s commercial plane unit had a 14% operating profit margin for 2018, its most recent profitable year. Higher production rates in the future will allow that return to profitability, according to West, along with the shutdown of what Boeing calls \u201cshadow factories\u201d where planes that come off the assembly line are held back from being delivered to customers for additional work that needs to be done on them. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that needs to happen between now and then,\u201d he said. The company reported a $41 million operating profit for its commercial aircraft unit in the fourth quarter, giving it a 0.4% profit margin, the first positive margin at the unit in nearly five years. It faced a 20-month grounding of the 737 Max that started in 2019 following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people that was attributed to a design flaw with the planes. Since the start of that grounding, Boeing has reported total operating losses of $31.5 billion through the end of last year. While a 20% loss margin is bad, Boeing has seen worse recently, with the loss margin from its commercial airplane unit soaring to 169% in the second quarter of 2020, as it dealt with both the Max grounding and the start of the pandemic. The pandemic caused airlines globally to essentially stop taking deliveries of new jets due to massive losses caused by a near halt in air travel.",

            "text": "The soft landing that once looked nearly impossible for the Federal Reserve to pull off is still on track. That\u2019s the message from Jan Hatzius, the chief economist of Goldman Sachs. \u201cCertainly, it doesn\u2019t look like the economy is anywhere close to a recession,\u201d Hatzius told CNN. Even though he concedes inflation has come in hotter-than-expected so far this year, the Goldman economist is sticking by his prescient call for a soft landing. \u201cIf I look at the news flow overall over the last year, it\u2019s still very, very positive,\u201d Hatzius said. \u201cInflation has come down very substantially over that period. And more importantly, it\u2019s come down without significant weakness in activity. We haven\u2019t seen a recession. We haven\u2019t been close to a recession.\u201d To fight inflation, the Federal Reserve spiked interest rates in 2022 and 2023 at the fastest pace since the 1980s under legendary Fed chief Paul Volcker. Many feared that war on inflation would cause unemployment to surge and short-circuit the economic recovery from Covid-19. At one point in the fall of 2022, a model by Bloomberg projected a 100% risk of a US recession over the following 12 months. Now, many economists are in the soft landing camp as consumer spending and the jobs market have proven to be much more resilient than anticipated. Hatzius told CNN he\u2019s \u201cpretty confident\u201d there won\u2019t be a US recession over the next 12 months, placing just a 15% risk of a downturn. That\u2019s more or less the average recession risk on any given year. That upbeat forecast should be a relief to those in the White House trying to sell voters on President Joe Biden\u2019s economic message. A recession could doom that effort. Since 1900, all five president running for reelection who had a recession in the year they ran for reelection lost, according to TD Cowen Washington Research Group. (Those five presidents were William Howard Taft, Herbert Hoover, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and Donald Trump.) What could accelerate rate cuts Hatzius told CNN that inflation will likely have cooled enough by June to pave the way for the Fed to start cutting interest rates. That would help ease high borrowing costs on everything from mortgages and car loans to credit cards. \u201cOur forecast and current market expectation is that the first cut comes in June, but it\u2019s going to be data dependent,\u201d Hatzius said. The Fed could speed up interest rate cuts if the historically-strong jobs market starts to weaken. \u201cIf we were to see more pervasive signs of labor market deterioration, I\u2019d say it becomes more urgent to move,\u201d Hatzius said. Even as hiring has remained sturdy, the unemployment rate climbed to 3.9% in February, up from the historic low of 3.5% as recently as July 2023. Hatzius said that if the unemployment rate moves into the low-4% range, that would make officials inside the Fed nervous enough to start pulling forward their rate cut plans. Unknown unknowns Even though recession risks have eased, there are always wildcards that could change the picture quickly. \u201cAlmost by definition, I think shocks are negative. Now what am I worried about? Geopolitics would certainly be high up on the list,\u201d Hatzius said. \u201cWe live in a much more unstable world with military conflict, the war in Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, more tensions between the US and China.\u201d And then there are the unknown unknowns, as Donald Rumsfeld famously phrased. \u201cThe shock that occurred four years ago was kind of the most extreme version of an unknown, unknown that we have seen in many decades, if not ever,\u201d Hatzius said, referring to Covid. Empty office buildings One risk that is casting a shadow over the economy is empty office buildings in the $20 trillion commercial real estate market \u2014 a problem caused in part by Covid and the rise of remote work. Yet Hatzius, like Fed Chair Jerome Powell, doesn\u2019t think empty office buildings will sink the US economy the way toxic mortgages did in 2008. He pointed to the fact that office construction is a relatively small part of the economy and the fact that this problem is expected to play out over several years. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how that would cause a recession,\u201d Hatzius said.",

The Novo Nordisk Foundation has awarded France\u2019s Eviden a contract to build what the computing company says will be one of the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputers, able to process vast amounts of data using AI. It should provide \u201cunprecedented potential to accelerate groundbreaking scientific discoveries in areas such as drug discovery, disease diagnosis and treatment,\u201d\u00a0C\u00e9dric Bourrasset, Eviden\u2019s head of quantum computing, said in a statement.

Named Gefion, the supercomputer will be available for use by researchers from Denmark\u2019s public and private sectors, and will enjoy the backing of two of the hottest companies in the United States and Europe. Nvidia is now one of the largest companies on the US stock market, valued at $2.21 trillion. The new supercomputer will use Nvidia\u2019s latest chip technology. The foundation, meanwhile, has a controlling stake in Novo Nordisk (NVO), a company worth more than Tesla.

            "text": "There\u2019s a global energy crisis and onshore wind farms are a potential growth option. Larger wind turbines produce more power than standard ones, but the components are too big to be transported by road. What\u2019s the solution? A Colorado-based energy startup named Radia has an idea. It\u2019s developing the biggest aircraft in aviation history. Meet the WindRunner airplane, whose mission will be to deliver gigantic 300-foot-long blades directly to wind farms. To help the world meet its decarbonization targets, it\u2019ll use sustainable aviation fuel and needs only a simple packed-dirt or gravel runway to land on. It\u2019ll operate from regional hubs, says Radia, delivering where needed \u2013 and \u201ccan land on airstrips as short as 6,000 feet (1,800 meters), something no other large commercial aircraft can achieve.\u201d Let\u2019s talk about specs, baby When it comes to carrying the largest payloads ever moved by air, dainty just isn\u2019t going to cut it. So WindRunner will have a cargo bay volume of 272,000 cubic feet, enough to hold three Olympic swimming pools. That\u2019s 12 times the volume of a Boeing 747-400 and \u2013 at 356 feet in length, it\u2019s 127 feet longer too. As for the wingspan, that\u2019s 261 feet \u2013 imagine four bowling lanes laid end to end. It will also dwarf the Antonov An-225, the heaviest aircraft ever built, which was destroyed at the start of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The aircraft\u2019s scale might be groundbreaking, but the engineering is not \u2013 and that\u2019s by design. Radia says it\u2019s focusing \u201con existing technology and safety by using, where applicable, tried-and-true aviation materials, components and fabrication techniques that have FAA [US Federal Aviation Administration] approval, are already in mass production and are lowest-risk.\u201d The idea is to hit the ground running with a fast, well-built fleet that meets aerospace industry standards. Online reports say commercial operations as soon as 2027, but there\u2019s no timeline confirmed on Radia\u2019s website. CNN has reached out to the company for comment. There she blows Radia is banking on research organisation Bloomberg NEF\u2019s estimation that up to $10 trillion will be spent on onshore wind through 2050. The development of WindRunner is to enable GigaWind, the XXL turbines made by Radia\u2019s partners, which include five of the world\u2019s top six turbine manufacturers. Currently, turbine blades today are ordinarily 230 feet or less (70 meters), but Radia wants to deploy blades of up to 104 meters (341 feet). The company says GigaWind turbines could potentially be two to three times more powerful \u2013 and two to three times more profitable than those typically deployed today. So who are the folks behind these ambitious claims? The founder and CEO is Mark Lundstrum, a cross-industry entrepreneur and MIT aerospace engineer who founded Radia in 2016. The company says its team of advisers include former top brass from Boeing, MIT, Rolls-Royce and the FAA, as well as former US Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz and former Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull. It\u2019s an impressive lineup and the decision to focus on safe, existing technology is a smart one. Might we see a WindRunner take off before the end of the decade? Could its distinctive shape one day be as popular as the Beluga XL transporter planes created by Airbus? Watch the skies.",

            "text": "Five years before Concorde\u2019s first flight, another majestic supersonic aircraft took to the skies \u2014 and almost became the inspiration for an even faster passenger plane. It was the XB-70 Valkyrie, an experimental plane developed for the US Air Force. Its inaugural flight \u2014 60 years ago in September 1964 \u2014 kicked off a golden era for supersonic aircraft. The plane would later achieve a speed of just over 2,000 miles per hour, nearly 50% faster than Concorde. \u201cThe overall design of the XB-70 was a thing of beauty,\u201d says Tony Landis, a historian at the Air Force Materiel Command in Dayton, Ohio. \u201cTo think such an attractive aircraft, with its speed and altitude capabilities, was built over 65 years ago is hard to comprehend in today\u2019s AI and computer-based engineering environment.\u201d The XB-70 program was not without problems: As a military plane, it was obsolete before it was even rolled out, and its short lifespan was marred by a tragic accident. Even regular flights had everyone on edge, as the aircraft\u2019s components were all pushed to the limits. However, its design has made it an icon of supersonic flight: \u201cTo this day, people stop and stare at the Valkyrie parked majestically at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, admiring its size and shape,\u201d Landis says. \u201cMost people ask if this is a new design, as they\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d Dead on arrival The plane was born out of a competition between Boeing and North American Aviation, then a major aerospace manufacturer that was eventually chosen by the Air Force, in 1957, to develop a bomber capable of carrying nuclear weapons at Mach 2 and 60,000 feet of altitude. However, the downing of an American U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union in 1960 caused a shift from manned bombers to ballistic missiles, and in 1961 President Kennedy billed the upcoming XB-70 as having little chance of penetrating enemy defenses successfully. As a result, just as North American was starting to build the aircraft, the goal of the program shifted to high-speed flight research. The first XB-70 \u2014 nicknamed Valkyrie following a naming contest \u2014 was rolled out in Palmdale, California, on May 11, 1964. With a wingspan of over 100 feet, six General Electric turbojet engines at the back, and 185 feet long, it was easily one of the most impressive planes ever built. Among its distinctive features were wingtips that remained horizontal at subsonic speeds, but folded down once supersonic to reduce drag. Its main design elements, like the delta-shaped wings and the thin, long fuselage were replicated by both Concorde and its Soviet clone, the Tupolev Tu-144, which even sported two \u201ccanards\u201d or winglets right behind the cockpit \u2014 just like the XB-70 \u2014 giving pilots more control at low speeds. \u201cThroughout the 1960s, both the military and civil sector put vast amounts of resources into developing a supersonic transport,\u201d says Landis. \u201cIn the early stages, nearly every aircraft company based its initial design around the XB-70.\u201d As more information became available, Landis adds, these designs morphed into more refined designs like Concorde, as well as other projects that remained on paper, such as the planned Concorde rivals imagined by Lockheed and Boeing. Fake windows Once it was clear that the Valkyrie\u2019s role as a bomber was set aside, its designers came up with alternative uses for the plane: \u201cNorth American engineers became very creative, with many different uses for the aircraft,\u201d says Landis, \u201cBut the only variant to be given serious consideration was the transport version for military and civilian use.\u201d Three variations were proposed, ranging from a high-density one with capacity for 158 passengers, to a \u201cdeluxe\u201d arrangement that allowed for 114 seats and included a lounge area in the center of the passenger compartment. \u201cWhile the first XB-70 was back at Palmdale for inspections and upgrades, North American took the opportunity to add fake window markings to one side of the aircraft to assist in the marketing of the transport variant. The windows were removed prior to the aircraft\u2019s return to flight testing,\u201d Landis says. It\u2019s hard to imagine what the passenger experience could have been like on such a plane, but according to Landis it would have been a lot like Concorde: \u201cSmooth, quiet, with ample space between the seats. Due to the expense in operating the aircraft and limited seating, the cost would most likely be affordable only to the upper middle class and the wealthy.\u201d Most importantly, it would have been fast, connecting London and New York in just two and a half hours, compared to Concorde\u2019s typical three and a half. Other proposed versions of the plane imagined it as a launch platform for orbital spacecraft and even Minuteman missiles \u2013 but just like the passenger version, these never materialized. A fatal crash The XB-70 program was further cut short by a fatal accident that occurred in 1966, during a photoshoot organized by General Electric. The second, and more advanced, of the two existing Valkyries collided in midair with a smaller plane, an F-104N, killing its pilot as well as one of the XB-70\u2019s own pilots, with the other surviving with serious injuries. The destroyed Valkyrie had logged just 46 flights, and the remaining one ended its career after 83 flights \u2014 many of which with NASA as a supersonic testbed \u2014 and just over 160 hours in the air. The very last of those flights occurred on February 4, 1969, to ferry the plane from what is now NASA\u2019s Armstrong Flight Research Center in California to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, where the aircraft joined the collection of the Air Force Museum. While the program may not have lived up to its full potential, the XB-70\u2019s legacy still stands, Landis says: \u201cAll large, high-speed aircraft designs benefit from the work done by the XB-70. And the data from those research flights continues to affect the design of future aircraft.\u201d",

            "text": "Running to the tail of Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner is an umbilical cord carrying a rapid play-by-play of virtually every flight feature. The data, which totals more than a thousand parameters, is swiftly saved electronically into the flight data recorder (FDR), one of the so-called black boxes that aviation safety investigators say offers critical facts when piecing together an incident, like the mid-air plunge on LATAM Airlines flight 800 earlier this week that injured 50 people. The FDR and cockpit voice recorder from the LATAM flight should provide evidence to prove or refute the pilot\u2019s initial explanation, as relayed by a passenger who spoke to CNN: that cockpit displays briefly went blank and the pilot lost control of the plane.\u00a0It could also show whether the yoke was pushed forward, sending the plane rapidly downward \u2014 a scenario The Wall Street Journal reported the investigators are probing, and which may have involved a flight attendant hitting a switch while serving pilots a meal. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no way this will be a mystery,\u201d said Peter Goelz, who led investigations as managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board, and is now a CNN aviation analyst. \u201cThe recorder will indicate if something was starting and what happened.\u201d Regardless of what the FDR shows, the contents of the orange steel box with reflective tape typically mounted in the rear of the plane, which is meant to reduce the risk of damage in a crash, have proven pivotal in past airplane investigations. Used in past investigations In 2015, investigators used the FDR to conclude that a pilot of Germanwings flight 9525 deliberately slammed the airliner into a mountain and ruled out potential airplane malfunctions.\u00a0The FDR recorded 600 parameters onto a modern memory card and investigators extracted the data despite its exposure to extreme temperatures in the crash. Sophisticated laboratories like those run by the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and its counterparts in France, Australia and the United Kingdom, can reconstruct even broken memory cards and then line up the data with audio feeds into the cockpit voice recorder.\u00a0The bright orange color of the container that houses the recorder, a well as locator beacons, help searchers locate the recorders. The devices found underwater are typically transported to the lab inside water before being carefully dried, Goelz said. The 787 Dreamliner \u2014 one of Boeing\u2019s more recently developed aircraft \u2014 feeds data into the flight data recorder through a system called the Common Data Network, which some compare to the human body\u2019s central nervous system.\u00a0It first flew in 2009 and uses new-at-the-time data transfer technologies. US regulations specify about 90 parameters that must be fed into the black box.\u00a0The list includes the thrust for each engine, temperature, flap settings, and the plane\u2019s direction.\u00a0International Civil Aviation Organization standards further specify how often and detailed the data must be.\u00a0Altitude, for example, is recorded four times per second and accurate to the half-degree. The data now encompasses \u201cevery parameter you can imagine \u2014 like notes on a musical score,\u201d said Kathleen Bangs, a spokeswoman for the aviation tracking site FlightAware, and a former pilot.\u00a0\u201cWhen they take all that data and lay it all together, and put this musical score together, that\u2019s when you get really get the full picture.\u201d But the black boxes are not the only tools investigators will have.\u00a0Many components of modern planes, such as the engines, also contain computer chips that track detailed data. Other evidence tools Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is equipment on aircraft that transmits real-time data including the airplane\u2019s position.\u00a0The Federal Aviation Administration used this data after ungrounding Boeing\u2019s 737 Max in late 2020 to track every Max flight. Data is also sent to airlines using the Aircraft Communications, Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), which transmits automated and manually entered messages between airlines and airplanes using radio waves and satellite links. Some aircraft also carry a Quick Access Recorder (QAR) that is not hardened like the FDR but tracks the same data. The QAR can be easily hooked up to a laptop and allow airline employees to download plane performance information for analysis. But it wasn\u2019t always this way. When United Airlines flight 585 crashed shortly before landing in March 1991, the FDR held five data points:\u00a0direction, speed, altitude, G-force, and whether the radio microphone was keyed to transmit. When US Air flight 427 crashed three years later near Pittsburgh, the FDR recorded 11 parameters. \u201cIf these airplanes had been equipped with FDRs with additional parameters, that information would have undoubtedly allowed quick identification of critical control surface movements and their sources and other airplane system conditions that could have been involved in the loss of airplane control,\u201d the NTSB said in a 1999 report referencing those two crashes. \u201cThus, investigators would have been able to more quickly rule out certain factors, when warranted, and focus on other areas.\u201d The NTSB recommended regulators increase the requirements, which ultimately took effect in the early 2000s. Aircraft cockpits may one day contain a new generation of recording devices: video cameras.\u00a0The NTSB called for the cameras, saying it could help investigators understand the moments before an incident.\u00a0Some unions oppose the cameras, saying there are more effective and less invasive ways to obtain enough data.\u00a0US lawmakers abandoned a plan to include a cockpit video camera when crafting this year\u2019s expansive FAA legislation.",

But asked directly whether President Joe Biden thinks it\u2019s safe to fly, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre sidestepped. \u201cI think what he \u2013 I think what Americans should know is that (the Federal Aviation Administration) is doing everything that it can to make sure that Americans feel safe,\u201d Jean-Pierre told reporters during a press briefing Friday. She added that the FAA is taking actions \u201cto make sure that there is increased safety oversight of Boeing and that\u2019s what the American people should feel reassured by.\u201d Her comments came after several scary incidents involving planes manufactured by Boeing, including the terrifying plunge earlier this week involving a Latam Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner flight from Australia to New Zealand. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that a flight attendant may have inadvertently hit a switch on the pilot\u2019s seat while serving a meal, pushing the pilot into controls that altered the plane\u2019s flight, injuring dozens of passengers. CNN has yet to be able to confirm the Journal\u2019s report. \u201cThe investigation of Flight LA800 is ongoing and we defer to the investigation authorities on any potential findings,\u201d Boeing said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cWe have taken the precautionary measure of reminding 787 operators of a service bulletin issued in 2017 which included instructions for inspecting and maintaining switches on flight deck seats.\u201d And in January, a door plug blew out on a Boeing-manufactured Alaskan Airlines flight, leaving a gaping hole in the plane\u2019s fuselage. That incident resulted in a temporary nationwide grounding of certain 737 Max jets, followed by congressional hearings, production and delivery delays, multiple federal investigations \u2014 including a criminal probe \u2014 and a stock that has lost a quarter of its value this year, shaving more than $40 billion off the company\u2019s market valuation. The plug incident brought a renewed focus to the safety of Boeing commercial jets, a record that included\u00a0two fatal crashes\u00a0in 2018 and 2019 that killed a total of 346 people. Boeing has\u00a0accepted legal liability\u00a0for those crashes, which were attributed to a\u00a0design flaw\u00a0in the 737 Max. The\u00a0Justice Department\u00a0is now investigating whether or not the latest Boeing issues brought to light in the wake of the Alaska Air incident would violate a controversial\u00a0deferred prosecution agreement\u00a0the company reached in 2021, which could open the company for criminal liability.

            "text": "Boeing\u2019s problems aren\u2019t just Boeing\u2019s. They also could spell trouble for your wallet and the broader US economy. One of America\u2019s biggest manufacturers is dealing with some serious production, quality and safety problems that worsened this week after a\u00a0787 Dreamliner plunged suddenly mid-flight, injuring dozens of passengers. It\u2019s not yet clear whether Boeing was to blame, but it came at a horrible time for a company grappling with some severe damage to its already-battered reputation. Boeing\u2019s crisis could result in more expensive airfares and weaker economic growth, economists say. The aircraft manufacturer is a massive company with a workforce of more than 140,000 employees around the world, generating tens of billions in revenue each quarter as one of two global players in the production of planes, the other being Airbus. Boeing\u2019s production alone represents a significant part of America\u2019s economy. But the country \u2013 and the world \u2013 relies on its planes for travel, business, deliveries and jobs.  Delays in deliveries, which Boeing and several airlines expect as it undergoes an intensive federal investigation of its manufacturing processes, could reduce the number of planes available to Americans and cut into all those economy-boosting benefits its normally provides. More expensive airfares Boeing\u2019s mid-flight disasters, most notably an Alaska Airlines 737 Max door plug that\u00a0blew off the side of the plane\u00a0shortly after takeoff, clearly mean the company has issues to address. Boeing has already slowed down production of its popular 737 Max jets as regulators scrutinize the company\u2019s practices, which has already led to fewer flights being scheduled as airlines brace for snags in deliveries. The sharp 6.1% drop in new orders for durable goods in January was largely due to fewer order for Boeing jets. Boeing reported this week that it shipped a meager 17 Max jets in February, which was half as much the company shipped in December. Southwest and United earlier this week said they expect Boeing to ship them fewer planes than they planned on receiving, so they\u2019ll hire fewer pilots. Fewer jets could also push up airfares. \u201cLess supply of airplanes coming online means there\u2019s going to be more demand for flying than capacity is able to fulfill, so that keeps upward pressure on airfares, all else equal,\u201d Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, told CNN. \u201cWe have already seen airfares jump the last few months and it was up 3.6% in February.\u201d Boeing\u2019s need to address its problems means it likely won\u2019t cut back on hiring, even if demand for its planes weakens. \u201cI don\u2019t see them trimming labor at a time of serious quality concerns and if anything, Boeing might try to hire more to get the quality issues right,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, told CNN. Higher labor costs would mean Boeing loses even more money, plunging the company into an even deeper financial hole. That would inflict even further damage to Boeing\u2019s already-beaten down stock price. Weaker US economic growth and a boon for Airbus When regulators believed Boeing would halt production of the 737 Max jet in January 2020, after two fatal incidents in 2019 and the subsequent grounding of those jets that year, the New York Fed estimated that the production shutdown could shave 0.4% from US gross domestic product in 2020, the broadest measure of economic output. (Boeing continued to build the 737 Max throughout the crisis). Then, of course, the pandemic happened, which dealt an even tougher blow to the company, resulting in nearly $12 billion in losses that year. The New York Fed analysis stated that \u201cBoeing is a large firm that is highly integrated in the domestic production network\u201d and that production stoppages can \u201chave significant effects on the macroeconomy.\u201d Since Boeing is the single largest US exporter, weaker demand for its planes would means fewer exports, which contribute to GDP growth if they exceed imports \u2014 known as \u201cnet exports.\u201d Boeing hasn\u2019t announced that it will stop producing any of its aircraft outright, but its plans to increase production of the 737 Max are on hold as the Federal Aviation Administration awaits for the company\u2019s plan on how to end its continued quality issues. And Boeing\u2019s years of problems have led to success for its French rival Airbus, which has overtaken Boeing as the world\u2019s largest aircraft manufacturer. It\u2019s not easy for airlines to switch manufacturers overnight, but the trend is clearly pointing in Airbus\u2019 favor, and if US imports of Airbus planes for domestic carriers pick up as Boeing indeed suffers weaker demand, that would then weigh on America\u2019s GDP. \u201cThe declining demand of plane orders by airlines for Boeing aircrafts might just get directed towards Airbus instead, and doesn\u2019t just disappear,\u201d Lisa Simon, chief economist at\u00a0Revelio Labs, wrote in a statement to CNN. She added that \u201cthis whole fiasco absolutely will likely have adverse effects on the aircraft manufacturing sector in the US\u201d and that it would be \u201cgood for the European market.\u201d",

So how does CEO Dave Calhoun still have a job? \u201cIt\u2019s become an extreme embarrassment,\u201d Richard Aboulafia, a longtime aviation analyst, told me. \u201cThe board seems weirdly absentee, investors seem weirdly complacent, and the government doesn\u2019t seem to have a mechanism for dealing with this.\u201d Let\u2019s step back: Boeing\u2019s (BA) stock has shed more than a quarter of its value this year, and it\u2019s only March. One of its planes suffered a mid-flight blowout on January 5, prompting multiple federal investigations that increasingly suggest Boeing workers failed to put crucial bolts in place after making repairs. Last week, investigators called the company out for dragging its heels in response to their requests for key evidence. Boeing said it is working closely with regulators\u2019 investigations and has plans in place to improve safety measures at its production facilities. \u201cWe will continue supporting this investigation in the transparent and proactive fashion we have supported all regulatory inquiries into this accident,\u201d Boeing said in a statement. Boeing\u2019s 737 Max problems would be egregious enough on their own. But wait, there\u2019s more. On Monday, a Boeing\u00a0787 Dreamliner flying from Australia to New Zealand\u00a0plunged suddenly mid-flight,\u00a0injuring 50 passengers before landing safely. On Tuesday, news began emerging that a Boeing whistleblower, John Barnett, died in an apparent suicide on the same day he was scheduled to give testimony about safety concerns he raised over the company\u2019s safety protocols. It\u2019s not clear whether Boeing bears any responsibility in either case. The company said it was gathering information about what went wrong on the 787. And in response to its former employee\u2019s death, the company said: \u201cWe are saddened by Mr. Barnett\u2019s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.\u201d  Boeing lost its way If Boeing were any other company, its CEO would be out the door. But Dave Calhoun, Boeing\u2019s chief executive since 2020, remains in his job, as does the entire C-suite at the time of this writing. \u201cIt\u2019s been three years of \u2018there\u2019s no way Calhoun can stay at the helm,\u2019\u201d said Aboulafia, managing director of the consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory. \u201cBut he seems to be staying at the helm \u2026 I do not get it.\u201d Boeing actually raised Calhoun\u2019s total compensation in 2022, to $22.5 million, despite problems with the 777 program and quality control issues with the 787 that forced regulators to halt the company\u2019s deliveries. Calhoun\u2019s 2023 compensation has not yet been announced \u2014 Boeing typically reveals that information in April. To be fair to Calhoun, he took over a company in deep distress following two fatal 737 Max crashes that landed the crucial plane in a nearly two-year-long grounding and put the company in a yearslong crisis. And the plane maker\u2019s problems didn\u2019t start there: The 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas is widely cited as Boeing\u2019s poisoned chalice. It was after the merger that the bean-counter executives began taking over, gutting the joint, and putting accountants into roles once held by engineers. Maximizing profit took precedence over quality. In the short term, margins improved. But in the long term, Boeing lost the plot. Executives at Boeing, starting in the mid-aughts, \u201cidentified an industry with tons of cash flow, high barriers to entry and only two players,\u201d Aboulafia said, referring to Boeing\u2019s European rival, Airbus. \u201cIt\u2019s a recipe for getting away with bad things.\u201d Critics of the 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 weren\u2019t just a problem of flawed design but also deeply flawed management that eroded Boeing\u2019s corporate culture. Boeing hired Calhoun to right the ship and help return the plane maker to its engineering roots. Some questioned the move at the time, given that Calhoun himself was trained as an accountant and has no engineering background. Calhoun, who previously worked at the Blackstone Group, Nielsen and GE, was cut from the same cloth as Jim McNerney, who ran Boeing as CEO from 2005-2015, a tumultuous era marked by strained labor relations and cost-cutting. Under Calhoun, Boeing still hasn\u2019t been able to shake its enormous problems. This year\u2019s mounting concerns prove his efforts haven\u2019t resulted in sufficient quality and safety improvements. CNN has reached out to Boeing for comment. \u201cIf you ask me, the first thing that needs to happen for Boeing to gain trust is to basically fire the entire C suite,\u201d Gad Allon, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Business, told me Tuesday. \u201cI know that will not happen, but \u2026 there is not a single person that has a C in front of their title that is not responsible for what we\u2019re seeing now.\u201d But Allon isn\u2019t holding his breath for Boeing\u2019s board of directors to act. \u201cIf there is a functioning board, that\u2019s what should happen.\u201d",

            "text": "A SpaceX Starship rocket launched on its third test flight from the Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas, and achieved multiple milestones Thursday morning before likely breaking apart. The deep-space rocket system went through nearly an hour-long integrated flight test. The spacecraft was expected to splash down in the Indian Ocean at the conclusion of the flight, putting the gargantuan vehicle in a position to move on to more complex test flights and, eventually, carry NASA astronauts to the moon\u2019s surface. But after reentry the team lost two key pieces of communication at the same time: Contact with Starlink, SpaceX\u2019s internet service, and with TDRSS \u2014 or Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System. \u201cThe team has made the call that the ship has been lost, so no splashdown today,\u201d said Dan Huot, SpaceX communications manager, during the live broadcast. \u201cBut again, just it\u2019s incredible to see how much further we got this time around.\u201d SpaceX also never intended to recover Starship after this flight test. The spacecraft was expected to make a hard landing. And the Starship spacecraft made it much farther into flight than during two previous tests in 2023. The company routinely frames failures during these early test flights as normal. The goal of these flight tests is to gather crucial data so that engineers can go back and tinker with Starship, improving it for future missions. The Starship vehicle \u2014 which includes the upper Starship spacecraft and a rocket booster known as the Super Heavy \u2014 took off from SpaceX\u2019s private Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas, at 8:25 a.m. CT (9:25 a.m. ET). SpaceX considers the Starship system crucial to its founding mission: to carry humans to Mars for the first time. And critically, NASA has chosen Starship as the landing vehicle that will ferry its astronauts to the lunar surface on the Artemis III mission\u00a0slated to take off as soon as September 2026. \u201cCongrats to SpaceX on a successful test flight! Starship has soared into the heavens. Together, we are making great strides through Artemis to return humanity to the Moon\u2014 then look onward to Mars,\u201d wrote NASA Administrator Bill Nelson on X, formerly known as Twitter. The Super Heavy booster \u2014 the first stage, or bottommost part, of the launch vehicle roared to life and soared out over the Gulf of Mexico. The Super Heavy booster burned through most of its fuel and broke away from the Starship spacecraft, the upper stage that rides atop the Super Heavy. The booster was expected to make an autonomous, controlled landing in the ocean, but the booster \u201cdidn\u2019t light all the engines that we expected and we did lose the booster,\u201d Huot said. SpaceX said it\u2019s working to get video of what occurred before the booster hit the water. But the the booster made it farther into flight than a Super Heavy booster has previously made it. On the past two flights, Super Heavy was destroyed midair before it had a chance to try out landing maneuvers. Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the \u201cmishap\u201d involving both the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft. The agency licenses commercial rocket launches and oversees mishap investigations when spacecraft are lost during flight. Such investigations are routine and carried out whether or not SpaceX expects a loss of the vehicle. \u201cA mishap occurred during the SpaceX Starship OFT-3 mission that launched from Boca Chica, Texas, on March 14,\u201d according to a statement released by the FAA. \u201cNo public injuries or public property damage have been reported. The FAA is overseeing the SpaceX-led mishap investigation to ensure the company complies with its FAA-approved mishap investigation plan and other regulatory requirements.\u201d The third test flight occurred on SpaceX\u2019s 22nd anniversary, according to the livestream. Aiming for orbital speeds SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said a primary goal of these early test flights is to get Starship to orbital speeds \u2014 velocities quick enough to allow the spacecraft to enter a stable orbit around Earth. Typically, such a feat requires speeds topping 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 kilometers per hour). Starship reached its orbital speeds goal and did not aim to actually enter orbit on this flight. Starship tests and tech demos Starship burned its engine for about six minutes before it entered a coasting phase. The spacecraft ran through a few key tests and tech demonstrations. First, Starship reached speeds close to what would be required to put the vehicle in orbit. The Starship\u2019s payload door \u2014 a hatch that must open for the spacecraft to deploy satellites into space after reaching orbit \u2014\u00a0also swung open before resealing in a crucial test of that mechanism. SpaceX also carried out what the company is calling a \u201cpropellant transfer demonstration.\u201d The goal was to move some of the propellant on board the Starship vehicle from one tank to another, according to a December email from NASA explaining the test. SpaceX engineers designed that demo to begin hashing out how Starship will be refueled on future missions while it\u2019s in orbit. The team will \u201cneed to do some data review\u201d of both the payload door opening and the propellant transfer demonstration to determine how successful each test was, according to the live broadcast. However, after reaching several milestones, SpaceX revealed it opted not to attempt to reignite Starship\u2019s engines after a half-hour coasting phase that was originally planned for the flight test. Starship was on a \u201cpretty steep trajectory,\u201d Huot said. That meant Earth\u2019s gravity would likelrapidly drag Starship back toward Earth, whether or not engines are relit. It\u2019s not clear why SpaceX decided to forgo that test, but engineers noted a lot of data needs to be evaluated in the hours and days ahead. \u201cThe atmosphere is actually doing us a huge favor here by acting as a braking system for starship,\u201d said Kate Tice, one of the hosts of SpaceX\u2019s livestream. The Starship spacecraft is coated in about 18,000 lightweight, ceramic hexagon tiles designed to protect the vehicle from the scorching-hot temperatures as it plunges back into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. During the livestream, a vibrant halo of bright red plasma, created by extreme heat and pressure as Starship entered the atmosphere, could be seen glowing around the vehicle. Shortly after, the team lost communication with the spacecraft. NASA Artemis moon mission Topping off the spacecraft\u2019s fuel will be critical for Starship\u2019s high-profile missions down the road. When Starship makes a journey to the moon under NASA\u2019s Artemis program \u2014 it will have to sit in orbit close to Earth as SpaceX launches separate vehicles \u00a0that will transport only fuel to the spacecraft. To get to the moon, SpaceX may have to make more than a dozen refueling trips. SpaceX received approval from regulators on Wednesday to carry out this latest test flight. SpaceX\u2019s explosive test-flight process Musk has said he was more confident this flight will be successful compared with the 2023 attempts. A success would potentially give the company crucial data that could allow Starship to move on to more difficult test flights. \u201cI don\u2019t want to jinx it, but I think the probability of reaching orbit is good \u2014 80%,\u201d he said during a recent talk posted to social media. \u201cCertainly the third flight is a much better rocket than flights one or two.\u201d Still, SpaceX officials have repeatedly said the company does not expect 100% accuracy on these early test flights. \u201cEach of these flight tests continue to be just that: a test. They aren\u2019t occurring in a lab or on a test stand, but are putting flight hardware in a flight environment to maximize learning,\u201d the company said in a statement posted to its website. \u201cThis rapid iterative development approach has been the basis for all of SpaceX\u2019s major innovative advancements.\u201d",

The once red-hot electric vehicle maker \u2014 heralded as part of the so-called Magnificent Seven behemoth tech stocks \u2014 is currently the worst performer in the S&P 500 this year, down nearly 32% since January. The story of Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) decline has been well documented. The company has been plagued by safety issues and recalls, slowing growth and has even been forced to slash prices. But a new report by Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan on Wednesday offers a darker picture than previously imagined. Tesla, he wrote, is a \u201cgrowth company with no growth.\u201d Langan predicts that Tesla\u2019s growth will remain flat this year and then decline in 2025 as competition increases, deliveries disappoint and the beleaguered auto and tech company is forced to cut prices again. UBS also downgraded its forecast for Tesla on Wednesday. Analysts said concerns are mounting as demand for electric vehicles slows and as Chinese rivals take an ever greater share of the global market. With the exception of Tesla, all of the Magnificent Seven companies (that also includes Apple, Amazon, Meta, Google, Nvidia and Microsoft) saw double- or triple-digit earnings growth in the final three months of 2023. Tesla reported a 40% decline in profit from the year before. Tesla has been navigating through a perfect storm. The EV environment is getting more crowded right as the company\u2019s fundamentals have come into question. Its share price has dropped about 60% from its 2021 all-time high of $407. But even with the recent drop in price, Tesla\u2019s stock is still very expensive when compared to its actual earnings and profits, said Langan. The company\u2019s former propensity for rapid growth is no longer certain, he said, and shares likely have further  to fall. Wells Fargo has lowered its price target for the stock from $200 to $125, predicting another 25% decrease in value. UBS, meanwhile, has lowered its price target to a more moderate $165 from $225.",

The British Airways Concorde, one of only 20 of the supersonic aircraft to ever fly, has been en route back to NYC\u2019s Intrepid Museum after being sanded and recoated during several months of restoration. The delta-wing jet, which has been a hallmark of the aviation and maritime museum since 2003, made its way along the river aboard a barge, with an overnight stop in Jersey City, New Jersey. It was due to be unloaded by crane early on Thursday at the river\u2019s Pier 86, with the event streamed live on the museum\u2019s social media. Intrepid says its Concorde holds the world speed record for a passenger aircraft, having reached 1,354 miles per hour \u2013 more than twice the speed of sound \u2013 flying New York to London in 2 hours, 52 minutes and 59 seconds in 1996. The aircraft, call sign G-BOAD, first took to the skies in 1976 and once flew a service operated jointly by British Airways and Singapore Airlines, uniquely wearing the liveries of both carriers for a time, according to HeritageConcorde.com It made its last flight in 2003, on its way to Intrepid. The fleet of Concordes was gradually phased out in the wake of an August 2000 incident in which a Concorde crashed shortly after takeoff in Paris, killing all 109 people on board. The last ever flight by a Concorde was made on November 26, 2003. That aircraft, known as Delta Foxtrot, is now housed in Aerospace Bristol, an aviation museum in the west of England. Tours of Intrepid\u2019s Concorde will resume on April 4, the museum says. CNN\u2019s Barry Neild contributed to this story",

            "text": "SpaceX is once again set to fly its gargantuan Starship rocket \u2014 the most powerful launch vehicle ever constructed \u2014 after federal regulators approved the company\u2019s plans for a third test flight. The launch could take place anytime during a 110-minute window that opens at 7 a.m. CT (8 a.m. ET) Thursday, according to an email from SpaceX sent Wednesday afternoon. A live stream of the event will begin on the company\u2019s website about 30 minutes before takeoff. The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, gave SpaceX the final green light for the mission on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cThe FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental, policy and financial responsibility requirements,\u201d the agency said in a statement. This test flight comes after two attempts to get the massive Starship vehicle to orbital speeds in 2023 ended in explosions, with the spacecraft and booster erupting into flames before reaching their intended landing sites. SpaceX is known to embrace fiery mishaps in the early stages of spacecraft development, saying these failures help the company rapidly implement design changes that lead to better results. Much is riding on Starship\u2019s eventual success. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly characterized the rocket as central to the company\u2019s founding mission: putting humans on Mars for the first time. Crucially, the Starship spacecraft is also the vehicle NASA has\u00a0selected\u00a0to land astronauts launched from the United States on the moon for the first time in more than five decades as part of its Artemis program. The space agency is\u00a0in a race with China, vying to become first to develop a permanent lunar outpost and\u00a0set the precedent\u00a0for deep-space settlements. The US space agency has committed to investing up to $4 billion in Starship. Under NASA\u2019s current road map, Starship would complete the final leg of the agency\u2019s crewed mission to the moon, taking the astronauts from their spacecraft in lunar orbit and ferrying them down to the surface. The first astronaut landing under the Artemis program is slated to occur as soon as September 2026. What success looks like for SpaceX Musk has indicated that he believes Starship has a high chance of successfully completing this third test flight. \u201cI don\u2019t want to jinx it, but I think the probability of reaching orbit is good \u2014 80%,\u201d he said during a recent talk posted to social media. \u201cCertainly the third flight is a much better rocket than flights one or two.\u201d Musk said before the last Starship test flight in November that the vehicle had about a 50% chance of success. The vehicle was not meant to orbit Earth, but it was intended to reach the breakneck speeds that will be required when the vehicle does go into orbit. (Starship ultimately hit about 24,000 kilometers per hour, or 15,000 miles per hour. Reaching orbit typically requires hitting at least 17,500\u00a0miles per hour.) The November test flight marked a big improvement compared with Starship\u2019s inaugural liftoff in April 2023, when some of the rocket\u2019s 33 main engines flamed out and the vehicle began tumbling over the Gulf of Mexico. SpaceX destroyed the rocket just four minutes into that first flight to prevent it from veering off course. Starship made it much further in November, successfully igniting all its engines and completing a key flight milestone: stage separation. That\u2019s when the Super Heavy rocket booster \u2014 the bottommost portion of the rocket that gives the initial burst of power at liftoff \u2014 breaks away from the upper Starship spacecraft, allowing the vehicle to ignite its engines and continue the mission on its own power. But ultimately Starship was destroyed about 10 minutes into flight. If it had gone to plan, the mission would have lasted about an hour and a half. SpaceX has said its approach to rocket development is geared toward speed. The company makes use of an engineering method called \u201crapid spiral development.\u201d This process essentially boils down to a desire to build prototypes quickly and willingly blow them up to learn how to construct a better one \u2014 faster than if the company solely relied on ground tests and simulations. After the first and second Starship test flights ended in explosions, the company immediately\u00a0sought to frame these mishaps as successes. In a statement after the November launch, SpaceX said, \u201cWith a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today\u2019s test will help us improve Starship\u2019s reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multiplanetary.\u201d",

The black boxes hold data crucial to understanding what caused the Boeing jet to suddenly drop during the flight from Australia to New Zealand, causing dozens of passengers to be treated for injuries. The technical glitch and subsequent investigations come at a fraught time for Boeing. The US manufacturer has faced harsh criticism for a series of recent safety and quality issues in its aircraft. A series of investigations Chile\u2019s Directorate General of Civil Aeronautics (DGAC)\u00a0is leading the investigation into the black boxes as the plane was registered in the country. New Zealand\u2019s Transport Accident Investigation Commission\u00a0(TAIC), will also contribute an investigator to the process. The Boeing jet remains in Auckland and will also be assessed by the Chilean investigators. The union representing the flight\u2019s crew said on Wednesday that it would conduct an investigation, we well. The LATAM Cabin Crew Union (STCLA) said in a statement to CNN Wednesday that it is \u201cgathering records of its colleagues who were injured\u201d during the incident. According to a statement published by LATAM Airlines, at least 10 passengers and three crew members were injured when the plane experienced a \u201ctechnical event.\u201d However, emergency medical services provider Hato Hone St John Ambulance in Auckland told CNN that approximately 50 people were treated for injuries upon arrival in Auckland, including one person in serious condition. Pilot may have temporarily lost control of the jet One of the passengers aboard the Chilean Boeing 787, Brian Jokat, told CNN that the pilot checked on the passengers and explained he had temporarily lost control of the jet. \u201cI immediately engaged with him and said, \u2018What was that?\u2019 And he openly admitted, he said, \u2018I lost control of the plane. My gauges just kind of went blank on me,\u2019\u201d Jokat said. STCLA told CNN that it is awaiting the results of the investigation \u201cnot only to know what happened, but also to be able to ask the company for any necessary improvements.\u201d CNN contacted LATAM Airlines Wednesday but has not received a comment. \u201cAviation is a complex activity, it involves significant risks and must be carried out safely, so carrying out our work with appropriate conditions is also guaranteeing the safety of aviation as a whole,\u201d STCLA said in its statement. A nightmare for Boeing Analysis of the LATAM Airline flight\u2019s black box data could shed light on Boeing\u2019s role in the flight\u2019s sudden drop. Boeing is in crisis after a series of mid-flight disasters in recent months have led to intense scrutiny of its quality standards. In January, a door plug blew off a new Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines, leaving a hole in the side of the plane mid-flight. Investigators from the US National Transportation Safety Board said evidence showed four bolts that are meant to hold the door plug were missing. On Wednesday, in a letter to a Senate committee probing Boeing, the National Transportation Safety Board said its investigation has been held back by Boeing\u2019s lack of a paper trail for key evidence. The most serious problem Boeing faced in recent years: two fatal crashes of its 737 Max jet due to a design flaw in the plane. Meanwhile, in February, the Federal Aviation Administration flagged safety issues with engine anti-ice systems on the 737 Max and larger 787 Dreamliner. \ufeffThe FAA said Monday it has given Boeing until late May to produce a plan to remedy issues identified in a federal audit and other reviews, including a safety culture survey of employees and a separate panel report that found workers concerned about retaliation for reporting safety concerns. - CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore, Kathleen Magramo,\u00a0Manveena Suri\u00a0and\u00a0Alex Stambaugh contributed to reporting.",

Despite interviewing employees who work at Boeing\u2019s Renton, Washington facility that assembles the 737 Max, as well as collecting other paperwork, the National Transportation Safety Board says it has not determined who in Boeing\u2019s factory worked on the door plug that left the factory with missing bolts and later blew out on an Alaska Airlines passenger flight in January. Boeing recently said it has searched for records but believes its employees did not document the work. \u201cThe absence of those records will complicate the NTSB\u2019s investigation moving forward,\u201d NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy wrote in a letter to the Senate committee that is also probing Boeing. The letter noted that Boeing has also been unable to provide security footage of the September 2023 work, which included removing and reinstalling the door plug.\u00a0Homendy told the Senate Commerce Committee last week that her investigators noticed Boeing \u201csecurity cameras all over the facility,\u201d but that they were told the footage is kept for only 30 days. Boeing told CNN that 30-day record retention policy for security camera footage is standard practice. The letter revealed that the NTSB\u2019s first request to Boeing for relevant employees\u2019 names came on January 9 \u2014 four days after the mid-flight incident.\u00a0On February 2, the NTSB says Boeing provided \u201cnames of individuals who may provide insight regarding the work performed.\u201d NTSB said it requested another list of names on March 2 as it prepared for a series of interviews with Boeing employees last week. Homendy wrote that the agency is not looking to speak with employees for punitive purposes. \u201cOur only intent is to identify deficiencies and recommend safety improvements so accidents like this never happen again,\u201d she wrote. Homendy signaled that the back-and-forth with Boeing over the names of specific employees is complicating the investigation and said the NTSB would work to protect employees who come forward. \u201cI have become increasingly concerned that the focus on the names of individual front-line workers will negatively impact our investigation and discourage such Boeing employees from providing NTSB with information relevant to this investigation,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTo that end, I have instructed NTSB to utilize our authority to protect the identities of the door crew and other front-line employees who come forward with information relevant to the investigation.\u201d Boeing, in response, said it will work with the NTSB to help the probe. \u201cWe will continue supporting this investigation in the transparent and proactive fashion we have supported all regulatory inquiries into this accident,\u201d Boeing said, in a statement.

            "text": "It took decades for Boeing to build a reputation as one of the most reliable companies on the planet. It\u2019s taken less than six years to undo it all and leave the once-great American company facing an uncertain future. Regulators, airlines, fliers and even Boeing\u2019s own workers are practically in revolt after a series of mid-flight disasters and a steady erosion of the company\u2019s quality standards. Investors are none too thrilled, either: Boeing\u2019s stock (BA) is down 27% for the year, making it the second-worst performer in the S&P 500, behind Tesla. The latest headache for Boeing came Monday, when a\u00a0787 Dreamliner flying from Australia to New Zealand\u00a0plunged suddenly mid-flight,\u00a0injuring several passengers. It\u2019s not clear what, if any, culpability Boeing has here \u2014 it said it\u2019s gathering information about what went wrong. But the accounts from passengers are hardly flattering at a moment when Boeing is already under federal investigation for the Jan. 5 door-plug blowout. Brian Jokat, a passenger on Monday\u2019s Latam Airlines flight, told CNN he was jolted awake when the plane began falling so suddenly that people were tossed into the cabin ceiling. (In a separate interview with\u00a0The Wall Street Journal, he said: \u201cYou know in\u00a0The Exorcist, when the girl flies from the bed and hits the ceiling? It\u2019s exactly that scene.\u201d ) For any other company, now would be the time to call the lawyers and start working on a sale or a bankruptcy. Within the past six years, Boeing has been found responsible for two fatal crashes that killed 346 people, lost tens of billions of dollars, paid billions more in fines and settlements, and it made headlines for repeated quality control problems. But Boeing is not any other company. And it barely even has regulators to stand up to. The FAA is so underfunded that it has\u00a0partially\u00a0relied on Boeing to self-regulate.\u00a0It\u2019s a wonder that the agency found this week that Boeing failed half of its audit of its production facility. (The FAA has instructed the plane maker to submit a plan to fix its production problems by late May.) Boeing, in a statement, said it is working diligently to work out the issues highlighted by the FAA. \u201cBased on the FAA audit, our quality stand downs and the recent expert panel report, we continue to implement immediate changes and develop a comprehensive action plan to strengthen safety and quality, and build the confidence of our customers and their passengers,\u201d Boeing said in a statement. \u201cWe are squarely focused on taking significant, demonstrated action with transparency at every turn.\u201d Too big to fail The company is often called a duopoly, not a monopoly, because it is, technically, competing globally with its European rival Airbus. But it\u2019s not a true competition. Boeing\u2019s main customers are airlines, which can\u2019t suddenly switch to Airbus if they\u2019re upset with Boeing. Pilots are certified in one or the other, so once you make your choice, you\u2019re pretty much stuck with it. Given Boeing\u2019s singular importance in the American aviation industry, it is the definition of Too Big to Fail. Boeing is immune to most of the forces, like consumer choice, that other companies must contend with to stay in business. We the people couldn\u2019t get rid of it if we wanted to. So, how do we solve a problem like Boeing? \u201cIf you ask me, the first thing that needs to happen for Boeing to gain trust is to basically fire the entire C suite,\u201d Gad Allon, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Business, told me Tuesday. \u201cI know that will not happen, but \u2026 there is not a single person that has a C in front of their title that is not responsible for what we\u2019re seeing now.\u201d Allon isn\u2019t holding his breath for Boeing\u2019s board of directors on that front. Another idea that\u2019s occasionally bandied about: Nationalize Boeing. Matt Stoller, the director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project, a progressive think tank,\u00a0made that case in January\u00a0in his newsletter, arguing that the government has a history of nationalizing utilities, railroads and aerospace firms. And after all, he notes, Boeing already counts about 40% of its revenue from government contracts and much of the rest from plane orders that US officials regularly peddle abroad. \u201cBoeing is a state-backed national champion,\u201d Stoller wrote. \u201cThe fairy tale of a private firm is only hindering a fix to this once-great organization.\u201d Of course, Boeing isn\u2019t in the kind of financial distress that typically precedes a government takeover (a fact that\u2019s also courtesy of years of government support, but still). Nationalization seems politically interesting but practically unlikely. \u201cThere\u2019s really no short- and mid-term good option,\u201d Allon says. The bigger concern, for him, is what happens when these one-off scary events \u2014 door plugs ripping away mid-flight, etc \u2014 start becoming more frequent. \u201cThis can be really as big as a financial crisis,\u201d considering how many businesses around the world rely on Boeing planes. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I think that there is a risk of all of these planes falling from the sky tomorrow \u2026 [But] the moment we start seeing these things as more recurring, I think it moves from being an \u2018event risk\u2019 to a \u2018continuous risk\u2019 \u201d that could have devastating consequences.",

Although Alaska Airlines did not say why the plane was set to be taken out of service, the airline told the\u00a0New York Times, which first reported the scheduled safety check, that the plane was set to be removed from service to investigate two separate warning lights that alerted the crew to a potential pressurization problem on the plane over the 10 days prior to the blowout. Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, told CNN on January 8 that she was aware the plane had pressurization issues before the door plug blew out, and the safety regulator planned on probing Alaska Airlines about the incident. But the NTSB later clarified that it believed the pressurization warnings were unrelated to the side of the plane blowing out mid-air. The NTSB said the warning started appearing just weeks after the plane was delivered, in early December, and most recently happened the day before the door plug blowout incident. Max Tidwell, the vice president for safety and security for Alaska Airlines, told the New York Times that the airline did not believe the indicator lights posed a serious enough problem to take the plane out of service sooner without carrying passengers. Such deferred maintenance is common and legal, and the plane had made 154 successful flights before the blowout. In its preliminary investigation, the NTSB found that Boeing\u00a0probably did not put required bolts\u00a0in the door plug. The bolts are designed to prevent that part from blowing off the plane. It\u2019s not clear that an expedited maintenance schedule would have led Alaska Airlines to discover that problem. However, engineers were concerned enough about the warning lights that the airline prevented the plane from carrying passengers on long-haul routes over water in case of emergency, according to The New York Times. \u201cThe U.S. aviation system is the safest in the world because it relies on layers: redundant systems, robust processes and procedures, and the willingness to stop and ensure things are right before every takeoff,\u201d Alaska Airlines said in a statement. \u201cWe remain confident in our maintenance and safety actions leading up to the incident. We look forward to continuing our participation in a robust investigation led by the NTSB to ensure something like this never happens again.\u201d Alaska Airlines\u2019 (ALK) stock fell marginally in after-hours trading. The airline has largely avoided heavy scrutiny in the incident as blame has\u00a0largely been laid on Boeing\u00a0following the preliminary results of the probe. Boeing has been subject to congressional hearings, production and delivery delays, multiple federal investigations \u2014 including a criminal probe \u2014 and a stock that has lost more than a quarter of its value this year, shaving more than $40 billion off the company\u2019s market valuation. Although the revelation that the plane was scheduled for service the same day as the blowout does not necessarily suggest any wrongdoing by Alaska Airlines, it does raise further concerns about policies and regulations surrounding maintenance of America\u2019s fleet of aircraft.",

A news release from the Charleston County Coroner\u2019s Office said John Barnett, 62, died on March 9, from \u201cwhat appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\u201d The city\u2019s police department says detectives are investigating the case and \u201cawaiting the formal cause of death, along with any additional findings that might shed further light on the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Barnett.\u201d A statement provided to CNN by his lawyers says,\u00a0\u201cJohn was in the midst of a deposition in his whistleblower retaliation case, which finally was nearing the end. He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on. We didn\u2019t see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it.\u00a0We are all devasted [sic].\u00a0We need more information about what happened to John. The Charleston police need to investigate this fully and accurately and tell the public what they find out. No detail can be left unturned.\u201d His family told\u00a0NPR\u00a0the case was heading to trial in June, adding that Barnett was, \u201clooking forward to having his day in court and hoped that it would force Boeing to change its culture.\u201d The statement from his attorneys Robert Turkewitz and Brian Knowles described Barnett as \u201ca brave, honest man of the highest integrity. He cared dearly about his family, his friends, the Boeing company, his Boeing co-workers, and the pilots and people who flew on Boeing aircraft. We have rarely met someone with a more sincere and forthright character.\u201d A police incident report says officers were dispatched to conduct a welfare check at a Holiday Inn in Charleston shortly before 10:20 am on Saturday. When they arrived, responding officers found Barnett in the driver\u2019s seat of\u00a0a truck in the parking lot, with\u00a0a gunshot wound to the head.\u00a0He was holding a handgun. Barnett\u00a0was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. The police report also said there was a piece of paper found next to him that looked like a note. The incident report noted that the hotel had received a phone call from a \u201cRob,\u201d who requested the welfare check on \u201chis coworker John Barnett,\u201d which led hotel employees to the truck in the parking lot. The\u00a0BBC\u00a0reported that Barnett was in Charleston for legal interviews and\u00a0was scheduled for additional questioning on Saturday.\u00a0He was found dead after failing to appear. When reached for comment regarding Barnett\u2019s death, Boeing issued a statement saying, \u201cWe are saddened by Mr. Barnett\u2019s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.\u201d A statement from Charleston police indicated the department was aware the case has generated international attention, saying,\u00a0\u201cit is our priority to ensure that the investigation is not influenced by speculation but is led by facts and evidence. Given the sensitive nature of the investigation, we are unable to participate in media interviews at this time. This stance is not unique to this case but is a standard procedure we adhere to in order to preserve the integrity of active investigations.\u201d Barnett, a former quality manager who had worked at Boeing for decades, had\u00a0\u201cdiscovered clusters of metal slivers hanging over the wiring that commands the flight controls,\u201d according to a 2019 New York Times report\u00a0cited by CNN. Barnett told the Times that if those \u201csharp\u201d slivers \u201cpenetrated\u201d the wiring, the result could be \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d \u201cAs a quality manager at Boeing, you\u2019re the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public,\u201d Barnett told the Times. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I\u2019d put my name on saying it\u2019s safe and airworthy.\u201d In a statement sent to the plant\u2019s employees and provided to CNN at the time, Brad Zaback, a site leader at the plant and general manager of the 787 program, said the Times\u2019 report \u201cpaints a skewed and inaccurate picture of the program and of our team (at the plant).\u201d Zaback, who said the Times declined an invitation to visit the plant, said \u201cquality is the bedrock of who we are,\u201d adding that the plant delivers \u201cthe highest quality airplanes.\u201d",

            "text": "Boeing reported a minor bounce back in sales in February after orders ground essentially to a halt in January following the Alaska Airlines door plug incident. The troubled aircraft maker reported 15 commercial jet orders in the month. That\u2019s a rebound from just three jet orders in January. But the company also had three canceled orders in January, giving it zero net orders for that month, the worst month for sales in years. The news wasn\u2019t all good: One of Boeing\u2019s largest customers, Southwest, disclosed Tuesday it now expects its deliveries from Boeing to be down more than 40% from what it had planned to accept over the course of the year. That\u2019s due to ongoing safety and quality questions about Boeing\u2019s production line raised by the door plug incident on a January 5 Alaska Air flight that left a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Because of that, the total capacity of seats Southwest sells during the course of the year will be 1 percentage point less than it originally expected, the airline said. Despite the challenges, Southwest CEO Bob Jordan signaled Southwest is not keen on adding planes from the other major airline manufacturer \u2014 Airbus \u2014 to its fleet.\u00a0That move would be an enormous change for Southwest, which exclusively flies the Boeing 737 and in 2011 became Boeing\u2019s first customer for the jet\u2019s latest generation, the Max. Southwest is making adjustments for the year. Jordan said Tuesday that the company is halting the hiring of pilots and flight attendants due to Boeing\u2019s expectation to deliver far fewer planes to Southwest than expected this year. \u201cThis is not business as usual,\u201d Jordan said at a conference organized by JP Morgan.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re being very aggressive in controlling what we can control.\u201d The hiring cuts mean Southwest will hire about 50% fewer pilots and 60% fewer flight attendants than planned this year.\u00a0New hire classes for both types of employees will stop in April.\u00a0After growth fueled by the post-pandemic air travel recovery, Jordan said Southwest now expects to end the year \u201csolidly down\u201d in employee headcount. But Jordan said Southwest is playing the long game and will deal with the delivery delays for now. \u201cI,\u00a0and I know other CEOs,\u00a0have told Boeing \u2026 get the issues understood, and get the issues fixed,\u201d Jordan said.\u00a0\u201cFix it. We all need Boeing to be stronger two years from now, five years from now, ten years from now.\u00a0And that takes precedent over delivery delays.\u201d United Airlines also said recently that it would halt pilot hiring\u00a0\u201cdue to continued new aircraft certification and manufacturing delays at Boeing.\u201d Rebound from worst month since pandemic January had been the worst month for sales for Boeing since airlines were struggling with massive losses during the pandemic. The last time Boeing had between one and three gross orders was in June, 2020, when it had only one jet order. The last time that Boeing had zero or negative net orders was in January of 2021, when it had negative 1 net orders. So while 15 orders in February is an improvement, it\u2019s still sharply off from relatively strong sales it reported for 2023, as a return of passengers had airlines eager to order and take deliveries on new planes.  Boeing had 369 total net orders in December alone, a\u00a0record month for the company. For the full year it had 1,456 gross orders, or 121 a month on average, and 929 of those orders coming in the second half of last year as demand picked up, for an average of 155 a month. So 15 orders booked for February showed a sharp drop from 2023 demand levels. The company sold 10 of the troubled 737 Max jets in February, all to unidentified customers. It sold four of the 787 Dreamliner to Royal Brunei Airlines, a deal announced during the Singapore Airshow. And it sold one 777 freighter, also to an unidentified customer. Deliveries hurt by quality questions Deliveries were somewhat better, but also below normal output for the company. Boeing delivered 17 737 Max jets, including two each to United Airlines, Southwest and Ryanair, and one each to Air India, Akasa, flydubai, Korean Air, Sun Express, and one each to six Chinese airlines \u2013 Air China, and China Southern, Xiamen, Shandong, Donghai and 9 Air. Overall it delivered 27 commercial jets.  The deliveries to China were significant, as China had not taken any Max deliveries from Boeing for nearly five years, following a second fatal crash in March 2019 caused a two-year grounding of the plane in China. Even after Chinese airlines were cleared by Chinese aviation regulators to start flying the 737 Max jets they owned once again, the airlines there had not taken a delivery of a Max until late January, when China Southern accepted delivery of a Max. But as Boeing deals with quality and safety issues since the Alaska Air incident, its deliveries are likely to be slowed for the rest of this year. Last year it delivered 528 commercial jets, or an average of 44 a month. The FAA has announced that it will not approve Boeing\u2019s plans to increase production of the 737 Max until it is satisfied it has made improvement in safety and quality issues. Southwest, one of its major customers, disclosed Tuesday that it expects to take deliveries of 46 737 Max 8 jets this year, rather than its previous plan to take 58 of those planes. Southwest had planned to also take delivery of a total of 79 737 Max jets, but it no longer expects to get any of the 737 Max 7 jets it had hoped to get this year. That plane has yet to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration to carry passengers and is now not likely to get that approval this year as it originally hoped.",

            "text": "You\u2019d think Boeing\u2019s already miserable 2024 couldn\u2019t get any worse. But on Monday, a 787 Dreamliner plunged suddenly mid-flight, injuring dozens of passengers, after a pilot said he temporarily lost control of the aircraft. The pilot was able to recover and land the plane safely, but it\u2019s not yet clear what caused the LATAM flight from Australia to New Zealand to fall so dramatically. LATAM called it a \u201ctechnical event.\u201d Boeing said it\u2019s working to gather more information. But it\u2019s not news Boeing\u2019s management (or the flying public) needed right now. The company\u2019s nonstop streak of bad news began the first weekend of the year, when part of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max blew off the side of the plane just after takeoff. A preliminary federal investigation revealed that Boeing probably did not put the bolts in the so-called door plug that are designed to prevent the part from blowing off the plane. That incident resulted in a temporary nationwide grounding of certain 737 Max jets, followed by congressional hearings, production and delivery delays, multiple federal investigations \u2014 including a criminal probe \u2014 and a stock that has lost a quarter of its value this year, shaving more than $40 billion off the company\u2019s market valuation. Between lawsuits, potential fines and lost business, Boeing could lose billions more dollars from the blowout. But the bad news didn\u2019t stop there. In February, pilots on a United Airlines 737 Max reported that the flight controls jammed as the plane landed in Newark. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. Two weeks ago, the Federal Aviation Administration flagged safety issues with the de-icing equipment on 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner models that could cause engines to lose thrust. The FAA is allowing the planes to continue flying and Boeing said the problem does not pose an immediate safety risk. Then, last week, Boeing got more bad news: The NTSB said Boeing has not yet provided the company\u2019s records documenting the steps taken on the assembly line for the door plug replacement on the Alaska Airlines jet. Boeing\u2019s reason: Those records don\u2019t actually exist. And the FAA said Boeing\u2019s safety and quality problems extend beyond its inability to produce paperwork. Reviewing Boeing\u2019s production workflow and standards, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said Monday that the regulator found issues with \u201creally important\u201d aspects of Boeing\u2019s manufacturing and assembly line. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just paperwork issues,\u201d Whitaker said at a news conference.\u00a0\u201cSometimes, it\u2019s the order the work is done.\u00a0Sometimes it\u2019s tool management.\u00a0It sounds kind of pedestrian, but it\u2019s really important in a factory that you have a way of tracking your tools effectively so that you have the right tool and that you know you haven\u2019t left it behind.\u201d Boeing has said it is working on several of the issues Whitaker identified. The FAA has instructed the plane maker to submit a plan to fix its production problems by late May. \u201cBased on the FAA audit, our quality stand downs and the recent expert panel report, we continue to implement immediate changes and develop a comprehensive action plan to strengthen safety and quality, and build the confidence of our customers and their passengers,\u201d Boeing said in a statement. \u201cWe are squarely focused on taking significant, demonstrated action with transparency at every turn.\u201d Boeing\u2019s (BA) stock, which fell 3% Monday on the news about the terrifying LATAM flight, is down another 4.5% Tuesday. It\u2019s the second-worst performer in the S&P 500, behind only Tesla. But Boeing\u2019s awful start to 2024 is about much more than its stock price. The company came into the year with an already bruised reputation. Restoring the confidence of airlines, regulators and passengers becomes more difficult with every new incident and bad headline.

            "text": "The pilot of a\u00a0terrifying flight from Australia to New Zealand told those on board he temporarily lost control of his Boeing 787 after one of its instruments failed, a passenger said Monday, as\u00a0authorities investigate what caused a sudden drop that threw travelers around the cabin, injuring dozens. In accordance with rules outlined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Chile\u2019s Directorate General of Civil Aeronautics (DGAC) have sent investigators from the agency\u2019s Operations and Airworthiness team to look into the incident, according to a statement released on Tuesday. \u201cGiven that the State of Registration of the aircraft involved is Chilean, it has been established with the New Zealand Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) that the investigation will be carried out by the Chilean Aeronautical Authority,\u201d the statement read. The incident aboard\u00a0LATAM Airlines flight 800 from Sydney to Auckland is the latest to hit troubled aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which has been rocked by years of quality and safety issues. Passenger Brian Jokat described the horrifying moment when he was woken from his sleep as the aircraft \u201cdropped something to the effect of 500 feet instantly.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s when I opened my eyes and there was various individuals at the top of the plane. Just stuck to the roof and then they fell to the floor. And then I just realized I\u2019m not in a movie, this is actually for real,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. After landing in Auckland, Jokat said\u00a0the pilot checked on the passengers and explained he had temporarily lost control of the jet. \u201cI immediately engaged with him and said, \u2018What was that?\u2019 And he openly admitted, he said, \u2018I lost control of the plane. My gauges just kind of went blank on me,\u2019\u201d Jokat said. \u201cHe said for that brief moment he couldn\u2019t control anything and that\u2019s when the plane did what it did. Then he said the gauges came back and it reengaged, the plane just reengaged to its normal flight pattern. And we had no issues before, no issues after. But just that moment.\u201d The plane, operated by Chile\u2019s flag carrier, was a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. LATAM on Monday said the plane \u201chad a technical event during the flight which caused a strong movement,\u201d adding it had landed as scheduled in Auckland. In a statement to CNN Tuesday, Boeing said it was \u201cworking to gather more information about the flight and will provide any support needed by our customer.\u201d About 50 people were injured in the incident, with one person in serious condition, emergency services said. Jokat said he feared for his life when he saw fellow passengers fly out of their seats and hit the ceiling of the plane. \u201cPeople were screaming and crying. And yeah, it was mass chaos for a few short seconds,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly there was a moment in my head that I just kind of resigned to the fact this could be it. This might be it.\u201d Boeing\u2019s troubles As investigators scramble to discover what might have caused the sudden drop, the incident comes at a fraught time for Boeing. The US manufacturer has faced harsh criticism for a series of quality and safety issues in recent years, with many critics saying the company has shifted its focus in the last few decades to\u00a0financial results at the cost of safety and quality\u00a0in its aircraft. They include\u00a0two fatal crashes\u00a0of the 737 Max jet due to a design flaw in the plane, numerous halts in deliveries due to quality control issues and, most recently, a\u00a0door plug that blew off\u00a0of a new 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines in January, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration in February flagged safety issues with engine anti-ice systems on the 737 Max and larger 787 Dreamliner. The safety regulator continues to allow both models of the plane to fly despite the potential problems. Both issues are moving through the FAA\u2019s standard process for developing airworthiness directives \u2014 rather than an emergency process \u2014 signaling that the agency and plane maker do not believe the issues are serious enough to require the planes to stop flying immediately. The FAA said Monday it has given Boeing until late May to produce a plan to remedy issues identified in a federal audit and other reviews, including a safety culture survey of employees and a separate panel report that found workers concerned about retaliation for reporting safety concerns. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said he expects the company to produce \u201ca very detailed plan within the next 90 days to fix the quality issues that are out there.\u201d Boeing has said it is working on several of the issues Whitaker identified.",

            "text": "Michael Stumo\u2019s life changed forever on March 10, 2019. His daughter, Samya Rose Stumo, was killed that day when the Boeing 737 Max 8 she was on plunged into the ground just outside Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, six minutes after the plane took off. She was 24 years old. \u201cPart of our life is dead. Part of our future is dead,\u201d he told CNN, as the fifth anniversary of the crash approached. \u201cShe had it all. She was brilliant. She was the most published student in the Copenhagen School of Public Health. She taught herself to read before she was four. She went to college at 14. She was beautiful, charismatic. Her smile could light up the room. She was very caring. She would have been a star in the world of global health.\u201d Samya Rose was flying from Ethiopia to Kenya as part of her new job with a health systems development organization. Even though the same jet model had crashed soon after taking off from Indonesia less than six months earlier, aviation authorities around the world had allowed the 737 Max to keep flying with passengers. Michael Stumo said he never gave the plane or his daughter\u2019s flying plans much thought. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think about air travel. We didn\u2019t pay attention to the airline, the aircraft model,\u201d he said. \u201cWe pay hyper attention to planes now. We\u2019d never fly a Max.\u201d The March 10 anniversary is a difficult one for the families of the 157 people on board the Ethiopian jet, because concerns over Boeing\u2019s safety and quality have been in the news so much in the last two months. A third incident This year, on January 5, a part of a 737 Max 9 flown by Alaska Airlines blew out, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Fortunately, it was able to land minutes later without any fatalities or serious injuries. A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the plane had left a Boeing factory and was delivered to Alaska Air less than three months before, all while missing four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place.   Boeing has announced steps to improve safety and quality since the incident, including an all-employees safety meeting the week following the blowout, and shutting production at the Max factory for a day later that month to talk further about how to improve safety. But the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not satisfied: The regulator gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to deal with safety gaps. Some of the families of the Ethiopian crash victims welcomed the intense regulatory scrutiny on Boeing following January\u2019s door plug blowout. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re happy that it happened. But it\u2019s a mixed blessing. Something bad was going to happen, but in this case, nobody died,\u201d Stumo said. \u201cWith our crash it was focus on the design. It wasn\u2019t on the production chaos. The production problems really came to the fore this time.\u201d Zipporah Kuria, 28, who lost her 55-year-old father, Joseph, on the same flight, said her entire life was uprooted by the crash. \u201cI think my initial impression, what an unfortunate accident,\u201d she recalled about the 2019 crash. \u201cThen when I heard later that day this is not the first of these accidents, and that both were relatively new planes, my mind went to \u2018something\u2019s not right.\u2019\u201d Like Stumo, she became involved with trying to hold Boeing accountable for its failures, spending hours every week on the issue, reaching out to aviation regulators, speaking out publicly, and trying to bring more public attention to Boeing\u2019s production and safety problems. \u201cIt\u2019s robbed me of time and opportunity and peace of mind, and most importantly, my dad,\u201d she said this past week. \u201cI haven\u2019t had the capacity to fall in love and build a life with somebody else because this has been the center of my life. When I think \u2018I\u2019m going to focus on other parts of my life now,\u2019 a door falls off a plane and we\u2019re back in the Boeing circus.\u201d But like Stumo, Kruia says she is pleased that the Alaska Air incident has brought attention to the fact that the problems at Boeing were not fixed when the 737 Max planes returned to service after the 20-month grounding. Boeing\u2019s production problems went beyond the design flaw that led to the crashes. The company, for five years, has faced repeated quality and potential safety issues with its aircraft, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and the halt in deliveries of others. But the problems, including de-icing equipment that could fail on 737 and 787 Dreamliner planes, engine issues for the 777 and repeated quality control concerns for the 787\u2019s fuselage, failed to capture much attention from the public. The frightening door plug incident, however, shined a spotlight on the years of safety concerns at the company. \u201cWhen that happened, and everyone on the plane was fine, there was a relief,\u201d Kuria said. \u201cThis is the smoking gun we\u2019ve been waiting for the world to see, to wake up and have Boeing be exposed.\u201d Pressure for business as usual, and a deferred prosecution The victims\u2019 families, and the attorney who has represented many of them, are particularly angry that the Max continued to fly after the first accident demonstrated a design flaw, a problem with a single sensor that would push the nose of the jet down if it sensed an imminent stall. Boeing continued to insist that the plane was safe, not only after the first crash but for days after the second crash. Boeing only later admitted to the design flaw as part of the investigations and lawsuits that disclosed internal discussions about the problems with the design soon after the first crash. \u201cWithin days of the first crash, Boeing knew there was a design defect,\u201d Robert Clifford, one of the plaintiff attorneys in the case, told CNN. \u201cRather than alert all the operators about this defect, they believed they could get ahead of the curve. That\u2019s not what happened. They gambled with people\u2019s lives and the people lost.\u201d In 2021 Boeing\u00a0admitted to liability\u00a0in the two crashes, agreeing to pay compensatory damages, which allowed the company to avoid the possibility of having to pay far more in punitive damages. It also agreed to a controversial deferred prosecution agreement with the US Justice Department on charges that it defrauded the FAA when getting the original certification for the Max. Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion as part of the settlement \u2013 but most of that money was paid to the airlines as compensation for the 20-month grounding of the jets. Those were payments that Boeing had already agreed to make. Since the Alaska Air incident the Justice Department has started reviewing whether deficiencies found in the wake of the\u00a0door plug blowout\u00a0on a 737 Max flight violate that deferred prosecution agreement,\u00a0according to a person familiar with the investigation. The results of the probe could subject Boeing to criminal liability, depending on its outcome. Boeing acknowledged in a January regulatory filing that the Justice Department was looking at whether it had fulfilled the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement, but the company told CNN it had no further comment on the latest Justice Department probe. But beyond the many probes and audits and investigations of Boeing, many family members are still angry that the jet was allowed to start flying again after the company made changes to that system after a 20-month grounding. They say the Alaska Air incident demonstrates the problems at Boeing go much deeper than the design issue that was fixed. Some say they extend to production issues and to severe problems in the organizational structure at Boeing. The company declined to comment. Boeing\u2019s CEO Dave Calhoun acknowledged at a companywide safety meeting that the company made a mistake with the door plug blowout and the company has pledged to improve safety. Last month, Boeing removed executive Ed Clark, the head of its\u00a0737 Max\u00a0passenger jet program. \u2018A swampy cesspool\u2019 Since the Alaska Air incident, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a report that had been in the works for more than a year, sharply critical of the safety culture at Boeing. Despite statements from Boeing management about a renewed commitment to safety, the FAA found \u201csafety-related messages or behaviors are not being implemented across the entire Boeing population.\u201d The panel, which conducted more than 250 interviews and reviewed more than 4,000 pages of documents, found that among Boeing employees there was a \u201chesitation in reporting safety concerns for fear of retaliation\u201d because of management conflicts of interest. The report also said confusion about the safety programs \u201cmay discourage employees from submitting safety concerns.\u201d A separate FAA follow-up report focused on the Alaska Air incident and found multiple problems with Boeing\u2019s production practices. The agency has given Boeing\u00a090 days to produce the plan\u00a0to fix its quality issues. Boeing insists it is making a renewed commitment to safety and fixing production problems, and that the company is working to satisfy the concerns expressed by the FAA. Asked for a comment on the fifth anniversary of the Ethiopian crash, the company responded, \u201cWe will never forget the lives lost on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Lion Air Flight 610 and their loved ones. Their memory and the hard lessons we learned from these accidents drive us every day to uphold our responsibility to all who depend on the safety and quality of our products.\u201d But the victims\u2019 families are hardly satisfied with that statement or other apologies issued by Boeing and its executives over the last five years. They say they won\u2019t stop pushing for changes at Boeing until the top management at the company is replaced. \u201cThe blame lies with Boeing management. Until David Calhoun and Chief \u2018Safety\u2019 Officer Mike Delaney are gone, it won\u2019t change,\u201d Stumo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a swampy cesspool.\u201d Stumo and some other family members of victims met with previous Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg in 2019 after he testified about the crashes in Washington. Asked if he would like to meet with Calhoun, Stumo paused for a long moment before responding, \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d But Kuria said she\u2019d like to meet with Calhoun and other Boeing executives. \u201cJust to find out how these people sleep at night,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do you kiss your children and hug your wife knowing there\u2019s a group of families never get to do that because of the decisions made.\u201d",

Instead of basing most of white-collar employees\u2019 bonuses on financial results, bonuses will now be based mostly on safety and quality metrics. The company has faced harsh criticism for a series of quality and safety issues in recent years, with many of those critics saying the company has shifted its focus in the last few decades to financial results at the cost of safety and quality in its aircraft. But those safety and quality problems have resulted in five years of operating losses topping $31.5 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very important to drive the outcomes that we\u2019re all committed to, and that\u2019s to deliver a safe and quality product to our customer,\u201d said Chief Operating Officer Stephanie Pope on Thursday in comments to employees announcing the new bonus formulas. The troubled aircraft maker said 60% of the annual incentive score used to determine bonuses for employees of its commercial airplane unit will now be based on safety and quality metrics. It previously had 75% of that score based on financial results, with the other 25% based on operational metrics that included data beyond safety and quality readings. For the company\u2019s defense, space and security unit, as well as its global services division, operating metrics will continue to determine only 25% of the bonus formula, but that 25% will be changed to focus solely on safety and quality. For employees in the corporate offices, their bonus score will be based on an average of the three units scores. Among the safety and quality issues of recent years have been two fatal crashes of the 737 Max jet due to a design flaw in the plane, numerous halts in deliveries due to quality control issues and, most recently, a door plug that blew off of a new 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines in January of this year, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. The National Transportation Safety Board has determined that aircraft left a Boeing factory without the four bolts need to keep the door plug in place. It has yet to assess blame for the accident, but CEO Dave Calhoun has accepted responsibility for the incident. \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that,\u201d he told investors during a call after reporting the latest quarterly loss at the company. \u201cWhatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better.\u201d",

            "title": "10 years on, is the world any closer to finding MH370?",
            "text": "For the past 10 years it has remained one of the modern era\u2019s greatest mysteries. A commercial airliner with a strong safety record carrying 239 people vanishing from the map, spawning a wide variety of competing theories, books and documentaries and leaving the families of those left behind asking themselves every March 8 \u2013 what happened to those aboard Malaysia Airlines flight 370? In an era when black boxes have been successfully hauled up from the very depths of the ocean and whole chunks of a downed airliner painstakingly pieced back together to determine what caused a catastrophe, the fate of MH370 remains infuriatingly elusive. It is a plane crash without a plane. A disaster without conclusive proof of what happened to its victims. A story that anyone who embarks on a commercial flight can instantly relate to but one that, for now at least, doesn\u2019t have a closing chapter. Yet many experts believe there is still a strong chance MH370\u2019s wreckage could be located, if someone looks hard enough and \u2013 crucially \u2013 coughs up the staggering amount of money that might be required to achieve that goal. For Jiang Hui, who lost his mother in the disaster, this time of year is especially tough \u2013 and not just because of the March 8 anniversary. Qingming, the annual festival when Chinese people visit and clean their ancestors\u2019 graves, falls in early April. \u201cBut we never found MH370. I never found my mother,\u201d Jiang told CNN. \u201cI can\u2019t commemorate my mother just like everyone else.\u201d His mother, Jiang Cuiyun, is still listed as \u201cmissing\u201d back home in China, he said. \u201cI will only find my mom if I can find MH370,\u201d he added. Beijing-bound Malaysia Airlines flight 370 dropped off the radar shortly after departing Kuala Lumpur in the small hours of March 8, 2014. The take-off was uneventful. The flight reached its cruising altitude of 35,000 feet and the pilots spoke briefly with Vietnamese air traffic as the plane headed on its standard route. After that the aircraft stopped communicating, then vanished from radar when it made an unexpected turn to the west. Apparent fragments have since washed up on the eastern coast of Africa and islands in the Indian Ocean, where the aircraft and those on board are believed to have met their fate. But to this day, the body of the aircraft and its black box has never been found. It\u2019s believed to have crashed. But we still don\u2019t know why. A new search? This week, many loved ones of those missing returned to Malaysia to urge local authorities to relaunch a search ahead of Friday\u2019s anniversary. \u201cThere have been ships lost that are found after hundreds of years. So we cannot say that this plane will never be found,\u201d one family member V.P.R Nathan told Reuters during a recent commemorative event. His wife Anne Daisy was on board MH370. \u201cOf course it can be found. It is a matter of time,\u201d he said. Aviation experts tell CNN that improved detection technology will likely bring families closer to the missing plane than they ever have been, if a search were to be relaunched. But that will not be cheap. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent scouring more than 710,000 square kilometers of the Indian Ocean until 2018, but nothing transpired that moved our understanding on from that already available since the very early days. United States-based sea exploration firm Ocean Infinity is offering the Malaysian government another \u201cno-find, no-fee\u201d deal - like they did in 2018 - but experts noted the authorities would still have to pay up if the aircraft was found. To families\u2019 encouragement, Malaysian authorities have made some positive remarks about the prospect of a new search. On Sunday, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said his country would \u201cdo everything possible to solve this mystery once and for all.\u201d He said his ministry is \u201cready\u201d to discuss a new \u201ccredible\u201d search proposal with Ocean Infinity and will do \u201ceverything possible\u201d to get Cabinet approval for a new contract with the firm. \u201cAs we approach the 10 years remembrance of this heart-wrenching tragedy, it is a painful reminder of the decade-long journey of grief and resilience that loved ones of the victims have endured,\u201d he said. Oliver Plunkett, CEO of Ocean Infinity, said since the 2018 search, the company has been honing its robotics and sea-exploration technology, while working with analysts to narrow down search areas to \u201cone in which success becomes potentially achievable.\u201d \u201cWe hope to get back to the search soon,\u201d he said in a recent statement. But neither Ocean Infinity nor the Malaysian government have given more concrete details on their possible plans. Competing theories With little facts established, the disappearance of MH370 has puzzled the world and set off all kinds of theories over the years, from mechanical failure to accidental or deliberate pilot error and even some sort of hijacking. Where facts end and the mystery begins is around 40 minutes into the flight when the plane\u2019s transponder stopped transmitting. Its blips soon disappeared from civilian and military radar. Subsequent traces eventually led experts to conclude the aircraft had flown drastically off course. Instead of flying northeast across the South China Sea, analysts believed it turned back and glided south inexplicably over the Indian Ocean, one of the world\u2019s most remote locations in terms of flight monitoring due to the lack of imaging satellites, according to aviation experts. \u201cThis has all the hallmarks of a spy thriller, an espionage thriller. And it\u2019s captured the world\u2019s imagination,\u201d Geoffrey Thomas, editor-in-chief of AirlineRatings.com, said. \u201cEverybody can place themselves on a Boeing 777. Everybody can place themselves flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so real.\u201d An initial search, carried out by Malaysia, China, and Australia and estimated to have cost 200 million Australian dollars ($132 million), was called off in January 2017 after failing to find any trace. Ocean Infinity was then brought in by the Malaysian government on a no-find, no-fee basis. But its 90-day search in 2018 also failed to bear fruit. Richard Quest, CNN\u2019s Business editor-at-large and former Aviation Correspondent said despite years of search efforts, \u201cthe real truth is we are no closer to knowing exactly what caused the plane to go missing.\u201d \u201cThe hope is that new search techniques, new equipment, and better understanding of what happened to the plane will make this search successful,\u201d said Quest, author of\u00a0\u201cThe Vanishing of Flight MH370.\u201d Breakthrough in technology Aviation experts are confident about a breakthrough, if a new search is to be conducted. They pointed to a piece of technology called Weak Signal Propagation Reporter, or WSPR (pronounced whisper),\u00a0released in 2008. The technology has become popular among those looking for MH370 in recent years. Radio amateurs use it to track the strength of radio signals around the world and the data they collect catch anomalies caused by various types of interferences, which include a flight passing through, retired British Aerospace engineer Richard Godfrey explained to CNN. Godfrey said he traced WSPR data back to the time when MH370 disappeared and concluded the aircraft may be lying between 3,000 and 4,000 meters (9,800 to 13,000 feet) below the Indian Ocean, about 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) off the coast of Perth, Australia. As thorough as past searches might be, Godfrey said, they have not covered the location he suggested. \u201cI certainly believe MH370 can be found,\u201d he said, adding that his findings are in line with other hints, such as data provided by British satellite telecommunications company Inmarsat, which pointed to more or less the same area. But even if another expedition is granted, he said, preparation work could take months. AirlineRatings\u2019s Thomas has \u201ca strong feeling\u201d Godfrey is right but raises another anxiety. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that they\u2019re just giving the relatives some warm, comfortable statements on the anniversary,\u201d he said, of the Malaysian authorities. Reality hits Some relatives, like American Sarah Bajc, who lost her partner Phil Wood, have tried to move on. But she still feels like she is living in the shadow of the past from time to time. Since the flight\u2019s disappearance, Bajc has moved from Asia to Panama, where she remarried and opened an eco-resort that allows her and her husband to live off grid in the rainforest. But to this day, she avoids watching dramas and documentaries about plane crashes and has recurring nightmares. \u201cI would have nightmares of diving in this beautiful area with lots of fish. And then all of a sudden, the plane hull would be there, and the bodies would be floating,\u201d she said. On the prospect of a new search, she is sanguine. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re ready to do that, in which case I\u2019m very happy because \u2026 the families need closure, the world needs closure, and somebody needs to be held accountable,\u201d she said, of the prospect of another search being launched by Malaysia. Others, like Jiang, are determined to get to the bottom of the truth. He says not a day goes by when he doesn\u2019t think of his mother, who he described as a strong and hardworking woman he idolized as an inspirational figure. \u201cI can find her shadow in me. Whatever I am doing now is what my mother wants me to do,\u201d he said. Jiang is among the 40 families who launched another bid back home last year to seek justice through the Chinese legal system. Those on board came from a multitude of nationalities but China was hit by far the hardest with 153 passengers. The claimants in China are suing Malaysia Airlines, its insurer, Boeing and the manufacturer of the plane\u2019s engine, demanding compensation, a formal apology, and the resumption of psychological assistance to family members, as well as the creation of a fund to continue searches for the plane. It\u2019s unclear, however, how much jurisdiction Chinese courts will have over the list of companies with headquarters overseas. Having spent the past few days meeting Malaysian officials, Jiang is optimistic about a new search. But it also gives him mixed feelings. \u201cOn one hand, I really want to find the plane today or tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am also afraid of the reality I must face after finding the plane.\u201d",

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Nvidia isn\u2019t the only stock capturing the attention of AI enthusiasts these days. Nvidia is undoubtedly the poster child for artificial intelligence. Shares of the American chipmaker have soared roughly 277% over the last 12 months, helping drive a powerful bull market that\u2019s led stocks to record highs. Nvidia closed above a $2 trillion market cap on March 1, joining an elite cohort including Apple and Microsoft. But there\u2019s another AI-related stock that has quietly logged eye-popping gains. Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) have surged about 296% so far in 2024, following a 246% jump in 2023. Supermicro\u2019s stock gained even more momentum in January, after the company reported second-quarter results that blew past expectations and raised its full-year revenue forecast. Supermicro\u2019s stock was one of the most popular names bought by Charles Schwab clients in February, according to the firm\u2019s latest trading activity index. The server producer counts Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices among its customers. Its stock had risen at a breakneck pace even before last year\u2019s bull market. The shares jumped roughly 87% in 2022, while other tech names and the broader market got pummeled as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates aggressively to bring down wayward inflation. Supermicro\u2019s runaway gains are indicative of the burgeoning demand for high-quality infrastructure to support AI chips, after the creation of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in November 2022 kickstarted a race among tech behemoths to develop generative AI platforms and tools. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom. The chipmaker, which produces processors that power AI systems, reported last month that its full-year profits grew more than 580% from the prior year. \u201cEveryone\u2019s looking for something that looks and smells and tastes like Nvidia. \u2026 [Supermicro] is exactly that,\u201d said Victoria Bills, chief investment strategist at Banrion Capital Management. Supermicro has a market cap of roughly $63 billion, up from $5 billion just a year ago. The stock is set to join the benchmark S&P 500 index at its next quarterly rebalance. Wall Street thinks it has more room to run. Bank of America analysts initiated coverage on Supermicro last month with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating and price objective of $1,040, which the stock has already surpassed, closing at $1,124.70 a share on Wednesday. Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs analysts also recently initiated coverage. \u201cThe company\u2019s willingness to experiment with different combination of components, its close proximity to leading semiconductor companies in San Jose and the fact that a majority of its manufacturing is in the United States is a competitive advantage,\u201d wrote BofA analysts in a February 15 report. New York Community Bank gets $1 billion \u2018lifeline\u2019 Beleaguered regional lender New York Community Bank is receiving a more than $1 billion equity investment, reports my colleague Elisabeth Buchwald. The majority of the investment, $450 million, is coming from former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s firm, Liberty Strategic Capital. The remaining sum will come from Hudson Bay Capital, Reverence Capital Partners, Citadel Global Equities and \u201cother institutional investors and certain members of the Company\u2019s management,\u201d according to an announcement NYCB made Wednesday afternoon. The bank\u2019s stock plunged more than 40% earlier on Wednesday after The Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0that the bank was seeking a major cash infusion. After the deal was announced, the stock shot up 31% but those gains quickly leveled off. Ultimately, shares of NYCB closed 7% higher for the day after trades settled. The money \u201cprovides a lifeline,\u201d David Chiaverini, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, told CNN. In addition to the investment, NYCB announced Joseph Otting, a former comptroller of the currency, will replace Alessandro DiNello as CEO. DiNello, who was named CEO less than a week ago, will now become non-executive chairman. Read more here. Cash-strapped Britain cuts taxes for workers as election looms UK finance minister\u00a0Jeremy Hunt announced\u00a0a tax cut for workers Wednesday as he unveiled what is likely to be the government\u2019s last budget before a general election later this year, reports my colleague Hanna Ziady. Hunt cut\u00a0national insurance \u2014 a levy paid by people who work\u00a0\u2014 by two percentage points. That means an additional \u00a3450 ($572) a year for the average employee or \u00a3350 for someone who is self-employed. It\u2019s the second such cut in a matter of months. \u201cIf we want to encourage hard work, we should let people keep as much of their own money as possible,\u201d Hunt said. But soaring UK government debt, crumbling public services and a lackluster economy left\u00a0the chancellor with very little room for further substantial giveaways. The economy barely grew in 2023,\u00a0slipping into recession\u00a0at the end of the year in stark contrast with\u00a0Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s pledge to generate growth. In 2024, the Bank of England sees output expanding just 0.25%, while the International Monetary Fund has forecast growth of 0.6%. Hunt\u2019s Conservative Party is trailing the opposition Labour Party by a wide margin\u00a0in opinion polls, which had put\u00a0him under enormous pressure to unveil tax cuts \u2014 however small \u2014 in a last-ditch bid to win voters.

            "text": "Boeing has not turned over important records to investigators probing the door plug blowout on a 737 Max earlier this year, investigators say. That, Boeing signaled Wednesday afternoon, is because there are no records. The records in question are documentation of steps on the assembly line last fall when National Transportation Safety Board investigators believe\u00a0Boeing employees removed critical bolts that hold the plug in place, but did not reinstall the bolts before the plane left the Boeing factory in October 2023.\u00a0The plane flew about 150 commercial flights before the door plug flew off the plane mid-flight on January 5, just over two months ago. \u201cBoeing has not provided us with the documents and information that we have requested numerous times over the past few months, specifically with respect to opening, closing and removal of the door and the team that does that work at the Renton facility,\u201d National Transportation Safety Board chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said Wednesday in testimony before the US Senate Commerce Committee. She testified that because of Boeing\u2019s actions, NTSB investigators do not know who on the Boeing assembly line removed and reinstalled the door plug that \u2014 months later while the plane was in service carrying passengers \u2014 blew out. After her testimony, Boeing followed up with a statement:\u00a0\u201cWith respect to documentation, if the door plug removal was undocumented there would be no documentation to share. We will continue to cooperate fully and transparently with the NTSB\u2019s investigation.\u201d The Federal Aviation Administration has recently identified issues with processes on Boeing\u2019s manufacturing line. Earlier this week, it said a six-week audit of the company identified \u201cnon-compliance issues in Boeing\u2019s manufacturing process control, parts handling and storage, and product control,\u201d although it did not specify the specific shortcomings. NTSB investigators have made multiple visits to Boeing facilities and created a special team to handle requesting and processing documents from Boeing and its key contractor, Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing said it has \u201cworked proactively and transparently to fully support the NTSB\u2019s investigation.\u201d \u201cOur team works tirelessly with the NTSB team to respond comprehensively to all NTSB information requests and bring information to them that would be relevant to their investigation,\u201d Boeing said. In particular, Homendy said, investigators are keen on identifying the actual Boeing employees who had their hands on the door plug bolts. \u201cThere is one team \u2013 one team \u2013\u00a0that deals with the doors,\u201d Homendy said.\u00a0The team includes 25 employees and a manager, and she called it \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201creally disappointing\u201d that NTSB still did not have names. Following her testimony, Boeing signaled that it was providing the requested list of names. \u201cEarly in the investigation, we provided the NTSB with names of Boeing employees, including door specialists, who we believed would have relevant information,\u201d Boeing said. \u201cWe have now provided the full list of individuals on the 737 door team, in response to a recent request.\u201d A source familiar with the request said the specific ask for those names was submitted to Boeing over the last weekend. Homendy also raised concerns with Spirit\u2019s approach to the probe, saying three individuals Spirit presented to the NTSB for interviews actually did not work for the company, and instead worked for a subcontractor.\u00a0Spirit has not commented on Homendy\u2019s comments. Homendy said the FAA has been \u201cvery cooperative\u201d with the NTSB probe.",

            "text": "The Federal Aviation Administration has found multiple problems with Boeing\u2019s production practices following a six-week audit of Boeing triggered by the January 5 door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines\u2019 737 Max 9. \u201cThe FAA identified non-compliance issues in Boeing\u2019s manufacturing process control, parts handling and storage, and product control,\u201d the FAA said in a press release, but did not immediately provide further details. A separate report launched prior to the door plug incident but released last month found \u201cgaps\u201d in Boeing\u2019s safety culture, including a disconnect between management and employees, and fears among employees about retaliation for reporting safety concerns. The FAA said the findings of both this audit and the separate report should be part of Boeing\u2019s quality improvement plan. It has given Boeing 90 days to produce the plan to fix its quality issues. Boeing said it is prepared to do what is needed to improve quality. \u201cWe have a clear picture of what needs to be done. Transparency prevailed in all of these discussions,\u201d said the company\u2019s statement. \u201cBoeing will develop the comprehensive action plan with measurable criteria that demonstrates the profound change that Administrator [Michael] Whitaker and the FAA demand. Our Boeing leadership team is totally committed to meeting this challenge.\u201d It is not the first such promise from Boeing since the Alaska Air incident. In January Boeing CEO David Calhoun conceded Boeing needed to improve its quality controls. \u201cWhatever final conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened,\u201d said Calhoun in comments to the company\u2019s investors in January. \u201cAn event like this must not happen on an airplane that leaves our factory. We simply must do better for our customers and their passengers.\u201d The audit also included major Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which builds the fuselages for the Boeing 737 Max 9 jet, among other items. Without giving details, the FAA said it found multiple instances where both companies allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements. Boeing used to own the operations that now make up most of Spirit, but spun it off as a separate company in 2005. Boeing disclosed on Friday that it is in negotiations to possibly re-acquire Spirit. Asked for a comment on the report, a Spirit spokesman replied, \u201cWe are in communication with Boeing and the FAA on appropriate corrective actions.\u201d More than two dozen FAA inspectors are taking part in the audit of Boeing\u2019s 737 plant in Renton, Washington, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker told members of Congress during a hearing last month. The agency is not the only government body looking into Boeing\u2019s quality issues. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident aboard the Alaska Air flight. A preliminary report on the incident found that the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place were missing when the jet left Boeing\u2019s factory last October to be delivered to Alaska Air. The NTSB has yet to assign blame for the missing bolts. In addition, the Justice Department is reviewing whether deficiencies found in the wake of the\u00a0door plug blowout\u00a0on a 737 Max flight last month violate a\u00a0deferred prosecution agreement\u00a0that Boeing signed with the government three years ago following two Max\u00a0fatal crashes,\u00a0according to a person familiar with the investigation. That probe could expose Boeing to criminal liability. The final results of this audit will likely be the backbone of future congressional hearings that could take Boeing to task. This Wednesday, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy will give the latest on the Alaska Flight 1282 investigation to the Senate committee that oversees aviation. The chair of the Senate Commerce Committee has said that hearings involving Boeing executives will take place after senators hear the latest investigative findings.

            "title": "JetBlue pulls out of deal to buy Spirit Airlines",
            "text": "JetBlue Airways announced Monday it is pulling out of its deal to purchase Spirit Airlines. The decision comes in the wake of a federal court ruling blocking the deal from taking place on antitrust grounds. The Justice Department had argued that airfares could go up if Spirit was no longer an independent airline. Spirit has been a leader in the segment of the airline industry that offers very low, no-frills base fares that required passengers to pay extra for everything, including carry-on baggage. JetBlue agreed to pay Spirit $69 million as part of its decision to end the deal, JetBlue said. While the companies had appealed the judge\u2019s ruling blocking the deal, JetBlue and Spirit both issued statements saying it had become clear they wouldn\u2019t be able to overcome the legal obstacles to complete the merger. \u201cGiven the hurdles to closing that remain, we decided together that both airlines\u2019 interests are better served by moving forward independently,\u201d said JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty. Spirit said it was always prepared to continue as an independent airline, given the regulatory challenges the deal faced. \u201cWe are disappointed we cannot move forward with a deal,\u201d Spirit CEO Ted Christie said. \u201cHowever, we remain confident in our future as a successful independent airline.\u201d The decision could spark a new bidding war for Spirit. There is even the possibility that it could lead to a bankruptcy filing and liquidation for Spirit, according to at least one airline analyst. Spirit has struggled with losses for several years as larger airlines have returned to profitability since demand for flying resumed after the height of the pandemic. JetBlue had signaled it might pull out of the deal in a January filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, shortly after the judge\u2019s decision. It has been clear for months that Spirit is no long worth the $3.8 billion, or $33.50 a share, that JetBlue agreed to pay for the airline. Even before federal Judge William Young issued the ruling blocking the deal, a decision that sent the price of Spirit shares plunging, its shares were trading at half the purchase price, or less, over course of the last six months, and only two-thirds of the price at the time the deal was agreed upon in July 2022. Shares of Spirit closed Friday at $6.46 a share, giving it a market cap of just over $700 million. Its shares are down 75% from the closing price the day the deal was originally announced, and they fell another 10% in premarket trading Monday on the news. Meanwhile shares of JetBlue rose 3% in premarket trading on news that the deal was off. Airline analysts from JPMorgan Chase believe that while JetBlue might still interested in expanding, it likely wanted to walk away from the $3.8 billion deal as originally crafted even before the judge\u2019s decision. \u201cWe believe JetBlue was wholly unprepared (or unwilling) to proceed with the originally-crafted deal economics (the price was simply just too much to pay),\u201d the JPMorgan analysts wrote in that note the day of the court decision. That section of the note had the headline \u201cJetBlue dodges a bullet.\u201d What Spirit means for fares on other airlines The US airline industry has gone through more than 20 years of mergers and consolidation before this deal was announced. The 10 major airlines that existed in 1999 have been combined into four major carriers \u2014 American Airlines, United, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines \u2014 through a series of deals, often done as part of a bankruptcy proceeding. Those four large carriers carry about 80% of the nation\u2019s air traffic. The mergers have resulted in a much more profitable US airline industry, but far fewer choices for US air travelers, which can result in higher fares. The Biden administration has taken a much more aggressive approach in fighting mergers and combinations, including in the airline industry. Besides successfully fighting this deal in court, it also objected to an alliance between JetBlue and American Airlines, an alliance that was dropped as JetBlue pursued this deal. Since the rise of Spirit, the four biggest US airlines \u2013 American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Airlines and United Airlines \u2013 have since created a class of seats on their planes that more closely mirrored Spirit\u2019s frill-free offering, a \u201cbasic economy\u201d seat. But they were also making a significant portion of their money by selling seats with a more premium service, including first class, business class, and economy-plus seats. But while its customers might have liked its fares, Spirit was regularly at or near the top in customer complaints about the service, according to Transportation Department reports. And with its fare structure and other issues, Spirit has found it difficult to return to profitability the way the larger carriers have. And if analysts who doubt Spirit\u2019s ability to survive prove to be correct, the end of this deal could lead to a closure of the airline and the loss of 13,000 jobs at Spirit, along with the higher fares that it sought to avoid by blocking the deal. Spirit reported an adjusted loss of $359.5 million in 2023, nearly double the $189.4 million it lost in 2022. Analysts forecast it will lose nearly $300 million more this year and $174 million in 2025. JetBlue has also been mired in losses since the pandemic as well, reporting an adjusted loss of $151 million in 2023, although that was an improvement from the $260 million it lost in 2022. Still, it faces its own challenges going forward, including activist investor Carl Icahn buying a 10% stake in the company and announcing plans to win two seats on its board of directors for his allies at the upcoming shareholders\u2019 meeting.

            "text": " Ed Pierson was flying from Seattle to New Jersey in 2023, when he ended up boarding a plane he\u2019d never wanted to fly on. The Seattle resident booked with Alaska Airlines last March, purposefully selecting a flight with a plane he was happy to board \u2013 essentially, anything but a Boeing 737 Max. \u201cI got to the airport, checked again that it wasn\u2019t the Max. I went through security, got coffee. I walked onto the plane \u2013 I thought, it\u2019s kinda new,\u201d Pierson told CNN. \u201cThen I sat down and on the emergency card [in the seat pocket] it said it was a Max.\u201d He got up and walked off. \u201cA flight attendant was closing the front door. I said, \u2018I wasn\u2019t supposed to fly the Max.\u2019 She was like, \u2018What do you know about the Max?,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018I can\u2019t go into detail right now, but I wasn\u2019t planning on flying the Max, and I want to get off the plane.\u2019\u201d Pierson made it to New Jersey \u2013 after some back and forth, he said, Alaska\u2019s airport staff rebooked him onto a red-eye that evening on a different plane. Spending the whole day in the airport was worth it to avoid flying on the Max, he said. Pierson has a unique and first-hand perspective of the aircraft, made by Boeing at its Renton factory in the state of Washington. Now the executive director of airline watchdog group Foundation for Aviation Safety, he served as a squadron commanding officer among other leadership roles during a 30-year Naval career, followed by 10 years at Boeing \u2013 including three as a senior manager in production support at Renton itself, working on the 737 Max project before its launch. But he\u2019s one of a number of travelers who do not want to board the aircraft which has been at the heart of two fatal crashes, as well as the January 5 incident in which part of the fuselage of an Alaska Airlines plane blew out mid-air. The part \u2013 a door plug \u2013 was found to be missing four bolts that should have held it in place. Further reports of \u201cmany\u201d loose bolts and misdrilled holes have emerged from the subsequent investigations into the Max 9 model after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered the grounding of 171 Max 9 aircraft with the same door plug. Experts agree that the Alaska incident could have been worse, and the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has warned that \u201csomething like this can happen again.\u201d The previous model, the Max 8, was involved in two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed a total of 346 people. The crashes were widely attributed to the malfunctioning of MCAS, an automated system in the Max designed to stabilize the pitch of the plane, overriding pilot input in some circumstances. Boeing accepted its liability\u00a0in 2021 for one of the crashes. Weeks after the Alaska incident, Boeing CEO David Calhoun told investors on a quarterly call: \u201cWe will cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA at every turn\u2026 This increased scrutiny, whether it comes from us or a regulator or from third parties will make us better.\u201d \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cWhatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better.\u201d In February, in the wake of the Alaska incident, the company removed the head of the Max program\u00a0from his position and reshuffled other senior management figures. The move comes as critics have repeatedly said that the aircraft manufacturer is prioritizing profits over safety. The FAA is now \u201ctaking a holistic look at the quality control issues at Boeing to ensure safety is always the company\u2019s top priority,\u201d a spokesperson for the government agency told CNN. Representatives are on the ground assessing the production lines at Boeing\u2019s Renton factory and Spirit AeroSystems, whose Wichita, Kansas factory made the door plug that blew off mid-flight in the Alaska incident. On February 28, the FAA gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to address quality and safety issues. Boeing told CNN: \u201cEvery day, more than 80 airlines operate about 5,000 flights with the global fleet of 1,300 737 MAX airplanes, carrying 700,000 passengers to their destinations safely.\u00a0The 737 MAX family\u2019s in-service reliability is above 99% and consistent with other commercial airplane models.\u201d Of course, many thousands of people board Max aircraft with no concerns. But do other passengers care? It appears that enough do. Mixed impressions The last time the Max was grounded \u2013 for 20 months, following the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 on a Max 8 in March 2019 \u2013 25% of the 1,005 Americans questioned in a Reuters/Ipsos poll\u00a0said that they had \u201cnot a lot\u201d or \u201cno\u201d confidence in the aircraft \u2013 compared to 31% who did, and 44% who were unsure. The poll was taken in December 2020, shortly before the aircraft\u2019s return to the skies. After being \u201ctold about the aircraft\u2019s safety issues,\u201d a further 57% said they would be somewhat unlikely or not likely to fly in a Max, according to the report. Nearly half \u2013 45% \u2013 said that they would still be somewhat unlikely or not very likely to fly in it after it had been back in the air for six months. And 31% of all respondents said that they had little to no confidence that the Federation Aviation Administration (FAA) \u201cputs passenger and crew safety first when determining whether an aircraft is fit to fly.\u201d Most countries cleared the Max 8 to fly again by 2021, but three years on, there still appears to be negative public opinion about the Max. \u201cIt\u2019s unsettling that there have been so many issues with this specific type of plane,\u201d Stephanie King, a passenger on the affected Alaska Airlines flight, told CNN in January. \u201cI hope something is done so that this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Then there\u2019s flight booking site Kayak, which has seen usage of its filter to deselect Max aircraft (models 8 and 9) during the booking process increase 15-fold since January, the company told CNN. The site introduced the filter in March 2019, after the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Doubts have also remained across the industry as a whole. Following the Alaska incident, a February AP-Norc poll\u00a0regarding air travel safety found nearly a third of Americans surveyed answered \u201cnot at all\u201d or \u201ca little\u201d when asked if they believe that airplanes are safe from structural faults. While planes were generally viewed to be as safe as cars or trains for means of transportation, fewer than two in 10 surveyed strongly agreed that planes are fault-free. If it\u2019s Boeing, \u2018I ain\u2019t going\u2019 Bel\u00e9n Estacio has boycotted the Max since the January incident. Shortly after the Alaska Airlines fuselage blowout, she was scheduled on a Max for a work flight. \u201cMy boyfriend didn\u2019t want me to fly on it so I changed my travel plans to make sure I wasn\u2019t flying on any type of Max,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter which model, I don\u2019t want to fly them.\u201d To her, she said, \u201cThe Alaska incident was further confirmation that Boeing is still not being thorough and not fixing its issues.\u201d Florida-based Estacio, who works in marketing, now checks the aircraft type before booking any flight. She\u2019s made two trips since January. \u201cThe whole thing of, \u2018If it\u2019s not Boeing I ain\u2019t going,\u2019 it\u2019s totally the opposite now,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very happy when I\u2019ve seen I\u2019ll be flying an Airbus.\u201d She says she\u2019s not the only one in her circle, and says she knows people employing both \u201csoft\u201d and \u201chard\u201d boycotts. \u201cSome say, \u2018Absolutely not,\u2019 others say, \u2018If I can change it, I will; if not I\u2019ll just go on it.\u2019\u201d \u2018Not an aircraft I\u2019d want to fly\u2019 UK-based communications consultant Elayne Grimes is another with a personal boycott. Grimes, who travels regularly for work, was worried following the Max 8\u2019s first crash\u00a0in October 2018: Lion Air flight 610, in Indonesia, which killed all 189 onboard a plane in service for less than three months. Grimes \u2013 who\u2019d previously worked in emergency crisis management \u2013 was immediately concerned about Boeing\u2019s new aircraft, which had launched to great fanfare in 2017. \u201cI actively sought out airlines that didn\u2019t have the Max,\u201d she said. When Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed in March 2019, killing another 157 people, it confirmed her resolve. In 2022, Grimes watched \u201cDownfall: The Case Against Boeing,\u201d a Netflix documentary directed by Rory Kennedy, which looked at the two tragedies and flagged concerns about the working environment at Boeing. \u201cI watched that and thought [Boeing] was an organization putting profit before people, and thought, \u2018That\u2019s not for me.\u2019 I don\u2019t see myself flying one in the near future,\u201d she said. While the FAA has cleared the Max to fly once more, Grimes believes that \u201cits issues are not resolved.\u201d \u201cWhen the door came off and they called [the planes] in and found other aircraft with issues, I thought \u2018Hmm,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not an aircraft I\u2019d want to fly.\u201d Grimes is a self-declared \u201cavgeek,\u201d or aviation fanatic \u2013 and she\u2019s not the only one monitoring the industry closely to have reservations. Elliot Sharod, who says he took 78 flights last year, is on the fence. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t exactly refuse to fly it, but I\u2019d ideally fly an Airbus if given the choice,\u201d he said. A former aviation journalist, who wished to remain anonymous for professional reasons, says they lost trust after the second crash. \u201cAfter the first one, the predominant talking points were, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s got to be pilot error, or the weather \u2013 it can\u2019t be the plane,\u201d they say. \u201cIt was Boeing. I believed that everything coming out of Boeing had been tested and retested \u2013 it had to be something else. \u201cThen the Ethiopian crash happened, and there was a bit of the same messaging, but finally it came out that actually it was\u00a0the plane. I lost all trust at that point in the Max.\u201d They say they still love flying the \u201colder style of Boeings \u2013 the 777s and the original 737s.\u201d \u201cThey were all designed back in the days when engineers ruled Boeing,\u201d they say. \u201cI feel I can trust them more than the Max.\u201d \u2018Piss poor design\u2019 \u201cWould you put your family on a Max simulator trained aircraft? I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d They sound like the words of an anxious passenger in 2024. In fact, they were written by one Boeing employee to another in February 2018 \u2013 eight months before the Lion Air crash. (In the internal communications, their co-worker replied, simply, \u201cNo.\u201d) In April 2017, in internal messages by Boeing employees working on the soon-to-be-released Max, another employee wrote, \u201cThis airplane is designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.\u201d The same exchange included a reference to the aircraft\u2019s \u201cpiss poor design.\u201d A design tweak was labelled as \u201cpatching the leaky boat.\u201d These internal communications\u00a0were released as part of the 18-month investigation into the Max by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In a 238-page report, released in September 2020, the committee outlined\u00a0\u201cthe serious flaws and missteps in the design, development, and certification of the aircraft.\u201d The report highlighted five key themes, including \u201cproduction pressures that jeopardized the safety of the flying public\u201d and a \u201cculture of concealment\u201d at Boeing. At the time, Boeing said that the communications \u201cdo not reflect the company we are and need to be, and they are completely unacceptable.\u201d The company issued a statement\u00a0acknowledging the committee\u2019s findings and saying that the victims of the crashes were \u201cin our thoughts and prayers.\u201d Boeing said that when the Max 8 returned to service it would be \u201cone of the most thoroughly scrutinized aircraft in history, and we have full confidence in its safety.\u201d It added: \u201cWe have been hard at work strengthening our safety culture and rebuilding trust with our customers, regulators, and the flying public\u2026 We have made fundamental changes to our company\u2026 and continue to look for ways to improve.\u201d The House Committee report also included concerns about the FAA and its \u201cgrossly insufficient oversight\u201d over Boeing during the Max design process and in the period between the two crashes. The report\u00a0said that \u201cgaps in the regulatory system at the FAA\u2026 allowed this fatally flawed plane into service.\u201d A spokesperson for the FAA told CNN: \u201cThe FAA made significant improvements to its delegation and aircraft certification processes in recent years and took immediate action following the Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines door plug incident to address concerns about the quality of aircraft that Boeing\u00a0and its suppliers produce.\u201d \u2018Vindicated\u2019 after safety failure Rory Kennedy followed the investigation from start to finish. The director of \u201cDownfall\u201d told CNN she didn\u2019t have a \u201cstrong opinion\u201d on the plane until she started making the documentary in early 2020. But, she said, \u201cI was shocked by what we discovered\u2026 [it] was really disturbing.\u201d Her film is a forensic investigation of the two crashes. \u201cDownfall\u201d interviews ex-Boeing staff and concerned pilots, who paint a picture of an accident waiting to happen. It follows the congressional hearings held as part of the House investigation, and interviews the victims\u2019 families. Kennedy says that during the design process Boeing \u201cwent to great pains to hide [MCAS] and how powerful it was.\u201d The stabilizing system was designed specifically for the Max, since the fuel-efficient engines being added to the 1960s-designed plane affected the trim. The House committee found that Boeing concealed its existence from the FAA, airlines and pilots. Additionally, after the Lion Air crash, FAA analysis in December 2018 predicted that without a software fix, a Max could crash on average once every two years\u00a0over the course of its usage. Yet the plane was not grounded at the time. \u201cBoeing and FAA both gambled with public safety,\u201d\u00a0House committee chair Peter DeFazio said in a 2020 statement. \u201cWe are already undertaking important initiatives based on what we have learned\u2026 these initiatives are focused on advancing overall aviation safety by improving our organization, process and culture,\u201d the FAA said in a statement\u00a0following the committee\u2019s report. \u201c[They] decided to keep the plane in the air, to save money and try to have a fix before the next plane crashed,\u201d said Kennedy. \u201cI interviewed [family members of the victims] as they were understanding that they knew this. Can you imagine?\u201d \u201cI would absolutely not fly that plane,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI\u2019ve not noticed the culture of Boeing has shifted from one that prioritizes finances over safety.\u201d She says that one of the factors that pushed her to make the documentary, was \u201ctalking to pilots who were telling me, \u2018Absolutely don\u2019t get on that plane.\u2019\u201d And while she initially received pushback about the film, including from family and friends, \u201cWhen the door ripped off the airplane, people said, \u2018You\u2019re so vindicated.\u2019\u201d Her research also highlighted production issues in the 787 Dreamliner \u2013 Boeing\u2019s flagship long-haul aircraft, which debuted in 2011. As a result, she avoids that, too \u2013 and suggests that instead of confining their investigations to individual planes, the FAA and NTSB should be investigating Boeing as a whole. A spokesperson for the FAA said that it has blocked production expansion of the Max, and \u201cis conducting enhanced oversight of Boeing and its suppliers. The agency is examining all aspects of Boeing\u2019s three manufacturing lines and Spirit AeroSystems\u2019 supplier activities. A dedicated team of approximately two dozen aviation safety inspectors is conducting these reviews at the Boeing 737 MAX facility in Renton, Washington, and at Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas.\u201d Kennedy wants a \u201cproper hearing\u201d in Congress \u2013 similar to the one that investigated the Max crashes. \u201cTo me, what you really need is an investigation into the culture of Boeing, what\u2019s happening at board level, and what kind of decisions are being made to continue to prioritize financial interests over the safety of consumers,\u201d she says. \u2018Their numbers game cost me my friend\u2019 Critics say that Boeing\u2019s 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas saw the culture change\u00a0from one that emphasized engineering prowess to one intent on watching the bottom line. Damning its \u201cbroken safety culture,\u201d DeFazio said after the 2020 investigation that \u201cBoeing \u2013 under pressure to compete with Airbus and deliver profits for Wall Street \u2013 escaped scrutiny from the FAA, withheld critical information from pilots, and ultimately put planes into service that killed 346 innocent people.\u201d In 2021, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle criminal charges that the company defrauded the FAA when the Max was first certified. \u201cThe reason that [Boeing\u2019s] culture is so damaging is because they are in a numbers game, and they want to make as much profit as possible at any cost. And for me, that cost me my friend,\u201d says Deveney Williams. In March 2019, Williams\u2019 friend, Samya Stumo, was onboard the Ethiopian Airlines flight. The pair had been due to move into an apartment together in Washington, D.C. \u201cI avoid Boeing as much as possible \u2013 I try to get on an Airbus even if it costs more or is a different route,\u201d said Williams. \u201cI never knew about plane models prior to this, but I\u2019ve educated myself onto how to see the model when buying a ticket. I\u2019ve got friends who ask how they can switch flights, or figure out how to avoid flying on this. I\u2019ve learned a lot \u2013 I don\u2019t want this happening to anyone else.\u201d For Williams, the Alaska incident was a \u201cweird relief\u201d \u2013 because it happened in the US. The aspersions that were cast on the pilots of the two crashes didn\u2019t happen in January. \u201cThis time, it\u2019s on American soil, I\u2019m presuming it was an American pilot \u2013 so they don\u2019t have any other fingers to point.\u201d \u2018Airlines don\u2019t make it easy to switch\u2019 Torleif Stumo \u2013 Samya\u2019s brother \u2013 had a similar incident to Ed Pierson, in which he says his plane was switched to a Max at the last moment. Like Pierson, he only noticed when he saw the safety card in the seat pocket of his flight from Panama City to Bogot\u00e1 in August 2023. \u201cI don\u2019t really have anxiety, I\u2019ve never had panic attacks but that was one of the closest times I ever came,\u201d he says. \u201cThe crew were amazing. They had disconnected from the jetway and initially offered to change my seat to first class. But then I told them why I wanted to get off. They immediately understood and brought the plane back [to the gate].\u201d Stumo ended up spending the night at an airport hotel. The airline he was traveling with agreed to rebook him fee-free having listened to a phone call he\u2019d made to customer services when originally buying the ticket. In it, he\u2019d been assured that he wouldn\u2019t be on a Max. Williams and Kennedy both say they\u2019ve had similar experiences with their aircraft switched to a Max at the last minute. Stumo believes that it\u2019s not easy enough for consumers to tell whether they\u2019ve been booked onto a Max. Michael Stumo, Samya and Torleif\u2019s father, wants aircraft types to be \u201cprominently displayed\u201d during the booking process, he tells CNN. Following the January 5 incident, Alaska and United \u2013 the US carriers which use the Max 9 \u2013 issued waivers allowing passengers unwilling to fly the Max flexibility. These have now expired, but Alaska told CNN that concerned passengers can be rebooked onto a different aircraft for free, by calling reservations. \u201cWe have complete confidence in the safety of all our aircraft,\u201d they added. A spokesperson for United said the airline \u201chas no change fees on most tickets. We\u2019re happy to work with customers with concerns to find a solution that works for them.\u201d Pierson\u2019s Foundation for Aviation Safety \u2013 established in 2023 as a watchdog for both the aviation industry and the government entities that regulate it \u2013 added a page to their website in February\u00a0for passengers reluctant to fly on the plane. It explains how to check the plane assigned for one\u2019s flight before booking, refusing to board, and rebooking at the airport. Pierson says the foundation gets many requests from the public asking whether it\u2019s safe to fly the Max. The former Boeing employee has been critical of Boeing company since the aircraft was first on the production line. Over the summer of 2018, he sent several messages up the chain at Boeing, having noticed what he now says was an \u201cunstable production line.\u201d In emails which he has since shared publicly, Pierson warned of his concerns that the intense pressure to get planes out of the factory was leading exhausted workers to cut corners. He feared that it could end in tragedy, he wrote. Having taken early retirement in August 2018 \u2013 \u201cI knew it was an unhealthy working environment and couldn\u2019t support the leadership anymore,\u201d he told CNN \u2013 he wrote again to the board of Boeing, as well as to the FAA, after the Lion Air crash, and then again after the Ethiopian Airlines crash. He later testified at the congressional hearing. \u201cI would definitely not fly that plane,\u201d he says now. \u201cThe same problems that I saw in 2017 and 2018 have not been resolved. The factory is still putting huge amounts of pressure on employees that build the planes, and they\u2019ve had many production quality defects that just came to light.\u201d \u2018We want no third crash\u2019 Although the Max is flying once more, its future appears to be up in the air. The FAA has capped production of new aircraft, and launched an investigation \u201cinto whether Boeing failed to maintain their quality system in accordance with federal regulations.\u201d It has also launched an analysis of \u201cpotential safety-focused reforms around quality control,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. As part of its \u201cenhanced oversight,\u201d FAA teams are reviewing Boeing\u2019s Max production system, and Spirit AeroSystems\u2019 production system for the aircraft\u2019s fuselage. It is also reviewing employee training and qualifications, increasing its onsite presence at Max manufacturing facilities, and looking at \u201chow Boeing transfers unfinished work from suppliers to its production lines,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. Meanwhile, the NTSB\u2019s investigation into what happened on Alaska Airlines flight 1282 continues. A preliminary NTSB report does not lay blame on Boeing nor find a probable cause, which is typically included in the NTSB\u2019s final report which could take a year or more. Spirit said following the incident it was cooperating with the NTSB and added, \u201cas a company, we remain focused on the quality of each aircraft structure that leaves our facilities.\u201d For Michael Stumo, the Alaska incident proved his fears. \u201cWe have nine years of [Boeing] getting caught, promising to do better, and they don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have this: where they can\u2019t even put plug doors in a plane, can\u2019t fix bolts.\u201d Stumo wants Boeing to \u201cbring in people who know how to do complex manufacturing processes.\u201d \u201cThese people exist. Boeing has a lot of money. Hire them,\u201d he said. A Boeing spokesperson said the company has \u201cinvested heavily in our workforce over the last several years.\u201d Engineering staff are up by 10% and manufacturing by 11%, they said, while they have \u201cincreased the number of Commercial Airplanes quality inspectors by 20%, and have said we will continue to hire.\u201d \u201cWe have also invested in quality across the company, growing the number of quality employees by more than 25%, exceeding 2019 pre-pandemic levels,\u201d they added. Stumo says the company needs urgent change. \u201cThe first crash shouldn\u2019t have happened. The second they had full knowledge of [the MCAS malfunctioning] \u2013 it absolutely shouldn\u2019t have happened. \u201cWe want no third crash. And we want Boeing transformed back into the superior aviation engineering company making amazing and safe products that it was.\u201d",

            "text": "Boeing said it is in talks to buy Spirit AeroSystems, a major supplier that was part of Boeing until a 2005 sale and one that was also involved in an Alaska Airlines mid-air door plug blowout. Negotiations were first reported earlier Friday by the Wall Street Journal and Seattle Times. Spirit shares soared 15% in trading Friday on the reports. But shares had been down 10% from the time of the Alaska Air incident in early January through Thursday\u2019s close, and down 70% since a March 2019 fatal crash of a Boeing 737 Max , which led to a 20-month grounding of the jet. Boeing sold Spirit in 2005, receiving $900 million in cash for the sale. Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems makes major parts of several Boeing models, including the fuselages for the 737 Max. The parts are then shipped to Boeing\u2019s factory in Washington state via rail. \u201cWe believe that the reintegration of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems\u2019 manufacturing operations would further strengthen aviation safety, improve quality and serve the interests of our customers, employees, and shareholders,\u201d Boeing said in a statement late Friday. \u201dAlthough there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement, we are committed to finding ways to continue to improve the safety and quality of the airplanes on which millions of people depend each and every day.\u201d Spirit has had its own series of quality control issues in recent years. The problems had become serious enough that Boeing had agreed to give it more money to try to improve Spirit\u2019s quality and reliability issues there hurting Boeing\u2019s own output. The payments came to an extra $60 million in revenue last year and $395 million in 2024 and 2025. Those payments are an indication of Boeing\u2019s motivation for a deal for Spirit. It can\u2019t return to profitability itself unless problems at Spirit are also fixed. And it\u2019s going to cost Boeing money to fix those problems, whether it is the largest customer, or the owner, of those operations. About $3.9 billion of Spirit AeroSystems\u2019 revenue last year came from Boeing, making up about 64% of its overall revenue. Boeing rival Airbus is Spirit\u2019s second largest customer. It is unlikely that Boeing would be able hold onto that part of the business were it to reacquire Spirit. Spirit\u2019s market cap at the close of trading Friday, after shares had been lifted by the reports of a possible deal, stood at $3.7 billion, or just slightly less than what Boeing paid Spirit last year as its major supplier. But after five years of net losses totaling $31.5 billion, Boeing ended 2023 with only $12.7 billion on its balance sheet, down from $14.6 billion the year before. An initial report from the National Transportation Safety Board on the January incident with the door plug blowing out aboard the Alaska Air flight found that the jet had left Boeing\u2019s factory in October with four bolts missing that were needed to keep it in place. But the reason that the door plug, and the missing bolts, were removed by Boeing was that the fuselage arrived at Boeing\u2019s factory with problems with five rivets that had been done by Spirit AeroSystems. So even if Boeing was ultimately responsible for the problem, quality issues at Spirit may have also played a part. The NTSB has yet to assess blame for the incident. But the bolts have been just one of a series of quality issues at Spirit AeroSystems in recent years. Fuselages have been delivered to Boeing with work still needing to be done on them, which caused what is known as \u201cout-of-sequence\u201d work, which may have caused some of Boeing\u2019s own quality issues. In 2023 it used a \u201cnon-standard manufacturing process\u201d when joining parts of the fuselages, causing a halt in deliveries of 737 Max jets. And just a month ago, a Spirit employee notified Boeing that two holes may not have been drilled exactly to Boeing\u2019s requirements, which required Boeing to rework about 50 planes that had not yet been delivered. This story was updated with additional reporting and context.",

            "text": "The Federal Aviation Administration has flagged more safety issues for two troubled families of Boeing planes, the latest in a series of issues at the embattled aircraft maker. The issues involve engine anti-ice systems on the 737 Max and larger 787 Dreamliner. While the FAA flagged the issues in a filing in mid-February, it\u00a0drew greater attention on Friday because of a Seattle Times article. The safety regulator continues to allow both models of the plane to fly despite the potential problems. Both issues are moving through the FAA\u2019s standard process for developing airworthiness directives \u2014 rather than an emergency process \u2014 signaling that the agency and plane maker do not believe the issues are serious enough to require the planes to stop flying immediately. Boeing issued a statement saying neither issue is \u201can immediate safety-of-flight concern based on extensive engineering analysis.\u201d \u201cOur extensive efforts to further improve airplane safety include systematically reviewing issues,\u201d the company said. But another safety issue is the last thing that Boeing needs at this moment, two months after a door plug on a 737 Max blew out on an Alaska Air flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet shortly after take-off. The Max has had a series of problems over the last five years, including two fatal crashes that between them killed 346 people in late 2018 and early 2019, which led to a 20-month grounding of the jet. The importance of de-icing While it might seem as if de-icing equipment is less important in summer months, the cold temperatures at high altitudes at which commercial jets fly, combined with the amount of moisture in clouds that they must fly through, make the de-icing equipment necessary twelve months a year. \u201cYou\u2019re not protected by Mother Nature\u2019s seasons,\u201d said Dennis Tajer, an American Airlines pilot and a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association. \u201cAirworthiness directives aren\u2019t issued unless you have an unsafe condition that need to be addressed. It\u2019s ominous. It may be manageable on a temporary basis. But it\u2019s not a solution.\u201d The FAA said the newly disclosed Max issue could cause the jet\u2019s engines to stop working.\u00a0An electrical issue \u201ccould result in loss of thrust on both engines due to damage from operation in icing conditions.\u201d\u00a0The fix includes replacing wiring in a panel above the pilots\u2019 heads. The issue was discovered during a Boeing engineering analysis three years ago and is \u201ca remote concern that has never been seen during decades of service\u201d in both the current and previous generations of 737, said Jessica Kowal, a Boeing spokeswoman.\u00a0The company said it disclosed the issue to airlines and the FAA at the time, and provided a fix. The 2021 discovery lines up with the company\u2019s order that year to ground some Max planes because of a different electrical problem.\u00a0The Boeing Max \u2014 at the time, only recently back in service after the nearly two-year grounding prompted by two fatal crashes \u2014 underwent an extensive electrical system analysis. A different issue with the Dreamliner Less than a week after publicly publishing the 737 Max notice, the FAA reported a separate anti-icing issue with the 787 Dreamliner.\u00a0It said a damaged seal could cause heat damage to an engine inlet \u2014 and risk serious damage to the plane. In 2018, an outer covering of an engine cowling that broke loose on an earlier version of a 737 jet shattered a window on a Southwest Airlines flight. The passenger sitting next to that window, Jennifer Riordan, 43, was expelled through the broken window. While other passengers were able to bring her back inside, she died as a result of blunt impact trauma of the head, neck and torso. Boeing is working on redesigning the part on the 787 Dreamliner engine to prevent further issues, Kowal said.\u00a0The issue was discovered on fewer than two dozen of over 1,000 Dreamliners in service, she said. The FAA described neither issue as a production quality problem \u2014 which is its current focus at Boeing following the January in-flight blowout. The FAA orders have not yet taken effect, but said they would apply to about 315 planes, including both Maxes and Dreamliners. Series of safety and quality questions Boeing drew criticism from lawmakers after the January 737 Max mid-flight blowout for having asked the FAA to certify new models of the 737 Max despite a different flaw in the anti-ice system.\u00a0The company ultimately withdrew that request, which will delay its plans to deliver the new planes to its airline customers. But it continues to build existing models of the jet with the same engine de-icing flaw that is delaying certification of the next Max versions. In addition to the de-icing equipment issue, Boeing has been stung by numerous questions about the quality and safety procedures at its factories. The National Transportation Safety Board is looking into the causes of the incident and already found that four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place were\u00a0missing when the plane left a Boeing factory\u00a0in October. The FAA is also demanding that Boeing come up with a\u00a0plan to improve its quality controls\u00a0for its aircraft manufacturing. And the\u00a0Justice Department is investigating\u00a0whether the incident is a violation of a settlement it reached in 2021 to defer prosecution on charges that it\u00a0defrauded the FAA\u00a0during the\u00a0original certification\u00a0of the 737 Max before\u00a0two fatal crashes\u00a0resulted in a\u00a020-month grounding\u00a0of the plane. The NTSB has yet to determine blame or fault for the door plug incident on the Alaska Air flight. That will come later in its investigation, perhaps a year or more from now. But Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told investors in January, \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.\u201d",

            "text": "Boeing has agreed to pay $51 million for violating exports controls of military technology, including employees in China downloading sensitive data from numerous defense aircraft and missiles. The complaint charges that three Boeing employees in China downloaded data 25 times between 2013 and 2017 related to three different models of fighter jets, an airborne warning and control system, an attack helicopter and two varieties of air-to-ground missiles. In addition, Boeing disclosed that there were also 80 additional unauthorized downloads of defense data and information that was required to be protected by its employees and contractors in 18 countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Morocco, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, Taiwan, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. The State Department found a total of 199 violations of the Arms Export Control Act by Boeing. It said all of the alleged violations were voluntarily disclosed and a considerable majority predate 2020, after which Boeing \u201cincorporated numerous improvements to its compliance program.\u201d \u201cHad the Department not taken into consideration these mitigating factors, it would have charged Respondent with additional violations or proposed a higher penalty,\u201d said the statement from the agency to Boeing. The department said that $24 million of the fine will be suspended as long as that money is used to strengthen Boeing\u2019s compliance program further. The company will also be subject to the oversight of a special compliance officer for at least the next two years. \u201cWe are committed to our trade controls obligations, and we look forward to working with the State Department under the agreement announced today,\u201d said the statement from Boeing. \u201cWe are committed to continuous improvement of that program, and the compliance undertakings reflected in this agreement will help us advance that objective.\u201d Besides its commercial aircraft business, Boeing is a major defense contractor, with revenue of $24.9 billion last year. That compares to revenue of $33.9 billion from its commercial jet sales. This settlement is just the latest blow to Boeing\u2019s once-stellar reputation. It faces multiple investigations for a door plug blowing out on a 737 Max flight in January, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the Alaska Airlines flight. The National Safety Transportation Board is looking into the causes of the incident and already found that four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place were missing when the plane left a Boeing factory in October. The Federal Aviation Administration is also demanding that Boeing come up with a plan to improve its quality controls for its aircraft manufacturing. And the Justice Department is investigating whether the incident is a violation of a settlement it reached in 2021 to defer prosecution on charges that it defrauded the FAA during the original certification of the 737 Max before two fatal crashes that killed all 346 people aboard the flights resulted in a 20-month grounding of the plane. The NTSB has yet to determine blame or fault for the door plug incident on the Alaska Air flight. That will come later in its investigation, perhaps a year or more from now. But Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told investors in January, \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.\u201d",

Dell revenue declined 11% in the fourth quarter. Although that was better than forecast, Dell\u2019s PC business is lagging. Still, the Texas-based firm noted demand for powerful servers to run AI workloads surged in the last three months. Its infrastructure unit pulled in $9.3 billion in revenue, with its 10% growth from the previous quarter \u201cdriven primarily by AI-optimized servers\u201d (however, it is down 6% year-over-year). Dell Technologies shares, which reached a record high close to cap Thursday\u2019s trading session, rose almost 20% in after-hours trading. \u201cWe\u2019ve just started to touch the AI opportunities ahead of us, and we believe Dell is uniquely positioned with our broad portfolio to help customers build GenAI solutions that meet performance, cost and security requirements,\u201d Jeff Clarke, the company\u2019s chief operating officer,\u00a0said in a statement Thursday. Nvidia, the AI chip leader, has leapfrogged giants like Amazon to become one of the world\u2019s most valuable\u00a0companies. But demand for hardware to make AI a reality is higher than Nvidia is able to produce. That means there\u2019s an opportunity for companies like Dell to fill the gap. That\u2019s good news for Dell, because its primary business has struggled since the Covid-era PC boom. Consulting firm Gartner found that 2023 was the worst year for PCs in history, declining 14.8%. It was the second year in a row with a double-digit decline. Dell in particular declined almost 20%. However, PC shipments did increase in the fourth quarter of 2022, the first time it has increased after eight straight quarters of decline. \u201cPCs will become even more essential as most day-to-day work with AI will be done on the PC,\u201d Clarke said in prepared remarks for the company\u2019s earnings call Thursday.

            "text": "This year hasn\u2019t started well for aviation safety, with a runway collision at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport and a door plug blowing out mid-air from an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 in January, and with four more fatal accidents involving regional and business aircraft in the weeks since. However, commercial airplanes remain the safest form of travel and a new report released February 28 confirms that 2023 was, by several measures, the safest year ever for flying. Now in its 60th year, the IATA Annual Safety Report - compiled by the International Air Transport Association - has been tracking the evolution of commercial aviation safety since 1964. Its data recorded 37 million flights in 2023 (both jet and turboprop), an increase of 17% on the year before. But despite this, 2023 had the lowest fatality risk and \u201call accident\u201d rate on record. \u201cAt this level of safety, on average a person would have to travel by air every day for 103,239 years to experience a fatal accident,\u201d says the IATA report. There were no fatal accidents or hull losses involving passenger jet aircraft last year, but the tragedy of Yeti Airlines Flight 691, a turboprop plane that crashed in Nepal in January with the loss of 72 lives, confirms that we can never take safety for granted. The industry must always strive to improve. \u201cThis is what we have done throughout our history. And we will continue to make flying ever safer,\u201d said Willie Walsh, IATA\u2019s Director General. Regional breakdown The 2023 \u201call accident\u201d rate was better than the year before in all regions except North America and Asia Pacific. There were a number of close calls on US runways in 2023, with seven runway incursions \u2013 when planes get in the way of one another on the runway \u2013 recorded by mid-March alone. Europe has maintained a fatality risk of zero since 2018. However, the biggest chunk of the non-fatal airplane incidents in the region were related to landing gear collapse. Says the IATA: \u201cChallenges persist in the critical phases of flight, especially during landing and take-off, with over half of all accidents occurring during 2014-2023 occurring during these phases.\u201d Africa had the highest accident rate with 6.38 accidents per million sectors in 2023, although that\u2019s improving on the year before and there haven\u2019t been any fatal accidents in the region since 2020. North Asia was the safest region in the world. Its accident rate dropped from 0.45 accidents per million sectors down to 0.00 in 2023, while the fatality risk dropped from 0.23 in 2022 in 0.00 in 2023. The collision at Tokyo Haneda in January 2024 will impact North Asia\u2019s safety performance for this year, although the Japan Airlines crew were praised for their excellent execution of safety protocol, which prevented this particular disaster turning into a much greater tragedy.

            "text": "Boeing faces yet another federal probe over its 737 Max door plug blowout, this one by the Justice Department, an investigation that could expose it to criminal liability. Justice is reviewing whether deficiencies found in the wake the door plug blowout on a 737 Max flight last month violate a deferred prosecution agreement that Boeing signed with the government three years ago following two Max fatal crashes,\u00a0according to a person familiar with the investigation. Prosecutors are looking at whether the latest troubles at Boeing are covered under the previous deal under which Boeing paid $2.5 billion to settle allegations that Boeing defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the initial certification process for the 737 Max. The investigation was first reported by\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0and\u00a0Bloomberg. The reported probe adds to a lengthy list of investigations into Boeing\u2019s actions after part of an Alaska Airlines flight blew off the side of the plane on January 5. No one was seriously injured. The Justice review could expose Boeing to broader criminal liability if officials decide Boeing may have violated a controversial legal agreement that was due to expire on\u00a0January 7,\u00a0two days\u00a0after the door plug incident. It was not immediately clear what part of the agreement Boeing may have violated. Boeing said it had no comment on the reports of the Justice investigation. Families of passengers who died in the 2018 and 2019 crashes of 737 Maxes \u2013 the crashes that led to the deferred prosecution agreement \u2013 tried to overturn the agreement, saying a federal victims law should have given them a say.\u00a0 In the days after the door plug incident on Alaska Airlines flight 1282, an attorney for the families asked the Justice Department to review whether Boeing violated the agreement. The agreement cost Boeing $2.5 billion in 2021, but most of that money \u2013 $1.77 billion \u2013 went to compensate the company\u2019s airline customers, money it had already agreed to pay for the 20-month grounding of the jets following the crashes. It also included a $243.6 million criminal fine and a $500 million to fund a compensation for family members of the crash victims. Boeing is subject to several other investigations stemming from the door plug incident. The FAA last month informed Boeing it is probing whether the company failed to ensure its planes \u201cconformed to its approved design\u201d and that they were in compliance with FAA safety regulations. The FAA is also completing an audit of Boeing\u2019s manufacturing processes and a survey of Boeing\u2019s employees. Wednesday the agency gave Boeing 90 days to produce a plan to fix serious quality and safety issues. The National Transportation Safety Board continues to investigate the door plug incident and recently reported that critical bolts that hold the door plug in place were not installed in Boeing\u2019s factory. The NTSB has yet to determine blame or fault for the door plug incident on the Alaska Air flight. That will come later in its investigation, perhaps a year or more from now. But Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told investors in January, \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.\u201d A\u00a0year-long FAA-commissioned panel review this week was sharply critical of the safety culture at Boeing, finding executives and employees are not on the same page about safety, and that employees fear retaliation for speaking up.

            "text": "A little more than 10 years ago, in October 2013, a Wizz Air A320 arriving from Budapest made headlines by becoming the first commercial passenger flight ever to touch down at Al Maktoum International Airport, also known as Dubai World Central (DWC). This brand new \u201cgreenfield\u201d airport some 20 miles southwest of downtown Dubai was designed to become, in a not-so-distant future, the world\u2019s largest and busiest. The vision was \u2013 and still is \u2013 for a futuristic mega-hub, ensuring that the emirate\u2019s role as a major node of the global economy doesn\u2019t run into capacity problems anytime soon. Dubai Airports, the airport authority that manages both Dubai International (DXB) and the new airport, promises that when Al Maktoum International is finished, it\u2018ll be able to handle more than 160 million passengers per year as well as 12 million tonnes of freight. To put that in perspective, that\u2019s nearly 63 million more travelers than the world\u2019s current busiest airport, Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International, handled in 2022 and nearly 100 million more than Dubai International.\u00a0DXB, let\u2019s not forget, is already the world\u2019s busiest airport outside of the US and Dubai\u2019s main international gateway. However, a decade and a pandemic after that initial passenger flight, and a full 13 years since it first opened for cargo operations, Dubai\u2019s newest airport is still very much a work in progress. DWC has found a role as a center for aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul \u2013 \u201cMRO\u201d in industry parlance. It also hosts a number of air cargo operators (including Emirates Cargo, the freight subsidiary of the UAE flag carrier) and handles executive jets and some charter flights. Scheduled passenger services, however, are limited to those provided by a handful of low-cost carriers that operate services mostly to Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia. So what\u2019s been happening with those ambitious plans? And when might we see a timeline or new designs? \u2018Airport of the future\u2019 The recent Dubai Air Show, held at a purpose-built venue at Al Maktoum International Airport in 2023, offered some intriguing hints about what\u2019s ahead for DWC \u2013 and some insights into Dubai Airports\u2019 long-term strategy. \u201cWe have prioritized expansion and investments at DXB to meet our customers\u2019 requirements and plans,\u201d Paul Griffiths, Dubai Airports CEO, tells CNN. \u201cThis will continue until all possible capacity is absorbed.\u201d The plan is to maximize current capacity through \u201cthe application of innovative technology and refurbishments to rethink the use of space,\u201d says Griffiths, adding another 20 million passengers to DXB\u2019s current annual capacity of 100 million passengers. \u201cThis expansion will not only accommodate near-term growth but also provide us with additional time to strategize for the phased expansion of DWC. Our passenger forecasts for 2023 stand at 86.8 million, with projections of 88.2 million and 93.8 million for 2024 and 2025, respectively,\u201d he adds. Griffiths has been careful not to confirm a timeline, but in November 2023 he told the AFP news agency that when capacity is reached \u201cwe are going to need a new airport [\u2026] That is going to have to happen at some stage during the 2030s.\u201d \u201cDWC is a thrilling prospect,\u201d Griffiths told CNN in January this year. \u201cThe future Phase 2 development represents a significant opportunity, allowing us to build from the ground up in alignment with Dubai\u2019s broader goals and growth plans.\u201d Griffiths told reporters at the air show that designs are already being produced for the new mega-airport, but the massive, three-dimensional scale model displayed at the event, with its six parallel runways and three gigantic terminals, is already some years outdated. Changing the business model However, Griffiths has hinted to Business Traveller magazine about an intriguing modular approach to gradually expand DWC on a timeline that might run into the 2050s. \u201cWe are not planning an airport that has terminals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to completely change the business model for airports, make them actually far more intimate, and get rid of all the legacy processes that we\u2019ve had to subject our customers to, for far too long.\u201d The airport will be the centerpiece of a much larger scheme, called Dubai South, that envisages the creation of a whole new city in a 145-square-kilometer stretch of desert just south of Dubai. This entire new district, of which some pieces are already starting to take shape, will have eight neighborhoods each allocated to a specific industry or activity, with a mix of residential and commercial areas as well. With the airport at the heart of the action, it will form a complete \u201caerotropolis\u201d. The Mohammed bin Rashid (MBR) Aerospace Hub, which will host Dubai\u2019s burgeoning aviation and aerospace industrial ecosystem, including the recently announced $950 million Emirates engineering center, will be playing a very prominent role in this vision. The real turning point, however, will come the day local giant Emirates and its smaller partner, flyDubai, relocate to the new airport from their current home at Dubai International. This move has long been on the cards, but it has no known timeframe yet. According to Nadine Itani, program leader for air transport management at the University of Surrey in England, Emirates\u2019 shift to DWC is more than a relocation. \u201cIt\u2019s a strategic realignment in response to the changing dynamics of the global air travel and trade market,\u201d says the aviation expert, who notes that Dubai\u2019s bet on DWC as a future mega-hub is not an isolated move. There is currently a race in the region to invest in new, large-scale airport facilities and no one wants to lag behind. The region\u2019s flag carriers are not only keen to claim their share of global travel flows and position their capital cities as international trade centers, but also, increasingly, to establish themselves as tourist destinations in their own right. Shiny new airports will support these efforts. \u201cThere has been a notable shift in the incoming traffic mix into Dubai with a decrease in connecting passengers and an increase in terminating passengers, coupled with the anticipated surge in transport and logistics activity due to Dubai\u2019s role in the planned trade agreements such as the [India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor],\u201d says Itani. Inaugurated as recently as 2014, Hamad International Airport in nearby Qatar, a direct competitor of Dubai in the long-haul connectivity market, is gearing to expand its capacity to more than 60 million annual passengers. This adds to other airport expansion projects in the region: the opening of a $1.8 billion brand new airport in Muscat, Oman, in 2018, the $1.1 billion new terminal in Bahrain in 2021 and, more recently, in November 2023, of Abu Dhabi\u2019s grand new Terminal A, a 780,000-square-meter facility able to handle up to 79 aircraft simultaneously. At the northern end of the Gulf, Kuwait International Airport is building a new terminal designed by renowned British architectural firm Foster+Partners, which will have the capacity to handle 25 million passengers per year initially, with the possibility of doubling it up to 50 million in the future. And less than 20 miles from Dubai\u2019s downtown, Sharjah International Airport, which is primarily home to low-cost carrier Air Arabia, is also increasing its capacity to 20 million passengers annually. Saudi Arabia is also readying a massive airport expansion as part of its 2030 Vision, which has allocated $100 billion to prop up the kingdom\u2019s air connectivity and turn it into one of the world\u2019s top tourist destinations. In addition to a new international airline, Riyadh Air, the Saudi capital is also getting a gigantic new airport. Riyadh\u2019s new six-runway airport will, in fact, be built at the same location as the current one, fully replacing it. It will have capacity for 185 million passengers per year, or almost seven times the number it handled in 2022. When it comes to claiming the top spot in the global airport league tables, the stakes are higher than ever.",

The agency said FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker and Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun held a day-long meeting on Tuesday where Whitaker made the demand. That meeting came the day after a year-long FAA-commissioned probe found a \u201cdisconnect\u201d between Boeing executives and employees on safety and said employees fear reassignment or stalled career growth for reporting safety issues. The meeting preceded the anticipated release of a six-week FAA audit of Boeing\u2019s production line \u2013 an audit spurred by investigators\u2019 finding that critical bolts were not installed on a Boeing 737 Max 9 door plug that blew open mid-flight. The FAA said the Boeing plan must address weaknesses in implementing the company\u2019s Safety Management System, known as SMS, as well as integrating the SMS program with another quality program. SMS is a manual which is supposed to guide employees on procedures they should follow to insure planes are safe. But the panel said despite a wholesale re-write of the manual in recent years, it found \u201cmany Boeing employees did not demonstrate knowledge of Boeing\u2019s SMS efforts, nor its purpose and procedures.\u201d The panel that reported on Boeing\u2019s safety shortcomings on Monday recommended the company address those issues within six months; the FAA\u2019s new directive sets a faster timeline. The resulting plan from Boeing must lead to a \u201cmeasurable, systemic shift in manufacturing quality control,\u201d the FAA said. Boeing has had a history of safety lapses. The January 5 blowout incident\u00a0triggered a 19-day emergency grounding of all Max 9s and re-ignited scrutiny of Boeing following the fatal Max 8 crashes of 2018 and 2019.

Despite Boeing\u2019s repreated claims of its commitment to safety procedures, the report by a panel of industry experts said it did not find \u201cobjective evidence of a foundational commitment to safety that matched Boeing\u2019s descriptions of that objective.\u201d Some Boeing employees did not understand their role in safety and feared retaliation for raising safety-related concerns, according to the report by federal safety experts. The panel, created after fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019\u00a0but before the recent incident in which a door plug blew out the side of an aircraft,\u00a0found \u201cgaps in Boeing\u2019s safety journey.\u201d It also identified \u201chesitation in reporting safety concerns for fear of retaliation\u201d because of management conflicts of interest and said confusion about the safety programs \u201cmay discourage employees from submitting safety concerns.\u201d Boeing said in a statement to CNN that it has \u201ctaken important steps to foster a safety culture that empowers and encourages all employees to share their voice. But there is more work to do.\u201d \u201cWe will carefully review the panel\u2019s assessment and learn from their findings, as we continue our comprehensive efforts to improve our safety and quality programs,\u201d Boeing\u2019s statement said. It also included a quote from CEO Dave Calhoun that urged \u201call teammates to use their voices to speak up.\u201d But the report documented a \u201cdisconnect between Boeing\u2019s senior management and other members of the organization on safety culture.\u201d The panel was made up of Federal Aviation Administration officials and representatives from airlines, labor unions and safety units at other aerospace companies.\u00a0Its work included conducting more than 250 interviews and reviewing more than 4,000 pages of documents and focused on both safety culture and the FAA program that delegates some aircraft certification work to Boeing employees. The panel was not charged with reporting on any specific incident involving Boeing aircraft. \u201cHowever on several occasions during the expert panel\u2019s activities, serious quality issues with Boeing products became public. These quality issues amplified the expert panel\u2019s concerns that the safety-related messages or behaviors are not being implemented across the entire Boeing population,\u201d the report said. In particular, it found Boeing repeatedly revised its Safety Management System \u2013 or SMS \u2013 manual, which is supposed to guide employees on procedures they should follow to insure planes are safe. But the panel said despite a wholesale re-write of the manual in recent years, it found \u201cmany Boeing employees did not demonstrate knowledge of Boeing\u2019s SMS efforts, nor its purpose and procedures.\u201d The panel recommended the company re-work safety procedures so that they can be \u201cclearly understood and followed by employees at all levels of Boeing.\u201d Certain Boeing employees are delegated special FAA powers allowing them to make decisions that go against Boeing\u2019s interest. Some of those employees told the panel that Boeing managers treated them differently, sometimes re-assigning them.\u00a0And while the company has made some changes to deter retaliation, the report said the current structure \u201cstill allows opportunities for retaliation to occur,\u201d including decisions regarding salary. That unit \u2013 the Organization Designation Authorization team, or ODA \u2013 is\u00a0also\u00a0losing key experience due to employees leaving or retiring, the report said. This story has been updated with additional reporting and context.",

            "text": "Berkshire Hathaway neared a $1 trillion market valuation Monday after a record-breaking year, but\u00a0CEO Warren Buffett warned in his annual letter to investors that more skyrocketing performances are likely a thing of the past. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) saw its shares jump nearly 2%, to $429, on Monday morning after closing with a market cap of $905 billion on Friday. Only a handful of companies worldwide has ever reached the $1 trillion milestone, among them tech giants Amazon, Apple and Microsoft. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate reported a record cash hoard Saturday in its fourth-quarter earnings. Berkshire has about $167.6 billion in cash and equivalents, breaking last quarter\u2019s record-high $157.2 billion. For the year, operating earnings rose to $37.3 billion, after setting a record of $30.8 billion in 2022. But in Buffett\u2019s annual letter to shareholders over the weekend, the famed investor and CEO said he sought to manage expectations. He emphasized that longevity and constancy are at the core of the company\u2019s ethos, adding that seismic deals and skyrocketing performance are likely a thing of the past. \u201cBerkshire should do a bit better than the average American corporation and, more important, should also operate with materially less risk of permanent loss of capital,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnything beyond \u2018slightly better,\u2019 though, is wishful thinking.\u201d The Oracle of Omaha noted a lack of opportunity for Berkshire Hathaway to invest in or acquire companies that would make a strong financial impression on the conglomerate\u2019s performance. That is especially true for businesses outside the United States, Buffett said, noting that internationally, \u201cthere are essentially no candidates that are meaningful options for capital deployment at Berkshire.\u201d In 2023, Berkshire increased its investment in five major Japanese companies: Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo. The companies span a wide range of industries, including textile production, mining, electricity and automotive manufacturing. Since the interest in these companies is \u201cmore broad\u201d than Berkshire\u2019s, Buffett said there \u201cis the possibility that our investment may lead to opportunities for us to partner around the world with (these) five large, well-managed and well-respected companies.\u201d But due to Berkshire\u2019s size, buying shares to build a large position in these companies is a long-term undertaking that requires patience, Buffett said. \u201cThe process is like turning a battleship,\u201d he wrote.",

            "text": "Amazon on Monday was officially added to Wall Street\u2019s most venerable stock index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average. S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the index, said last week that Walgreens Boots Alliance would be getting the boot from the 30-stock index. The change is intended to reflect \u201cthe evolving nature of the American economy\u201d by increasing the Dow\u2019s consumer retail exposure. The change means that investors who bet on the Dow will now have exposure to Amazon\u2019s stock performance. Amazon joins Apple and Microsoft as the third company from the \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d a group of high-performing tech stocks, to join the Dow 30. The other four companies in the group \u2014 Meta, Nvidia, Tesla, and Alphabet \u2014 are not included in the index, though all seven stocks are included in the much larger S&P 500 index. Historically, getting added to or dropped from the Dow hasn\u2019t had a significant impact on a company\u2019s stock performance. But presence in the index, which began in 1896, comes with a certain level of cachet. The exclusive group traditionally tries to mirror the most important companies in the US economy. That is why the index is so heavily dominated by technology stocks today. Walgreens currently has the lowest stock price in the index, and is down 68% in the past five years. Amazon shares fell 0.1% on Monday morning. Meanwhile, Uber replaced JetBlue Airways in the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which tracks 20 US transportation stocks from railroads to airlines to delivery. The move will give the index exposure to the ridesharing industry, and came about from JetBlue\u2019s nearly minuscule weighting in the price-weighted transports index, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.",

            "text": "Ryanair may be forced to cut flights and raise fares in the peak summer season this year because crisis-hit Boeing can\u2019t deliver the planes it promised. Michael O\u2019Leary, the CEO of Europe\u2019s biggest airline by passenger numbers, said during a widely-reported press briefing Friday that air fares could rise as much as 10% partly because of delays to aircraft deliveries. Boeing has been hit by new safety and quality concerns since early January, when a piece of fuselage on a 737 Max 9, operated by Alaska Airlines,\u00a0blew out mid-flight. Further problems have come to light with some 737s since, disrupting Boeing\u2019s production schedule. It has also postponed certification of two new versions of the jet. Until recently, Ryanair was expecting Boeing to deliver 57 Max 8-200 planes by the end of April, Reuters reported O\u2019Leary as saying. On Friday, the CEO said he was \u201cpretty sure\u201d the airline would receive between 30 and 40 aircraft, but \u201cfar less confident\u201d of getting between 45 and 50. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know how many aircraft we\u2019re going to get from Boeing,\u201d he said, according to Reuters. A Ryanair spokesperson told CNN that the reports of O\u2019Leary\u2019s media briefing were accurate and that the company had nothing further to add at this time. If only 40 aircraft are delivered, Ryanair may have to \u201cannounce some minor schedule cuts\u201d by the end of March, O\u2019Leary was reported as saying. That could bump up air fares by between 5% and 10% this summer. Demand for international travel rebounded strongly last year, causing airfares to soar around the world. Ryanair\u2019s Ireland-listed stock has risen 69% since the start of 2023. \u201cIt\u2019s inexcusable. Boeing will try to claim that it\u2019s excusable. I think we (will) get some modest compensation out of Boeing,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cAt the point our focus is getting the bloody airplanes.\u201d A spokesperson for Boeing (BA) said the company was communicating with customers over changes to its delivery schedule. \u201cWe (are taking) the necessary time to make sure that every airplane we deliver is high quality and meets all customer and regulatory requirements.\u201d \u201cWe deeply regret the impact this is having on our valued customer Ryanair. We\u2019re working to address their concerns and taking action on a comprehensive plan to strengthen 737\u00a0quality and delivery performance.\u201d O\u2019Leary\u2019s comments come nearly a month after he expressed \u201ca lot of confidence\u201d in Boeing\u2019s leadership. He praised efforts by David Calhoun and Brian West, Boeing\u2019s CEO and chief financial officer respectively, to turn the company around. \u201cI think safety is their number one byword,\u201d he said in a\u00a0video\u00a0posted on Ryanair\u2019s website.",

            "text": "While the A380 superjumbo is enjoying a steady resurgence after having been on the brink of retirement during the pandemic, its older sibling \u2013 another four-engined aircraft from Airbus \u2013 seems dangerously close to being grounded for good. The A340 was introduced 30 years ago with Lufthansa and Air France, but only 380 have been produced since, the last in 2012. By comparison, Airbus has already made 565 of its successor, the A350, since its introduction in 2015. Despite the lackluster commercial response, Airbus had high hopes for the A340, which was meant to replace aging Boeing 747s and DC-10s, and was touted as having an unbeatable range. Just after entering commercial service, in 1993, an A340 set records by flying from the Paris Air Show to Auckland, in New Zealand, and then back after a five-hour layover, totaling over 42 hours in the air. It was the first-ever nonstop flight between Europe and New Zealand and the longest-ever nonstop flight by an airliner. In its heyday, the plane was used to operate the longest nonstop scheduled flight in the world, and was for a while the aircraft of choice for heads of state around the world due to its range and size. But its main characteristic \u2013 the four engines \u2013 soon became a drag as fuel costs started rising and twin-engine jets began offering the same performance with lower operating costs. By the early 2000s, the A340\u2019s main competitor \u2014 the twin-engined Boeing 777 \u2014 was outselling it 10 to one. It had even taken away the longest flight record, with a nonstop journey from Seattle to Kuala Lumpur in 1997. \u201cThe A340 disappeared essentially because twinjets could fulfill its mission more efficiently,\u201d says Gary Crichlow, an aviation analyst at consulting firm AviationValues. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason complex organisms evolved to have no more than two of any large, energy-guzzling organ: because when you can\u2019t get away with one, two offers the best bang for the buck. Three or more is overkill.\u201d Two is better than four There are currently just 64 A340s in service with 17 airlines globally, according to data provided to CNN by aviation analytics firm Cirium. That\u2019s about half as many as were in service before the pandemic, in early 2019. Only Lufthansa is operating more than 10, with many leading airlines having abandoned the type completely, like Air France, Iberia, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic, all of which used to operate substantial fleets. A worrying sign of the A340\u2019s imminent demise is that there are currently no airlines operating the A340-500 variant, which Airbus introduced in 2003 as the world\u2019s longest-range commercial airliner. Between 2004 and 2013, the -500 variant was used by Singapore Airlines to operate the world\u2019s longest flight, from Newark to Singapore. \u201cThe route was discontinued because Singapore Airlines couldn\u2019t generate enough revenue to offset the cost, particularly with fuel,\u201d says Crichlow. One of the main factors driving four-engine jets to extinction is that newer and more reliable twin-engined jets, like the 787 and the A350, have progressively obtained better safety ratings that allowed them to fly for longer in case of loss of power from one of the two engines. Previously, four-engined jets had an advantage in this area. \u201cClearly, shutting down one engine on a twinjet is a bigger deal than shutting down one on a quadjet,\u201d says Crichlow. \u201cBut starting in the late 1990s with the introduction of the Boeing 777, up to three hours of single-engine flight time was allowed for eligible operators. \u201cToday, the certification record is for the Airbus A350 with up to 370 minutes, or about 2,500 nautical miles. With the kind of routing flexibility that certification offers, airlines who want to service far-flung city pairs simply don\u2019t need four engines anymore.\u201d As a result, only eight A340-500s are left out of the 34 built. Only two of those are still in a passenger layout, with Azerbaijan Airlines, and they\u2019ve been parked since November 2022 and March 2023 respectively, Crichlow adds. Of the remaining six, five are in use by governments and one is outfitted for corporate and VIP flights. Rare beauty Sam Chui, an aviation enthusiast and blogger who has flown on the A340 over 50 times, remembers being on board the Newark to Singapore flight when it was the longest in the world. \u201cThat flight lasted around 19 hours on average,\u201d Chui says. Initially, Singapore operated it in a traditional two-class configuration, but in the final years it changed things up. \u201cThey moved to an all-business class - 100 seats only, on a very large airplane that typically can fit 300 airplane seats. It was a fairly quiet cabin.\u201d Passengers liked the plane, but it wasn\u2019t without problems. \u201cOn a long flight from Hong Kong to London on the A340-300, they would often leave a lot of baggage behind when the plane was full,\u201d Chui adds. \u201cThe Singapore flight took a long time to take off in the US \u2013 three-quarters of the full runway.\u201d Oddly enough for a passenger aircraft, the A340 was believed to be somewhat underpowered and acquired a reputation of being slow. \u201cIt was the only plane to be hit by bird strikes from behind,\u201d jokes Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at Aerodynamic Advisor. \u201cThe original A340 was slow, fuel-thirsty, and, thanks to having four engines, both heavy and costly to maintain. The stretched and re-engined variants weren\u2019t much better and by the time they were launched, it was very clear that twin-engine jets could do anything quads could do, at lower cost and with less maintenance.\u201d Without any cargo version \u2013 which usually prolongs the lifespan of an aircraft, as in the case of the Boeing 747 \u2013 it\u2019s likely that the A340 will disappear from the skies entirely within a decade or two. For now, however, the type still has some life left in it, and is even flying to one of the world\u2019s most challenging destinations, Antarctica: Charter airline HiFly is operating flights to the region with an A340-300, carrying scientists and a small group of tourists. Many will miss it when it\u2019s gone. \u201cThe A340 is, almost inarguably, the prettiest of all the Airbus jets, and I\u2019m sad to see fewer and fewer of them around,\u201d says Patrick Smith, an airline pilot flying Boeing aircraft and the author of the popular book and blog \u201cAsk the Pilot.\u201d \u201cIn an age of boring aesthetic sameness among commercial jets, it has always set itself apart,\u201d he adds. \u201cMy favorite A340 variant is the -600, with the stretched fuselage and the huge Rolls-Royce engines. What a beauty. I once took an extra-early departure out of Bangkok just for the opportunity to fly on the -600.\u201d As its numbers dwindle, the A340 will increasingly turn into a planespotter\u2019s favorite. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting airplane to watch, especially when it takes off at the very last minute,\u201d says Chui. \u201cThese are now very rare, and that makes them more interesting for aviation enthusiasts. Certainly something different compared to twin-engine aircraft.\u201d",

            "text": "Travelers who were hoping to experience Qantas\u2019 long-awaited, record-breaking \u2018Project Sunrise\u2019 flights next year will have to be a bit more patient. Australia\u2019s flag carrier said on Thursday that manufacturing delays have impacted the delivery dates for the Airbus A350-1000 jets that will be used to service the ultra-long-haul flights by approximately six months, to mid-2026. In 2022, Qantas ordered 12 of the planes for the 19-hour-plus journeys that will connect Australia with New York and London. The inaugural flights were scheduled to launch in late 2025, starting with Sydney to London and New York. A senior executive at Airbus reportedly responded to the timeline shift on the sidelines of the Singapore Airshow this week. \u201cThe regulator has asked us to redesign the center tank on the ultra-long-range airplane for Sunrise,\u201d Christian Scherer, CEO of Airbus\u2019 commercial aircraft business, was quoted by Reuters as saying. Project Sunrise: A timeline By the time the flights do take off, it will have been nearly a decade since the world first heard about them. Project Sunrise was announced by Qantas in 2017, a plan to operate the world\u2019s longest nonstop flights, allowing travelers to fly directly between London or New York to the eastern Australian cities of Sydney and Melbourne. The name was inspired by the secretive, danger-filled flights made from Perth to Sri Lanka en route to London during World War II. They lasted so long pilots saw two sunrises. In 2019, Qantas conducted three trial research trips to gather data to present to Australia\u2019s Civil Aviation Safety Authority, which needed proof that pilots, cabin crew and passengers can cope with up to 22 hours in the air without a break. During these flights, pilots wore brainwave monitors and had their urine tested in the weeks before and after the flights to track levels of melatonin, a hormone that controls sleep cycles. Passengers in the main cabin wore monitoring devices, allowing scientists to study how their \u201chealth, well-being and body clock\u201d were impacted by a set of variables including lighting, food and drink, movement, sleep patterns and inflight entertainment. One of the trial flights, Flight QF7879 \u2013 which\u00a0CNN experienced first-hand\u00a0\u2013 became the world\u2019s longest passenger flight by a commercial airline both for distance (17,800 kilometers, or about 11,060 miles) and duration in the air (19 hours and 19 minutes). That same year, Qantas announced it was choosing Airbus over Boeing to carry out the Project Sunrise flights. Both aircraft makers had pitched their jets to the airline in a competitive months-long process, with Boeing offering up the 777X and Airbus the A350. And then came the pandemic. The ultra-long-haul routes were set to launch in 2022 or 2023, but with the global health crisis decimating the global aviation industry, Project Sunrise was put on hold in 2020 \u2013 but not forgotten. In 2022, Qantas announced it was ordering 12 Airbus A350-1000 jets for the project. How comfortable will the flights be? The Project Sunrise planes\u2019 interiors were revealed in 2023, highlighting steps designers have taken to ensure passengers will be as comfortable as possible during the ultra-long flights. The A350s will seat only 238 passengers, a sharp drop from the usual 300-plus seat layout, to provide more space for fliers. The layout includes six first class seats in a 1-1-1 configuration, 52 business class seats in 1-2-1, 40 premium economy seats in 2-4-2 and 140 economy seats in 3-3-3. The first class cabin seats, or First Suites, will feature an extra-wide fixed bed, a 22-inch wide recliner lounge chair, a full-length wardrobe, a folding dining table \u2013 large enough for two \u2013 and a 32-inch ultra-high definition TV. Business class suites will be 42 inches wide with 25-inch-wide chairs that can be reclined into a two-meter bed. They will also include a cushioned leather ottoman, a large mirror, plenty of storage space and an 18-inch ultra-high definition touchscreen TV. All Business and First Suites will be enclosed by high walls and have a sliding door for privacy. They will also have multiple charging options for personal devices, including a wireless induction charging dock.

            "text": "Boeing removed executive Ed Clark, the head of its 737 Max passenger jet program, after a dramatic \u2013 and terrifying \u2013 midair blowout in January underscored ongoing problems with the jet. The 737 Max is Boeing\u2019s best selling plane, but has been a source of repeated problems over the last five years, starting with a 20-month grounding in 2019 and 2020 following two crashes that killed a total of 346 people. More recently, a door plug on a Boeing 737 Max flown by Alaska Airlines blew out soon after taking off, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the four bolts that should have held the door plug in place were missing when the plane left Boeing\u2019s factory. The NTSB report did not assess blame for the missing bolts and the accident but in a statement to investors before the findings were released, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun assumed responsibility for the incident. \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that,\u201d he told investors during a call after reporting the latest quarterly loss at the company. \u201cWhatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.\u201d Clark, who had been at Boeing for 18 years, had only been in charge of the Max program since March of 2021, assuming that title after the jets had been returned to service following the crashes. But he had previously held roles related to the 737 Max, including as chief engineer and chief 737 mechanic. With the news of Clark\u2019s departure, Boeing also announced a shuffling of a number of executives in its Boeing Commercial Airplanes unit. It created a new executive position, Senior Vice President for BCA Quality, and named Elizabeth Lund to that position. Lund had been senior vice president and general manager of airplane programs for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, overseeing not just the 737 Max but other models of passenger jets made by the company. Mike Fleming, who had previously been senior vice president of development and customer service, will assume the role Lund previously held. And Katie Ringgold, who had been vice president of 737 Max deliveries, will assume Clark\u2019s former position overseeing the Max. Beyond the problems that have resulted in the grounding of the 737 Max 8 and Max 9 after the incidents, the problems at Boeing have also postponed certification of two new versions of the jet, the Max 7 and a stretched version, the Max 10. The CEOs of three key Boeing customers \u2013 United Airlines, Southwest and Delta Air Lines \u2013 have recently all said they no longer are counting on getting those new versions of the planes they had ordered anytime soon. United CEO Scott Kirby referred to the Alaska Air incident as the \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d in terms of his airline\u2019s planning assumptions for the Max 10.

            "text": "Walmart doesn\u2019t want to just sell groceries and t-shirts. It wants to be a media and advertising giant like Amazon. Walmart announced Tuesday that it\u2019s buying TV maker Vizio for $2.3 billion to shore up its advertising business and create a more potent rival to Amazon\u2019s booming ad business. Walmart currently sells ads at physical stores and its website. By acquiring Vizio, Walmart can now sell ads through streaming services on television. \u201cThis accelerates Walmart\u2019s advertising as it moves into streaming TV opportunities,\u201d said Andrew Lipsman, an independent media analyst. The acquisition could make Walmart a bigger presence in the TV streaming wars, especially if Walmart acquires a streaming service, Lipsman said. Roku, a streaming competitor, last week noted that television advertisers are increasing the amount they spend on streaming ads as customers continue to cut the cable cord. Roku and Amazon sell advertising space on their various streaming channels and home screens, and they sell licensing arrangements for companies to put their brand on certain shows. They also sell space to apps and media channels to advertise their movies and shows on customers\u2019 screens. Advertising and groceries Walmart believes it can add revenue by offering brands the opportunity to advertise on Vizio televisions. Vizio\u2019s Smart TV operating system, SmartCast, has more than 18 million active accounts. The deal would give Walmart more ways to offer ads through Vizio televisions, as well as create entertainment options exclusively for customers with Vizio TVs. This \u201capproach gives Walmart a lot more power and reach in the world of advertising and puts it on a more level playing field with the likes of Amazon,\u201d said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at GlobalData Retail. Walmart wants a bigger slice of brands\u2019 advertising spending to supplement its primary low-margin retail business. Groceries, which make up more than half of Walmart sales, carry razor-thin margins. Walmart has also sacrificed profit in recent years by investing billions of dollars to build out its digital operation. The company believes that building new revenue streams, such as higher-margin advertising dollars, can help offset Walmart\u2019s heavy spending and boost profit. Advertising \u201cThe deal underlines that retail is becoming a much more diversified business than it used to be,\u201d Saunders said. Walmart has been pitching advertisers in recent years on its ability to reach customers. It has a trove of shopper data because 90% of America shops at Walmart every year, and its website and stores attract some 160 million visitors a week. Walmart is pitching availability of their specific consumer sales data \u2013 online and brick and mortar \u2013 to curate and target those ads across all platforms. Its advertising business reached $3.4 billion last year, but makes up less than 1% of its total sales. Other retailers are also building their advertising businesses, such as Kroger and Target. These retailers are following Amazon, which has become the third largest advertising company behind Google and Facebook. Amazon\u2019s ad services business grew 27% last quarter, and made up around 15% of its total sales. Walmart says some prices are falling Walmart\u2019s announcement came as it reported strong sales and earnings during its most recent quarter, sending its stock up 3% during pre-market trading Tuesday. The company said it gained market share in groceries and general merchandise, particularly among higher-income households. Digital sales in particular were a bright spot. And it expected a strong 2024, although it forecast sales to slow a bit from last year. Walmart said it saw prices start to fall in home goods, toys and other seasonal categories. Grocery inflation has also moderated. Lower prices would be welcome news for shoppers. But it could be\u00a0dangerous for the economy. Falling prices can indicate weak demand, and consumer spending is a big portion of the economy.",

            "text": "Beijing\u2019s C919 airliner, a potential rival to Western-made Boeing and Airbus planes, made its first foray outside Chinese territory on Sunday by staging a flyby at the Singapore Airshow. The single-aisle jet, manufactured by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), is a prominent symbol\u00a0of Beijing\u2019s broader\u00a0\u201cMade in China\u201d strategy, which aims to reduce reliance on foreign manufacturers. China calls the C919, which can carry just under 200 passengers,\u00a0its first large homegrown passenger jet. The aircraft took to the skies for its first commercial flight last May. It s certified to carry passengers only within mainland China and flies with China Eastern Airlines. This is \u201cthe first time we will be having exhibitors from China,\u201d Cindy Koh, executive vice-president of Singapore\u2019s Economic Development Board, one of the airshow\u2019s organizers, told reporters Sunday. At the show, which started officially on Tuesday, China\u2019s state-owned Tibet Airlines announced an order for 40 C919 jets, plus 10 of the smaller ARJ21 regional jets that Comac also makes, according to Chinese state media Global Times. China has made no secret of its ambition to eventually compete against Boeing (BA) and Airbus (ABNB). The C919\u2019s overseas debut comes at a time when Boeing is making headlines for all the wrong reasons. Last month, part of the fuselage of a 737 Max 9 Boeing plane fell off during an Air Alaska flight in the United States. Shukor Yusof, founder of Endau Analytics, a firm that tracks the aviation industry, said the C919 would be \u201cthe most scrutinized aircraft at the Singapore Airshow,\u201d an event that draws company executives\u00a0and high-ranking government officials from around the world. \u201cThere is a lot of interest to see the actual aircraft, how it performs and how it is in flight,\u201d he said. Currently, only a handful of countries make their own planes because of extremely high barriers to entry in the industry. A high level of technical expertise, as well as huge amounts of time and resources, is needed. The C919, for instance, has cost its backer an estimated $49 billion in development, manufacturing and other costs,\u00a0according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, though it says pinning down precisely how much is a tough task because Comac\u2019s finances are opaque. In December, it conducted a demonstration flight in Hong Kong\u2019s Victoria Harbour, in its first voyage outside mainland China. Yusof said rising tensions between Beijing and Washington would also make it difficult for Comac to find a market in the West. \u201cYou can\u2019t run away (from) all the politics with China and the rest of the world, and that sigma is going to stick with them for quite a while,\u201d he said. The model has not yet been certified by American and European aviation regulators, which Yusof said was \u201ca big disadvantage.\u201d With capacity to fly between five to six hours, the C919 is perfect for regional travel, he added, saying it had the potential to appeal to countries in Southeast Asia, Africa and Central Asia, which are politically more friendly to China. \u201cIt will become a competitor in a small way, but it won\u2019t be in the same league as Airbus and Boeing,\u201d he said. Last year, Indonesian low-cost airline TransNusa became Comac\u2019s first overseas customer, snapping up its ARJ21, which can carry just under 100 passengers.",

            "text": "There was a huge bang. A massive hole opened up in the side of the plane, minutes into a flight. Wind and noise filled the cabin, clothes and phones were ripped from passengers and hurled into the void. The metal of airplane seats twisted towards the opening. It was an extremely lucky day.  Because for the 171 passengers, four flight attendants and two pilots on board Alaska Airlines flight 1282 who experienced all of that on January 5, it could have been so much worse. \u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that nobody died and there were not more serious injuries,\u201d Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, told CNN after touring the aircraft shortly after the incident. The preliminary report on the incident was released earlier this month, and one of the most alarming notes in a long litany of them was just how many flights the Boeing 737 Max 9 involved in the fateful incident took before the door plug blew off because it left the factory missing crucial bolts needed to keep it in place. The plane, tail number N704AL, had already been flying for Alaska for 10 weeks, going on 153 flights. Unbeknownst to passengers and crew that flew on it, and seemingly even the factory that built it, the terror that occurred was seemingly inevitable. Every time a modern commercial airliner goes up in the air, it ever-so-slightly expands and contracts, like a balloon being inflated and deflated. Each time it goes up, the cabin is pressurized so that the humans inside can breathe air thick with oxygen, unlike the thin, cold air just outside the aircraft\u2019s aluminum skin. Every time the plane pressurized and de-pressurized, there was an opportunity for the door plug to come undone. There were, accordingly, at least 153 opportunities. \u201cI think we were fortunate the door plug stayed in place as long as it did with the hardware missing,\u201d said Anthony Brickhouse, a crash investigator and professor of aviation safety at Embry Riddle University. Here\u2019s the ways in which Alaska Air \u2014 and Boeing \u2014 got lucky to have the plane finally develop problems when and how it did on January 5. The empty seats Seats 26A and 26B were the seats closest to the door plug. They were both also unoccupied during the flight, two of only seven open seats on the nearly full plane. The force of air when the hole opened up was enough to rip much of the seating material off of the seats and twist them towards the opening. A passenger sitting in the window seat, and possibly even the middle seat, might have been pushed through the opening by the force of the relatively high-pressure air on the inside rushing to the low-pressure environment at altitude on the outside. That\u2019s what happened on a Southwest flight in 2018, when part of an engine cowling broke free and shattered a window. The passenger sitting next to that window, Jennifer Riordan, 43, was expelled through the broken window. While other passengers were able to bring her back inside, she died as a result of blunt impact trauma of the head, neck and torso. It was also fortunate that there were no infants or toddlers who were being held by their parents in their laps near the opening. Alaska, as is the case with most airlines, allows \u201clap infants\u201d for passengers up to their second birthday. Brickhouse said had there been a lap infant in that row, there\u2019s a good chance they would have been lost through the opening. \u201cThere\u2019s been an effort to not allow lap children,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is it that you\u2019re required to be buckled in a car, but mommy and daddy can hold you on a flight? Hopefully it will highlight need to stop that.\u201d The altitude The door plug came out at 16,000 feet as the plane was still climbing. That means two things: 1) All the passengers were supposed to still be belted into their seats and not moving around the cabin. 2) There was still enough air to breathe as passengers got their oxygen masks on. Both would not have been the case had the door plug come out at the cruising altitude above 30,000 feet. \u201cAt cruising altitude, you\u2019d have quite a bit different effect on the passengers,\u201d said Mike Dostert, a technical advisor for the Foundation for Aviation Safety and a former engineer with both Boeing and the FAA. \u201cAir is so thin, particularly for eldery and younger passengers, you can end up with brain damage.\u201d And that also could have caused more damage to the fuselage itself said Brickhouse. \u201cThe higher you go, the faster you go, the more profound the structural failure is going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a rapid decompression at cruising altitude, it\u2019s going to be a much more violent situation.\u201d Where the plane was Records show that the plane made 22 of its 153 flights before January between Hawaii and the mainland. Those were flights that put it over the ocean for more than five hours, as much as 10 hours for those from Anchorage to Honolulu. Had the door blown out half-way through any of those flights, making it back to the nearest airport would have been a much more challenging endeavor than it was on January 5, when it was able to return to the airport in Portland within minutes of the incident. \u201cObviously if this plane had been halfway between the mainland and Hawaii, there would have been the question \u2014 are we pressing forward, are we turning around?\u201d said Brickhouse. The plane descending to a lower altitude, which it would have done on a prolonged flight, would have helped with the cabin pressure, and with the temperature in the cabin. But it would have forced the plane to burn far more fuel as it flew through the much denser atmosphere lower to the ground. It would have been depending on fuel reserves onboard the plane to be able to complete the flight. Damage to the plane The real nightmare scenario for experts is what happened to the door plug once it blew away. It apparently blew clear of the plane and did not cause any additional damage. But if the plug had gone straight back, it could have hit the rudder or the vertical stabilizers on the tail, which are crucial to the plane flying straight, level and under control. Aircraft that have lost these pieces have been known to crash, like Japan Air Lines Flight 123, which in lost its vertical stabilizer in 1985 and hit a mountain. There were only four survivors and more than 500 who died, some when a rescue was delayed. \u201cI think they\u2019re lucky it didn\u2019t hit the fuselage or the tail,\u201d said Joe Jacobsen, another former engineer for Boeing and the FAA. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty random where it went, whether it goes up, down or straight back. It depends on the orientation of the plane when it blew out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the question of how it hits the tail, what damage it does, whether it\u2019s a glancing blow or a direct hit.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the catastrophic scenario. They could have lost the whole airplane.\u201d NTSB Chair: It could happen again The Boeing 737 Max 9 that were grounded after the incident have all been inspected and returned to service. Alaska CEO Ben Minicucci said in an interview that the airline found loose bolts on many of the planes. And the NTSB\u2019s Homendy told CNN the day after the agency released its preliminary finding that while she is confident that the planes are now safe, that \u201cOf course, something like this can happen again.\u201d Minicucci apologized to passengers who were on the flight shortly after it happened. \u201cMy heart goes out to those who were on this flight \u2013 I am so sorry for what you experienced,\u201d he said. The airline referred further questions about the incident to the NTSB. Asked about the incident and what might have happened, Boeing referred to comments by CEO Dave Calhoun, who apologized and expressed horror about the incident in a message to Boeing employees four days after the flight. \u201cWhen I got that picture \u2026 I didn\u2019t know what happened to whoever was supposed to be in that seat in the airplane,\u201d he said. \u201cI got kids, I got grandkids and so do you. This stuff matters, everything matters, every detail matters.\u201d The NTSB has yet to assess fault or blame for the missing bolts that had been needed to keep the door plug in place. But in comments to investors in late January, Calhoun accepted responsibility for Boeing. \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that,\u201d he said in a call after reporting the latest quarterly loss at the company. \u201cWhatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better.\u201d",

            "text": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway sold off 10 million shares of Apple stock in the final three months of 2023, representing about 1% of its holdings in the company. The tech titan has become a major holding for the Oracle of Omaha\u2019s company and is known as one of the so-called \u201cfour giants\u201d \u2013 alongside its insurance, railroad and energy operations \u2013 that Buffett says drives most of Berkshire\u2019s value. But the Omaha-based conglomerate announced on Wednesday it had slightly trimmed its position in Apple in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The selloff is notable for Buffett, who is known to hold onto stocks for long periods of time. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t willing to own a stock for 10 years, don\u2019t even think about owning it for 10 minutes,\u201d he\u2019s said. Berkshire still owns more than 905 million shares of the company, worth about $174 billion. That represents 6% of all Apple shares and one-fifth of Berkshire\u2019s entire portfolio. Many investors, hoping to duplicate the success of Berkshire\u2019s portfolio, closely watch and often copy Buffett\u2019s market moves. Paring back This isn\u2019t the first time Berkshire, which began investing in Apple in 2016, has pared back some of its holdings in the tech company. In the second half of 2020, the company sold off about $11 billion worth of the stock, a move that Buffett, 93, later said was \u201cprobably a mistake,\u201d in a shareholder meeting. Buffett went on to praise Apple CEO Tim Cook as \u201cone of the best managers in the world\u201d and last year said that the company \u201cjust happens to be a better business than any we own.\u201d Berkshire Hathaway purchased an additional $31 billion in Apple shares in 2022. Shares of Apple fell by about 1.2% in morning trading on Thursday. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway were 0.7% higher. Troubles at Apple Apple reported earlier this month that sales grew year-on-year during the December quarter, following a streak of four consecutive quarters of revenue declines caused by slower device sales amid an uncertain economic environment. But while product sales have ticked up, revenue from the key China region slid, a sign of growing competition weighing on the iPhone maker. The company\u2019s stock is essentially flat from the start of this year. As it works to right the ship, Apple has taken a bold bet and rolled out its first new product in nearly a decade: the Vision Pro mixed reality headset. The device, which cost Apple billions in research and development, is being touted by the company as the future of computing, but for now, it remains a costly and clunky piece of hardware with limited uses. More to come Filings also showed that Berkshire sold 80 million shares of printer company HP in the fourth quarter of 2023, reducing its holdings by 78%. It also pared off 32% of its holdings in media company Paramount. Buffett\u2019s annual letter to shareholders is due out on February 24. It will be the first letter since his long-time business partner, Charlie Munger, died last November.",

            "text": "Paramount Global, the owner of broadcast and cable TV networks, announced Tuesday it will lay off\u00a0hundreds of staffers as the\u00a0media giant looks to reduce costs and grow revenue.\u00a0The news comes just days after its CBS network saw record-breaking advertising sales and the highest-rated telecast for the Super Bowl. The company\u2019s chief executive, Bob Bakish, announced\u00a0the layoffs\u00a0in a memo to employees Tuesday\u00a0obtained by CNN. While Bakish did not specify the number of layoffs,\u00a0sources\u00a0familiar with the matter\u00a0told CNN around 800 employees,\u00a0or roughly\u00a03% cut of the company\u2019s workforce,\u00a0will be affected. The announcement follows a January 25 memo in which Bakish warned that Paramount Global would \u201creduce our workforce globally\u201d as part of \u201cour path to earnings growth.\u201d The cuts will impact staffers around the world, with those in the\u00a0US\u00a0being notified by the end of business Tuesday,\u00a0Bakish wrote. \u201cThese adjustments will help enable us to build on our momentum and execute our strategic vision for the year ahead \u2014 and I firmly believe we have much to be excited about,\u201d Bakish wrote. Among those impacted by the layoffs were some of the highest-profile journalists at CBS News. Senior investigative correspondent Catherine Herridge and chief national affairs and justice correspondent Jeff Pegues were notified Tuesday that they were being laid off, two people familiar with the matter told CNN. It was not known when their last day at the network would be. A CBS News spokesperson did not comment. Herridge, who joined CBS News in 2019 from Fox News,\u00a0has been entangled\u00a0in a First Amendment lawsuit over her refusal to disclose her source(s) for a series of 2017 stories she reported on during her time at Fox News. Pegues joined CBS News in 2013, reporting on the network\u2019s broadcast platforms and hosted the podcast \u201cAmerica: Changed Forever.\u201d The layoffs come amid reports that Shari Redstone, the family heiress of Paramount\u2019s parent, National Amusements, has been in talks to sell her stake in the company. In recent months, David Zaslav, the chief executive of CNN parent Warner Bros. Discovery, met with Bakish and broached a potential merger between the two companies. David Ellison\u2019s Skydance and RedBird Capital\u00a0have also made takeover offers. Paramount declined to comment for this story. The media giant, which is attempting to transition its business from traditional linear television to streaming, announced Monday that CBS\u2019s broadcast of Super Bowl LVIII broke ratings records with a staggering 123.4 million viewers, marking the largest US TV audience since the 1969 moon landing. The network also broke\u00a0advertising sales records for the big game. \u201cWe set the high-water mark for ad sales for a Super Bowl, and it\u2019s looking like on Sunday we\u2019ll set an all-time viewing number with any luck,\u201d Bakish said Friday in a Bloomberg TV interview. Paramount is the latest media conglomerate to lay off staffers in 2024. In\u00a0January, the news industry saw cuts at The Los Angeles Times, TIME and Business Insider, while staffers at Cond\u00e9 Nast, Forbes and The New York Daily News staged historic walkouts to protest planned cuts.",

            "text": "Boeing, hit by quality concerns following the incident with a door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines flight early last month, reported that January was its worst month for new airplane orders since the height of the pandemic. The company announced Tuesday that it booked orders for only three jets, all 737 Max planes, to an unidentified customer. But it also had three 737 Max orders canceled, adding up to zero net orders for the period. The company last had three or fewer gross orders in June, 2020, when it had only one jet order. The last time that Boeing had zero or negative net orders was in January of 2021, when it had negative 1 net orders. The pandemic caused a temporary near halt in air travel and massive losses throughout the airline industry, which choked off demand for new jet orders. Boeing orders in the period were also hurt by a 20-month grounding of the 737 Max, its best selling model, following two fatal crashes of the jet that killed 346 people in late 2018 and early 2019. The very bad month for orders at Boeing followed 369 total net orders in December, a record month for the company, and a sign that its airline customers had recovered from the pandemic and were eager to add new aircraft to their fleets. That month capped the best year for orders for Boeing since before the 2019 grounding. The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the Alaska Air flight, said four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place were missing from the aircraft that was delivered by Boeing to Alaska just this past October. While the NTSB has not identified who was responsible for the missing bolts, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told investors earlier this month that no matter its findings, \u201cWe caused the problem.\u201d Earlier this month United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said the company is no longer counting on getting any of the 737 Max 10 models it has ordered in the foreseeable future. He described the Alaska Air incident as the \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\u201d in terms of its plans to take delivery of the new, longer Max model. And Southwest Airlines, another major Boeing customer, said it is no longer counting on deliveries it had planned for later this year of the 737 Max 7. Both models have yet to be certified to carry passengers by the Federal Aviation Administration, a process that could now be delayed by the Alaska Air incident. Uncertainty over that process, and a desire to see how the investigation by NTSB unfolds, could be among the reasons Boeing\u2019s orders came to a screeching halt in the month.",

            "text": "JetBlue\u2019s stock soared more than 14% in premarket trading Tuesday after financier Carl Icahn disclosed late Monday that he had taken a 9.9% stake in the company. Icahn paid an average of $3.56 a share for his 33.6 million shares of the stock, according to the filing. Shares of JetBlue closed Monday at $6.07 a share before leaping to nearly $7 a share in morning trading. The activist investor\u2019s filing said he has discussed, and intends to continue to discuss, the possibility of gaining a seat or multiple seats on the airline\u2019s board, and he said that he could buy additional shares. \u201cWe are always open to constructive dialogue with our investors as we continue to execute our plan to enhance value for all of our shareholders and stakeholders,\u201d said a statement from JetBlue following Icahn\u2019s filing. His purchases started on January 26, a week after a federal court blocked JetBlue\u2019s proposed purchase of Spirit Airlines. JetBlue and Spirit are appealing the decision, but JetBlue said in a filing last month that it believed it could still exit the deal because the court ruling had blocked it from closing by a deadline set in the merger agreement. Analysts had suggested that JetBlue was only interested in pursuing the deal, assuming it was allowed by the court, at a significantly lower price. JetBlue and Spirit both lost money in 2023 as larger airlines reported stronger profits. JetBlue said it had an adjusted loss of $151 million for 2023 and that with recent cost-cutting plans it would be \u201capproaching breakeven\u201d in 2024. It also recently announced changes among its top executive ranks. Some analysts have suggested that Spirit might not be able to survive without a merger. JetBlue had been interested in buying Spirit as a way of getting both the aircraft and pilots it needs to expand. It won a bidding war for Spirit waged against Frontier Airlines. Both Spirit and Frontier had been pioneers in the practice of having passengers pay an ultra-low base fare but then requiring extra for everything else, including carry-on baggage. The presence of Spirit has led the major airlines to offer cheaper \u201cbasic economy\u201d seats of their own on most flights. The proposed $3.8 billion deal would have created the nation\u2019s fifth-largest airline. JetBlue had argued it would allow greater competition with the four major US airlines \u2014 American Airlines, United, Delta and Southwest \u2014 which between them control about 80% of US air travel. But the US Justice Department argued, and the federal judge in the case agreed, that JetBlue buying Spirit would raise fares for passengers by removing Spirit from the marketplace.",

            "text": "It wasn\u2019t a great start of the year for aviation safety, with a runway collision at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport and a door plug blowing out in mid-air from an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 making headlines within days of each other, and with four more fatal accidents involving regional and business aircraft in the following weeks. Boeing, the maker of the 737, has been particularly under scrutiny once it emerged that the blowout was due to manufacturing problems, and some travelers are now actively choosing to avoid booking flights on Max 9 aircraft. Understandably, anxiety around flying is hitting a high \u2013 but is there any reason for concern? \u201cI don\u2019t believe that you should be worried,\u201d says Geoffrey Thomas, an aviation safety expert and editor in chief of Airline Ratings, which publishes an annual list of the safest airlines. \u201cCertainly Boeing has had some production problems, which they\u2019re working their way through, and it\u2019s not a good look. But the bottom line is that there are so many checks in place now that I don\u2019t believe anybody should be concerned. \u201cI would certainly not have any hesitation on getting on board a Boeing aircraft.\u201d The 737, Thomas adds, still has a better safety record than the 747. \u201cAnd nobody would ever hesitate to get on board a 747,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the things about aviation, as time goes by, is that manufacturers and airlines learn from their mistakes, and put systems in place to ensure they don\u2019t make them again. So statistically, over time, flying gets safer and safer and safer.\u201d In a recent analysis, Airline Ratings identified a list of aircraft that can be considered the safest to fly on, having never suffered any accident with fatalities. Among them are the Boeing 787 and 777-300ER, and the Airbus A220, A320neo and A380. The list of the world\u2019s safest airlines is topped by Air New Zealand, Qantas, Virgin Australia, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, Emirates, All Nippon Airways, Finnair and Cathay Pacific. Safer than driving \u201cAviation is the safest mode of transportation,\u201d says Anthony Brickhouse, a professor of aviation safety at Florida\u2019s Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. \u201cIf you look at the numbers, you\u2019re more at risk to have an accident driving to the airport than you are flying at 38,000 feet. I tell people, if you make it to your flight, the most hazardous part of your day is actually behind you.\u201d Passengers, Brickhouse adds, should pay less attention to exactly what aircraft they\u2019re flying on and focus on things they can control, like their personal safety when they get on board. \u201cFor example by paying attention during the safety briefing, and being aware of where emergency exits are, or not flying with children on their lap,\u201d he says. The US Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, Brickhouse notes, are investigating the Max 9 blowout and the fact that the aircraft is back in the air means they have completed whatever inspections were necessary to ensure it is as safe as possible. In the runway collision in Tokyo, a Japan Airlines Airbus A350 struck a Dash 8, a turboprop regional plane operated by the Tokyo Coast Guard, killing five of its six crew. Last year, a series of near-misses in US airports had prompted an investigation by the FAA. \u201cIf you have a certain trend that keeps occurring, unless you make pretty significant changes, that trend is unfortunately going to turn into an accident,\u201d says Brickhouse. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s really important that we\u2019ve been doing what we\u2019re doing, looking into all of these close calls in the airport environment, to learn as much as we can so that we can hopefully prevent that disaster that could be lurking. \u201cUnfortunately, with the Japan Airlines accident, we did lose five people on the military aircraft, but everybody made it off of the civilian aircraft. From a safety perspective, we can still learn what went right and what didn\u2019t.\u201d Following the accident, Japan modified some procedures relating to air traffic control, such as having staff constantly monitor ground radar systems that alert of possible runway collisions. However, this has prompted calls for a significant staff increase, as the measure is believed to put even more strain on the already stretched personnel. Close to zero The latest safety report from IATA, the trade association of the world\u2019s airlines, states that in 2022 there were a total of 39 commercial aviation accidents in the world, with 158 on-board fatalities \u2013 equalling one accident every 0.83 million flights. \u201cAccidents are rare in aviation,\u201d Willie Walsh, IATA\u2019s director general, said in a statement accompanying the report. \u201cThere were five fatal accidents among 32.2 million flights in 2022. That tells us that flying is among the safest activities in which a person can engage. But even though the risk of flying is exceptionally low, it is not risk-free. \u201cCareful analysis of the trends that are emerging even at these very high levels of safety is what will make flying even safer. This year\u2019s report, for example, tells us that we need to make some special efforts on turboprop operations in Africa and Latin America.\u201d IATA says that in the last 10 years, the industry has improved its overall safety performance by 48%. A study by Arnold Barnett, a professor of statistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, focuses exactly on aviation\u2019s ever-improving safety record. The study, which is yet to be published, is a follow-up to one he released in 2020, but looks at more recent flight data, until 2022. The main takeaway is that in the period between 2018 and 2022, the worldwide death risk per boarding was one in 13.4 million - that means that if you picked a flight completely at random and just took it, your chance of dying in a plane crash or a terrorist act was about one in 13 million. To put that in context, there\u2019s a much higher chance of being killed in a shark attack, or give birth to quadruplets, than die in a plane crash. That\u2019s also a significant improvement on the 2008 to 2017 period, where the risk was one in 7.9 million, and a dramatic drop compared to the 1968 to 1977 period, where the risk was one death every 350,000 boardings. \u201cIn the past half-century, we\u2019re now only about 1/38th as likely to die in a plane accident compared to the levels of the late 1960s and 1970s,\u201d Barnett says. Remote in probability However, sharing IATA\u2019s concerns, he warns that the world is not homogenous, and there are regions that suffer a higher rate of accidents, particularly developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. \u201cThey\u2019re down to one death every 2 million boardings right now, which is higher than the world average of one in 13 million,\u201d he adds. Conversely, in the countries where the study finds it safest to fly \u2013 including Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States \u2013 the risk drops to one death in around 80 million boardings. \u201cI know people who are afraid to fly and that\u2019s a very intense feeling for some of them, but I think that worrying about flying for the risk of death is similar to refusing to go into the supermarket because the ceiling could collapse,\u201d Barnett adds. When the risk gets sufficiently close to zero, we should effectively treat it as zero, Barnett says. \u201cI don\u2019t think every moment you\u2019re walking in the street, you assume death might be imminent because a meteor could suddenly hit you or something. These events are so remote in probability that we simply treat them as impossible. And I think flying, statistically, is in that category.\u201d",

            "text": "One year ago, a spectacular David and Goliath battle shook corporate India when a tiny American firm took on one of the world\u2019s richest infrastructure tycoons. Hindenburg Research published a\u00a0blistering report in January 2023, accusing Gautam Adani, then Asia\u2019s richest man, of engaging in fraud over decades. Hindenburg said it had taken a short position in his companies, meaning it would benefit if their shares fell. The Indian ports-to-power conglomerate denounced the short-seller\u2019s report as \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cmalicious.\u201d But that failed to halt a stunning stock market meltdown that, at one point, wiped more than $100 billion off the value of its listed companies. Adani\u2019s personal fortune was also hammered, collapsing by more than $80 billion in the month following the release of the report. A year on, Adani appears to have bounced back. Analysts are even saying the billionaire can give himself a pat on the back for the way he handled the crisis. \u201cThe group has done exceptionally well on various fronts since the Hindenburg report,\u201d said Manish Chowdhury, head of research at brokerage\u00a0StoxBox. \u201cIt is now better managed and they have learnt quickly from their mistakes and handled the media glare well.\u201d Shares in most of Adani\u2019s 10 listed firms have rallied this year, with some touching record highs recently. On Thursday, his wealth once again crossed the $100 billion threshold, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. An \u2018attack\u2019 on India Hindenburg Research, named after the 1937 airship disaster, had accused the Adani Group of \u201cbrazen stock manipulation\u201d and it questioned the \u201csky-high\u201d valuations of Adani firms. Their \u201csubstantial debt\u201d put the group \u201con a precarious financial footing.\u201d\u00a0 Adani Group responded with an angry rebuttal running to more than 400 pages, calling the analysis \u201cnothing but a lie\u201d and charging that the American firm\u2019s shorting of overseas-traded bonds and derivatives amounted to securities fraud. It also condemned the report as an \u201cattack\u201d on India. But it wasn\u2019t the first time analysts had questioned the group\u2019s aggressive debt-fuelled expansion spree into sectors ranging from airports to media. However, since the Hindenburg report, the group has worked on reducing its borrowing. Its net debt declined by 3.5% to $21.73 billion in the six months through September, according to a presentation it made to investors last year. It also attracted nearly $5 billion from new foreign investors, including US private equity firm GQG Partners. \u201cIn the fog of this war, our biggest weapon was adequate liquidity,\u201d Adani wrote in an opinion in the Times of India newspaper on January 25, exactly a year after the Hindenburg report was published. \u201cTo augment our strong cash reserves \u2026 we further fortified our financial position by raising an additional [400 billion rupees or $4.8 billion] equal to the debt repayment for the next two years, through stake sales in our group companies to investors of immaculate global standing, like GQG Partners and the QIA,\u201d he added. It also prepaid over $2 billion of margin-linked financing, a type of loan where promoters use their existing shares as security, which has \u201cinsulated and ring-fenced our portfolio from market volatility,\u201d the 61-year-old industrialist wrote. Back in the $100 billion club The conglomerate got another boost last month when\u00a0India\u2019s top court\u00a0ordered the market regulator to wrap up its investigation into the group quickly, saying no further probes were needed. And while, at $100 billion, Adani\u2019s personal fortune is still about $50 billion less than it was at its peak in 2022 \u2014 when he briefly ousted Jeff Bezos as the world\u2019s second richest person \u2014 it places him as the 12th richest man in the world, just behind fellow countryman Mukesh Ambani. A college dropout, Adani has at times been\u00a0compared\u00a0to business magnates\u00a0such as John D Rockefeller and Cornelius Vanderbilt, who built vast monopoly businesses in the 1800s during America\u2019s Gilded Age. He began his career with diamond trading before setting up a commodity trading business in 1988, which later evolved into Adani Enterprises, the group\u2019s flagship unit. He now has firms in sectors ranging from coal to clean energy. Concerns still remain. Critics say Adani\u2019s comeback rests heavily on crony capitalism, as he is seen as a close ally of Indian Prime Minister\u00a0Narendra Modi. But, for now, markets are betting on Adani\u2019s ability to grow his business in sectors that India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has prioritized for development. \u201cThe group is poised to do well in sectors that are important for India\u2019s economic future,\u201d said Chowdhury. \u201cMost of the issues raised by Hindenburg are on the back burner now.\u201d",

            "text": "Shares in Alibaba sank as much as 7% in Hong Kong on Thursday, after the Chinese tech giant reported disappointing sales figures and announced it would suspend listings plans for two of its units. Chairman Joseph Tsai said during an earnings call that \u201cgiven the challenging market conditions,\u201d the group was \u201cnot in a hurry\u201d about the timing of initial public offerings (IPO) for Cainiao, its logistics arm, and Freshippo, its grocery chain. \u201cMarket conditions currently are just not in a state where we believe we can really truly reflect the true intrinsic value of these businesses,\u201d he said. Alibaba said in September that it would spin off Cainiao in an IPO. Supermarket chain Freshippo\u2019s listing plans go back much further, to July 2022, according to Reuters. The news comes at a tough time for the tech giant. In December, the company reshuffled its top ranks after the stellar performance of a competitor\u00a0caused a stir\u00a0at Alibaba. Just weeks before, co-founder Jack Ma had called for \u201cchange\u201d at the company, after the dramatic success of rival PDD\u00a0(PDD), the group behind\u00a0Chinese online shopping giant Pinduoduo\u00a0and\u00a0US-based retail upstart Temu,\u00a0rattled\u00a0China\u2019s e-commerce industry. Ma, who co-founded Alibaba in 1999, urged employees to \u201cpay any price and sacrifice\u201d to help reform the company after PDD\u2019s performance caused nervousness. Alibaba\u2019s quarterly earnings, released on Wednesday, appeared to bear out this trend. Its sales of $36.7 billion in the quarter that ended in December, which was 5% higher than the same period a year before, was slightly below the expectations of a group of analysts polled by Refinitiv. Net income fell by 77% to just over $2 billion, which the company said was caused by a \u201cdecrease in income\u201d from its operations, it said in a statement. The company\u2019s announcement of a $25 billion share repurchase program, which it said demonstrated its confidence in its business and cash flow outlook, also failed to ignite interest among investors. Alibaba shares in New York closed 5.9% lower on Wednesday. \u201cWhile we [applaud] the proactive \u2026 approach to strengthen market position, with intensified competition and challenging macro headwinds, any possible share gains [will] likely take time,\u201d Citi analyst Alicia Yap wrote in a Thursday research report. In March 2023, Alibaba announced its biggest restructuring since Ma founded the company. It was split into six separate units, including cloud, e-commerce, logistics, media and entertainment \u2014 each overseen by its own CEO and board directors, and most of them with a mandate to pursue separate listings or fundraisings. Since then, its New York-listed shares have lost 25% of their value. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Laura He contributed reporting.",

            "text": "Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday said evidence shows four bolts that hold the door plug in place on the Boeing 737 Max 9 were missing at the time of last month\u2019s blowout on Alaska Airlines flight 1282. The new finding\u00a0from federal investigators comes one month and a day after the January 5 incident that triggered a 19-day emergency grounding of all Max 9s, and re-ignited scrutiny of Boeing following the fatal Max 8 crashes of 2018 and 2019. Boeing acknowledged its responsibility for the blowout in a statement issued after the NTSB report and said it is working to make sure incidents like this do not reoccur. \u201cWhatever final conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened,\u201d said Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun in a statement. \u201cAn event like this must not happen on an airplane that leaves our factory. We simply must do better for our customers and their passengers.\u201d Boeing said it was taking new actions to improve the way it makes the 737 Max 9 planes. That includes more inspections, giving the 737 teams more time \u201cto focus on and implement quality improvements,\u201d and bringing in outside safety experts to assess its operations. Evidence points to missing bolts In their 19-page preliminary report released Tuesday, NTSB investigators\u00a0included observations from a laboratory disassembly of Alaska 1282\u2019s door plug, which fell 16,000 feet into an Oregon backyard. It said the lack of damage to the plug where the bolts were supposed to attach it to the fuselage of the plane pointed to the conclusion that the bolts were missing at the time of the flight. \u201cOverall, the observed damage patterns and absence of contact damage or deformation around holes associated with the vertical movement arrestor bolts and upper guide track bolts in the upper guide fittings, hinge fittings, and recovered aft lower hinge guide fitting indicate that the four bolts that prevent upward movement of the MED plug were missing before the MED [mid exit door] plug moved upward off the stop pads,\u201d the report said referring to the mid exit door. The report included a photo taken in September, more than a month before the plane was delivered to Alaska Air, that show the bolts missing during work on the aircraft, taken from a text message between two Boeing employees obtained by NTSB investigators. It means that the plane flew for a couple of months before the January 5 blowout with the bolts missing. The report was only the preliminary finding and did not assess blame or cause of the incident. That could come in a final report that could be more than a year away. In a statement, the Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday: \u201cThis incident should have never happened and it cannot happen again. The FAA is continuing to support the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s investigation into the Jan. 5 door plug incident.\u201d The NTSB is in charge of the investigation and will provide any updates. A bigger problem than one incident The fact that no one was sitting in the seat next to the gaping hole that appeared in the side of the plane is a key reason there was not a fatality on the flight. Six crew and 171 passengers were on board the flight, which returned safely to Portland International Airport. Nobody was seriously hurt in the incident. The missing bolts are apparently not the only problem. Both Alaska Airlines and United Airlines said last month that inspections of their fleets that took place after the January 5 incident revealed loose bolts. \u201cThis is a somewhat complex issue with a lot of parts,\u201d NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told CNN in the week leading up to the release of the preliminary report. Even still, Homendy stressed that she \u201cwould have no problem getting on a Max 9 tomorrow and flying.\u201d Boeing\u2019s history of quality lapses The release of the report comes as Boeing\u2019s quality control is under intense scrutiny. During a House subcommittee hearing Tuesday, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said there are now two dozen FAA inspectors on location at Boeing\u2019s Renton, Washington plant as part of an agency audit. Late Sunday, Boeing disclosed that it would need to \u201crework\u201d improperly drilled holes discovered on 50 incomplete 737 Max planes still on the production line, causing a slowdown in deliveries. Later, Boeing fuselage contractor Spirit AeroSystems said it had caused that more recent problem. A Spirit spokesman said the company is working on \u201ccontinuous improvement.\u201d \u201cAs we review the NTSB\u2019s preliminary report, we remain focused on working closely with Boeing and our regulators on continuous improvement in our processes and meeting the highest standards of safety, quality and reliability,\u201d spokesman Joe Buccino said in a statement.  What happened onboard The report also details the shock of the blowout, which caught passengers and crew by surprise. \u201cThe captain said that, while climbing through about 16,000 ft, there was a loud bang,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe flight crew said their ears popped, and the captain said his head was pushed into the heads-up display (HUD) and his headset was pushed up, nearly falling off his head. The FO [first officer] said her headset was completely removed due to the rapid outflow of air from the flight deck.\u201d CNN has reported that NTSB investigators have been closely scrutinizing the door plug and whether crucial bolts that hold it in place were properly installed when the incident occurred. FAA is involved in the probe Meanwhile, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration told House lawmakers Tuesday that his agency is \u201cclosely scrutinizing\u201d Boeing after last month\u2019s door plug blowout. \u201cGoing forward, we will have more boots on the ground closely scrutinizing and monitoring production and manufacturing activities,\u201d FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker  said in prepared remarks. The Federal Aviation Administration failed to properly scrutinize Boeing after two fatal crashes of 737 Max aircraft killed 346 people more than four years ago, the agency\u2019s new chief said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there at the time as you noted. I guess I would say in retrospect and given what happened with the plug door, it\u2019s hard to call that oversight sufficient,\u201d Whitaker told Congress on Tuesday.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo, we\u2019re looking at that process and what additional steps need to be taken to make sure that oversight is sufficient.\u201d Whitaker was sworn in late last year and was not at the FAA at the time of those crashes in 2018 and 2019.\u00a0\u00a0He was previously the second-ranking FAA official from 2013 to 2016. Whitaker appeared before the House aviation subcommittee, his first congressional testimony since being confirmed to the post little more than three months ago. His agency is currently overhauling how it scrutinizes plane manufacturers, including Boeing, after a hole blew open in the side of a 737 Max 9 last month. \u201cI certainly agree that the current system is not working cause it is not delivering safe aircraft,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cWe have to make some changes to that. And I think we also have to look at the culture.\u201d This story has been updated to adjust the characterization of the report.",

The world\u2019s largest chipmaker will build a second semiconductor fabrication plant, or fab, in the country in \u201cresponse to rising customer demand,\u201d TSMC said in a statement Tuesday. Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing (JASM), a subsidiary majority-owned by TSMC, plans to start  construction by the end of 2024, it added. The facility is scheduled to be operational by the end of 2027. Together with JASM\u2019s first plant, which is scheduled to begin operation this year, the overall investment in Japan will exceed $20 billion \u201cwith strong support from the Japanese government,\u201d the statement said. Toyota Motor (TM) and Sony (SONY) have also invested in the venture. The plants will together create about 3,400 skilled jobs, according to TSMC. The increased production in Japan comes at a time when the chip maker is facing delays at its project in Arizona. The company had announced in 2022 that it would build a second semiconductor plant in the southwestern US state, adding to plans for an existing fab and raising its\u00a0overall investment\u00a0in Arizona from\u00a0$12 billion to $40 billion. The investment has previously been\u00a0lauded by US President Joe Biden\u00a0as a sign that US manufacturing \u201cis back.\u201d But earlier this year, TSMC said the facility will now be operational only in 2027 or 2028, compared to\u00a0previous expectations\u00a0of a 2026 start. TSMC, based in the Taiwanese city of Hsinchu, produces an estimated\u00a090% of the world\u2019s\u00a0super-advanced semiconductors and supplies to global tech giants such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA). It mass produces components that are vital to the running of everything from smartphones to washing machines. The company has typically kept its most advanced manufacturing at home in Taiwan, but it has been expanding abroad in recent years due to commercial pressure and encouragement from a number of governments. Last year, it\u00a0announced\u00a0a factory in Dresden, Germany, its first in Europe.",

But the continued quality and safety problems at Boeing, and at Spirit AeroSystems, caused the supplier to announce it would not give any outlook for profits the rest of the year. Still the return to profitability was a rare piece of good news for the company, which has been at the the center of the latest issues involving Boeing jets. Spirit made the fuselage for the Alaksa Airlines 737 Max 9 jet that had a door plug blow off the plane on a January 5 flight, causing a gaping hole in the side of the plane minutes into the trip. While the plane was able to land without any fatalities, examination of all the Max 9 jets in service discovered loose bolts on a number of planes, which is believed to have been the cause of the problem on the Alaska aircraft. Boeing announced on Sunday that Spirit AeroSystem workers disclosed there were misdrilled holes on 737 Max fuselages the company had built. The problem will force Boeing to re-work 50 of the jets before they are delivered, and further slow its production of the troubled jet. Boeing had planned to increase production of the 737 Max this year, but those plans have been put on hold by the Federal Aviation Administration as it examines the problems at both Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems. Because of that, Spirit AeroSystems said Tuesday it will not give guidance on 2024 results until it gets more details on Boeing\u2019s production plans, and it completes pricing negotiations with Airbus, another customer. In October, Spirit AeroSystems reached an agreement with Boeing in which it agreed to pay Spirit $455 million in additional payments between then and 2025, in addition to at least $100 million to pay for additional tooling it needed. Boeing and Spirit described the agreement as a way to have \u201cimproved quality and higher deliveries in the future\u201d from Spirit. Because of that agreement, Spirit reported net income of $59 million for the quarter, a large improvement from the net loss of $243 million a year earlier. The adjusted profit of 48 cents a share was the first adjusted income since the first quarter of 2022. It still left Spirit with a net loss for the year of $633 million, but it was the best quarterly result for the supplier since 2019. Spirit has reported net losses every quarter since the start of the pandemic in early 2020. The pandemic caused a massive slowdown in jet demand from airlines worldwide, and caused Boeing to temporarily halt production of the 737 Max, which it had continued to build during a 20-month grounding of the jet following two fatal crashes.",

            "title": "Virgin Galactic grounded after a small part fell off vehicle during latest space tourism flight",
            "text": "Virgin Galactic is grounded after the company said a small part unintentionally detached from the mothership of its rocket-powered space plane on its latest space tourism flight. The loss of the part, called an alignment pin, did not impact the safety of the mission, according to the company. The flight, called Galactic 06, launched on January 26 and marked Virgin Galactic\u2019s first space tourism mission of the year after entering commercial service in 2023. The company discovered the part loss during routine checks and notified government regulators on January 31, \u201cin accordance with regulations,\u201d Virgin Galactic said in a statement. The pin was located on the underbelly of Virgin Galactic\u2019s mothership, called VMS Eve, which is a twin-fuselage plane designed to carry the space plane, VMS Unity, under its wings to a high altitude before VMS Unity is released and vaults toward the edge of space. The alignment pin \u201chelps ensure the spaceship is aligned to the mothership when mating the vehicles on the ground during pre-flight procedures,\u201d the company said in a Monday statement. The pin also helps transfer \u201cdrag and other forces\u201d from the space plane to the support structure that cradles the rocket-powered plane as it rides attached to the VMS Eve mothership, according to the company. Virgin Galactic said it will work alongside the Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, on a review of the issue. The FAA said in a statement that it will carry out a \u201cmishap investigation\u201d and that the agency \u201cmust approve Virgin Galactic\u2019s final report, including the corrective actions\u201d before the company can return to flight.\u202f\u00a0\u201cA return to flight is based on the FAA determining that any system, process, or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety,\u201d according to a statement from the agency. \u201cIn addition, Virgin Galactic must request and receive approval from the FAA to modify its\u00a0license\u00a0that incorporates the corrective actions and meets all other licensing requirements.\u201d Virgin Galactic could not be immediately reached for additional comment Monday evening. Flight expectations Broader attachment structures remained in place during the flight, Virgin Galactic added in the statement, noting that the alignment pin does \u201cnot support the spaceship\u2019s weight, nor do they have an active function once the spaceship is released.\u201d The VMS Unity usually flies affixed to the VMS Eve mothership until it is soaring more than 45,000 feet (13,700 meters) above Earth\u2019s surface. Once at altitude, the VMS Unity detaches from the mothership and ignites its rocket engine, swooping upward toward the edge of the atmosphere. Overall, the Galactic 06 mission \u201cwas a safe and successful flight that was conducted in accordance with Virgin Galactic\u2019s rigorous flight procedures and protocols,\u201d the company said. \u201cVirgin Galactic flights occur in restricted airspace and at specific geographical launch locations that control the hazards to people or structures on the ground,\u201d Virgin Galactic\u2019s statement reads. \u201cThe Company also observed no damage to the spaceship or the mothership.\u201d The FAA is tasked with giving the final go-ahead for commercial companies hoping to launch rockets and spacecraft. The agency\u2019s role in this process, however, is only to analyze the potential risk that a flight poses to the public, people or property \u2014 not the danger to passengers on board commercial space vehicles, according to a moratorium set to expire in March 2024. The FAA routinely carries out mishap investigations with private companies after a flight failure or other issue during a commercial rocket launch. Virgin Galactic said it will \u201cprovide a further update at the completion of the (joint FAA) review and will confirm the flight window for the \u2018Galactic 07\u2019 mission, which is planned for the second quarter of 2024.\u201d",

The revelations by the Journal come less than a week after a Delaware Chancery Court judge struck down Musk\u2019s unprecedented, multibillion-dollar pay package, calling the board\u2019s approval process \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d because of how many people involved were \u201cbeholden\u201d to Musk, and bringing renewed scrutiny to his deep relationships with ostensibly independent board members. Throughout her ruling, Judge Kathaleen McCormick noted that the people who were supposed to negotiate Musk\u2019s pay on Tesla\u2019s behalf were, in fact, far from independent. Musk has extensive ties with board members, including Ira Ehrenpreis, who personally and through his business has invested \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d in Musk-controlled companies. Ehrenpreis is also a close friend to Kimbal Musk, Elon\u2019s brother, who is also a Tesla board member. Ehrenpreis attended Kimbal\u2019s wedding in Spain, and also invested in Kimbal\u2019s restaurant company, The Kitchen Group. Another member of the compensation committee, Antonio Gracias, has both business and personal ties with the CEO. McCormick noted that Gracias and Musk had spent Christmas together, and even vacationed with Musk\u2019s family \u201con a regular basis,\u201d taking numerous vacations with Musk\u2019s cousins, as well. The relationship is not strictly limited to vacations, however, with Gracias having acquired \u201cdynastic or generational wealth\u201d from having invested in Musk\u2019s companies. In another instance, the judge emphasized the role of Tesla\u2019s general counsel Todd Maron \u2014 who was previously Musk\u2019s divorce lawyer \u2014 in advising Tesla\u2019s board and compensation committee. Maron was \u201ctotally beholden to Musk,\u201d McCormick wrote in her ruling last week, adding that Maron\u2019s admiration for Musk \u201cmoved him to tears\u201d during both his deposition and in trial testimony. Maron\u2019s team prepared \u201can aggressive timeline for approving a compensation plan,\u201d McCormick wrote in her more than 200-page ruling.\u00a0The break-neck speed of the process \u201creflected a reckless approach to a fiduciary process.\u201d Robyn Denholm, the Tesla board chair, doesn\u2019t appear to have had any personal relationship with Musk outside of her service on the board, McCormick wrote. Though the vast majority of Denholm\u2019s wealth \u2014 including what Denholm called a \u201clife-changing\u201d $280 million sale of Tesla options \u2014 came from her position as a board member. The Journal notes that the Nasdaq exchange, where Tesla trades, requires that an independent director can\u2019t be an employee, a family member or someone whose relationship \u201cwould interfere with the exercise of independent judgment.\u201d Tesla didn\u2019t immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Tesla\u2019s stock is down nearly 30% so far this year. Shares took a beating last month after Tesla leadership told investors on an earnings call that sales growth this year \u201cmay be notably lower,\u201d and that Musk believed Chinese carmakers, absent trade barriers, \u201cwill pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.\u201d Monday\u2019s selloff was also tied to a decision by the brokerage Piper Sandler to cut its Tesla stock price target. The firm said it now expects deliveries this year to come in below 2 million, suggesting Tesla\u2019s growth would be flat. \u201cThe crony non-independent board stories are not new,\u201d longtime Tesla critic Gordon Johnson, CEO of GLJ Research, told CNN. \u201cThe big problem for Tesla, is that the underlying growth and margin story for their business is imploding.\u201d The Journal story, coming on the heels of the Delaware ruling, \u201cgives wealth managers a reason to exit,\u201d Johnson added. \u201cThis idea that [Tesla] is a tech company that does better than the rest of the auto industry has been thoroughly debunked \u2026 I think that the market is coming to that realization more every day, and Elon Musk\u2019s shenanigans are helping the market to increasingly come to that conclusion.\u201d",

            "title": "New problem found on Boeing 737 Max planes",
            "text": "A new problem has been found during the production of 737 Max jets that will force Boeing to rework about 50 planes that have not yet been delivered. The problem was disclosed in a memo sent to Boeing (BA) employees Sunday by Stan Deal, the head of the company\u2019s commercial aircraft unit. An employee at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which makes the fuselages of the 737 Max jets, notified the plane maker that two holes may not have been drilled exactly to Boeing\u2019s requirements, according to Deal\u2019s memo. \u201cWhile this potential condition is not an immediate flight safety issue and all 737\u2019s can continue operating safely, we currently believe we will have to perform rework on about 50 undelivered airplanes,\u201d it said. Spirit AeroSystems confirmed in a statement that it mis-drilled the holes. \u201cA member of our team identified an issue that does not conform to engineering standards,\u201d Spirit AeroSystems spokesman Joe Buccino said. \u201cOnce notified, we began immediate actions to identify and implement appropriate repair solutions. We are in close communication with Boeing on this matter.\u201d The news about the mis-drilled holes is just the latest blow to Boeing\u2019s reputation, which has been battered repeatedly over the last five years, most recently by a\u00a0terrifying accident\u00a0aboard a 737 Max 9 flight on January 5. And in the wake of that incident, the FAA now says it will be changing the way it oversees Boeing\u2019s manufacturing processes. An Alaska Airlines flight had a door plug blow out that day, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. While the exact cause of the incident is not yet known, Boeing CEO David Calhoun told investors on Wednesday: \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that.\u201d \u201cWhatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe simply must be better.\u201d Deal\u2019s Sunday memo said Boeing\u2019s 737 Max factory in Renton, Washington would \u201cdedicate several days \u2026 this week to focus on this important work, reflecting the premium we place on quality, safety and, ultimately, stability in our factories.\u201d Quality problems In a cost-cutting move, Boeing has been increasingly depending on suppliers in recent years to assemble key parts of its aircraft. Spirit AeroSystems, for example, builds its fuselages and in some cases its cockpits, leaving Boeing with only final assembly of the planes that carry its name. But this is not the only supplier delivering products to Boeing that does not meet its standards, according to Deal. He also acknowledged there are problems with planes at Boeing\u2019s own production facilities. During a recent day on which Boeing halted production of the 737 Max to hold a staff meeting to stress the importance of quality control, \u201cmany employees voiced frustration with \u2026 how unfinished jobs \u2013 either from our suppliers or within our factories \u2013 can ripple through the production line,\u201d Deal wrote in the memo. \u201cThese employees are absolutely right. We need to perform jobs at their assigned position,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to maintain this discipline within our four walls and we are going to hold our suppliers to the same standard.\u201d \u201cWe recently instructed a major supplier to hold shipments until all jobs have been completed to specification,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile this delay in shipment will affect our production schedule, it will improve overall quality and stability.\u201d Boeing has halted delivery on a number of occasions over the last few years involving both the Max and the 787 Dreamliner because the planes had not been built according to specifications. The suspensions caused problems for airline customers that had been counting on the planes and also led to ongoing losses at Boeing. The company reported last week that it lost $2.2 billion in 2023, bringing losses over the last five years to $26.7 billion. Two major customers, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines, said last month they were no longer counting on receiving their orders of new versions of the 737 Max they had been promised by Boeing. Southwest had been expecting the 737 Max 7, while United had ordered the Max 10. Neither plane has been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration to carry passengers. United CEO Scott Kirby said the incident on the Alaska Air flight was the \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\u201d in terms of the airline moving forward with plans to take deliveries of the Max 10 later this year as previously planned. The most serious problem for Boeing was a design flaw in the 737 Max that led to two fatal crashes, one in October 2018 and one in March 2019, that killed a total of 346 people and led to a 20-month grounding of the aircraft. \u2018Re-imagined oversight\u2019 The mis-drilled holes are on the planes\u2019 window frames, Jodi Baker, a FAA official in its aviation safety office, told reporters on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ll ensure that those airplanes meet all safety standards before we can approve them for delivery,\u201d she said. The FAA has started developing a plan for \u201cre-imagined oversight\u201d and is asking how it \u201ccan do this job differently going forward,\u201d said Baker.\u00a0\u00a0She said the plan will extend to all US aircraft manufacturers \u2013 although Boeing is the largest US plane maker and\u00a0has\u00a0experienced a series of quality lapses in recent years. \u201cWe want to step up more interaction and more direct observation of the work that\u2019s being accomplished,\u201d she said. \u201cSurveillance is that boots on the floor.\u201d Agency officials are currently determining how they would conduct this work, and Baker said in the meantime\u00a0they\u00a0are performing \u201cnose to tail, wingtip to wingtip\u201d inspections of work on Boeing\u2019s 737 Max assembly line in Renton, Washington. Baker said that nearly all of the 737 Max 9s grounded in the wake of the January 5 incident aboard an Alaska Airlines-operated flight are back in the air.\u00a0 There are eight Max 9s still parked at Alaska Airlines and one parked at United Airlines, she said.",

            "text": "Tim Clark, the president of Emirates, has joined a chorus of airline executives in warning that Boeing is running out of time to restore its reputation following a series of safety and manufacturing blunders. In an interview with the Financial Times published Sunday, Clark said he had seen a \u201cprogressive decline\u201d in Boeing\u2019s standards, which he put down to long-running management and governance missteps, including prioritizing profit over engineering excellence. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to get their manufacturing processes under review so there are no corners cut etc. I\u2019m sure Dave Calhoun and Stan Deal are on that,\u201d he added, referring to Boeing\u2019s CEO and head of commercial airplanes respectively. \u201cThis is the last chance saloon.\u201d Emirates declined to comment further. Clark isn\u2019t the first airline boss to criticize Boeing since part of the fuselage of a 737 Max 9 blew out mid-flight in early January. In an interview with CNBC last month, United CEO Scott Kirby lamented the planemaker\u2019s \u201cconsistent manufacturing challenges.\u201d \u201cI think the Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build a plan that doesn\u2019t have the Max 10 in it,\u201d he added, referring to Boeing\u2019s newer, larger 737 model. The CEOs of American and Alaska have also voiced their frustration. But Clark is one of the most high-profile figures in aviation, having held senior roles at Emirates since the 1980s, and the Dubai-based airline is one of Boeing\u2019s biggest customers. In November, Emirates placed an order for 95 wide-body Boeing 777 and 787 jets, used for long-haul flights, valued at $52 billion in total. The US aviation regulator is already investigating the beleaguered planemaker\u2019s manufacturing practices after January\u2019s incident in which a so-called door plug shot out only a few minutes into an Alaska Airlines flight, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing. The blowout added to a string of quality and safety issues with Boeing planes in recent years. Two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in October 2018 and March 2019 respectively, which killed 346 people, led to the long-term grounding of some Boeing jets and delayed deliveries of others. Unlike after those fatal crashes, Boeing has been quick to accept responsibility for the Alaska Airlines incident and pledged to do better.  Still, Clark said that Emirates would, for the first time, send its own engineers to observe the production process of the 777 at Boeing and its supplier Spirit AeroSystems. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re having to do that is testament to what has happened,\u201d he told the Financial Times. Boeing \u201cneeds a root-and-branch look at how it goes about producing aeroplanes,\u201d he added. \u201cWill Boeing restore itself to its former glory? Of course it will. Will Boeing continue to produce and design great aeroplanes, well-put together, reliable, for the customer base? I\u2019m sure they will. But they\u2019ve got to put the house in order at the moment. And this is a major shift in the priorities.\u201d When contacted for comment, Boeing referred CNN to Calhoun\u2019s remarks to analysts on an earnings call last week in which he said that increased scrutiny from regulators and customers \u201cwill make us better.\u201d \u201cWe will go slow to go fast and we will encourage and reward employees for speaking up to slow things down if that\u2019s what\u2019s needed,\u201d he added. Ryanair \u2014 Europe\u2019s largest airline and another of Boeing\u2019s biggest customers \u2014 said last week that it was putting more of its own engineers in factories that build Boeing planes to run extra checks. CEO Michael O\u2019Leary said he has \u201ca lot of confidence\u201d in Calhoun and chief financial officer Brian West to turn the company around.

            "text": "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos plans to sell up to 50 million shares of Amazon stock over the next year, according to a regulatory filing posted on Friday. Those shares would be worth nearly $8.6 billion at the stock\u2019s current price. Bezos\u2019 planned stock sale was included in Amazon\u2019s annual report published on Friday due to a Securities and Exchange Commission rule requiring such disclosures. The news also comes a day after the company reported a record holiday shopping quarter, sending shares for Amazon climbing by some 8% on Friday. Bezos, 60, stepped down as CEO of the company he founded in 2021, but he still serves as chair of the board at Amazon. Since stepping away from his daily duties at the helm of the e-commerce leader, Bezos has made headlines mostly for his colorful fashion choices, relationship with fianc\u00e9 Lauren Sanchez and space-faring ambitions via his private company Blue Origin. The annual report said that Bezos adopted a trading plan to sell up to 50 million shares of Amazon stock over a period ending on January 31, 2025, subject to certain conditions. It would appear now is a good time for Bezos to sell. Amazon shares tumbled in 2022 amid a whiplash in pandemic-induced demand for e-commerce and broader macroeconomic uncertainty. Current CEO Andy Jassy has since embarked on aggressive cost-cutting measures, including multiple rounds of mass layoffs that have put tens of thousands of workers out of jobs. Some of the layoffs have continued into this year. But Amazon\u2019s stock has since rallied sharply, climbing roughly 90% since falling to $84 a share in\u00a0December\u00a02022. Moreover, Bezos\u2019 recent move to Florida from Washington state would mean he could avoid state capital gains taxes on the stock sale. Florida currently does not have a capital gains tax. Bezos\u2019 home state of Washington upheld a capital gains tax measure last year, according to the Seattle Times.",

            "text": "After losing her house to a fire, Jo Ann Ussery had a peculiar idea: to live in an airplane.  She bought an old Boeing 727 that was destined for the scrapyard, had it shipped to a plot of land she already owned, and spent six months renovating, doing most of the work by herself. By the end, she had a fully functional home, with over 1,500 square feet of living space, three bedrooms, two bathrooms and even a hot tub \u2013 where the cockpit used to be. All for less than $30,000, or about $60,000 in today\u2019s money. Ussery \u2013 a beautician from Benoit, Mississippi \u2013 had no professional connection to aviation, and was following the offbeat suggestion of her brother-in-law, an air traffic controller. She lived in the plane from 1995 to 1999, when it was irreparably damaged after falling off the truck that was moving it to a different location nearby, where it would have been open for public display.  Although she wasn\u2019t the first person to ever live in an airplane, her flawless execution of the project had an inspirational effect. In the late 1990s, Bruce Campbell, an electrical engineer with a private pilot license, was awestruck by her story: \u201cI was driving home and listening to [the radio,] and they had Jo Ann\u2019s story, and it was amazing I didn\u2019t drive off the road because my focus turned entirely to it. And the next morning I was placing phone calls,\u201d he says. A 727 in the woods Campbell has now been living in his own plane \u2013 also a Boeing 727 \u2013 for over 20 years, in the woods of Hillsboro, Oregon: \u201cI still stand on Jo Ann\u2019s shoulder and I\u2019m grateful for the proof of concept.\u201d He has no regrets: \u201cI would never live in a conventional home. No chance. If Scotty beamed me to inner Mongolia, erased my fingerprints and forced me to live in a conventional structure, I\u2019d do what I have to do to survive \u2013 but otherwise, it\u2019s a jetliner for me anytime.\u201d That\u2019s not to say he wouldn\u2019t do anything differently: \u201cI made a lot of mistakes, including the whopper-class one: partnering with a salvage firm. Avoiding that and using superior transport logistics renders the costs much lower,\u201d he explains.  His project cost $220,000 in total (about $380,000 in today\u2019s money), of which roughly half was for the purchase of the plane. He says the plane belonged to Olympic Airways in Greece and was even used to transport the remains of the airline\u2019s magnate owner, Aristotle Onassis, in 1975: \u201cI didn\u2019t know the plane\u2019s history at the time. And I didn\u2019t know that it had an old, 707-style interior. It was really, really awful compared to modern standards. It was functional but it just looked old and crude. Maybe the worst choice for a home.\u201d As a result, Campbell had to work on the plane for a couple of years before being able to live in it. The interiors are no-frills, with a primitive shower made out of a plastic cylinder and a futon sofa for a bed. During the harshest part of winter Campbell traditionally retreats to Miyazaki, a city in southern Japan with subtropical weather where he owns a small apartment. But the pandemic has made this difficult, and for the past three years he\u2019s been living in the 727 year-round. Intending to set up an airplane home in Japan as well, in 2018 he says he almost bought a second aircraft \u2013 a 747-400 \u2013 but the deal fell out at the last minute, because the airline (which Campbell won\u2019t reveal) decided to keep the aircraft in service for longer than expected: \u201cWe had to put the project on hold and it stands that way to this day,\u201d he says. Campbell frequently gets visitors and even offers lodging in the aircraft free of charge, while in the summer he hosts larger public events with funfair attractions: \u201cArtists perform on the right wing, guests dance in front or behind the wing in the forest, which for the big concerts becomes filled with all sorts of recreational venues. They\u2019re not Disneyland class \u2013 just portable booths with different curiosities and little recreations, but they\u2019re fun.\u201d  Double fuselage If you think living in an airplane is extravagant enough, how about living in two? That\u2019s the plan for Joe Axline, who owns an MD-80 and DC-9, sitting next to each other in a plot of land in Brookshire, Texas. Axline has lived in the MD-80 for over a decade \u2013 after getting divorced on April Fool\u2019s Day in 2011 \u2013 and is planning to renovate the DC-8 and equip it with recreational areas such as a movie theater and a music room. He calls his grand plan \u201cProject Freedom.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got less than a quarter of a million dollars in the whole project,\u201d says Axline, who has very few running expenses because he owns the land and has built his own water well and sewer system: \u201cThe only thing that I have still left is electricity,\u201d he adds. For years, he even shared the plane with his children: \u201cThe kids are gone now, so it\u2019s just me. Living in a house, you have a lot of space, but it\u2019s all wasted space. My master bedroom is 10 feet by 18, which is not a bad size for a bedroom. I\u2019ve got two TVs in it, plenty of space to walk around. My living room is good-sized, the dining room seats four, I can cook enough food for a whole bunch of people if they come over. I also have a shower and a toilet, so I don\u2019t have to get out of the airplane to go to the restroom. The only thing that I don\u2019t have here that I would have in a house is windows that open,\u201d he explains, adding that he just opens the plane\u2019s doors to let fresh air in. The planes are visible from nearby roads, and Axline says that many drivers \u2013 their curiosity piqued \u2013 end up stopping by: \u201cI have three or four people every single day. I call them my turistas,\u201d he says. \u201cThey drive by and think, it\u2019s so cool. Most of the time I wave them all over. I\u2019ll say, if you got some time, I\u2019ll give you a tour. And if I didn\u2019t make the bed that day, who cares? Let\u2019s see how real people live.\u201d Axline too was interested in a Boeing 747 \u2013 living in the \u201cQueen of the Skies\u201d is the airplane homeowner\u2019s ultimate dream \u2013 but he gave up when he was confronted with the shipping costs: \u201cThe airplane itself was about $300,000, but the shipping cost was $500,000. Half a million dollars to move it. That\u2019s because you can\u2019t drive it through the roads, you\u2019d have to tear it apart, cut it up, slice it and dice it and then put it back together.\u201d  Airplane DIY There are other notable examples of airplanes converted to homes. One of the earliest is a Boeing 307 Stratoliner once owned by billionaire and film director Howard Hughes, who spent a fortune remodeling the interior to turn it into a \u201cFlying Penthouse.\u201d After being damaged by a hurricane, it was turned into an extravagant motoryacht and eventually purchased in the 1980s by Florida resident Dave Drimmer, who extensively renovated it and renamed it \u201cThe Cosmic Muffin.\u201d He lived in the plane-boat hybrid for 20 years, before eventually donating it to the Florida Air Museum in 2018. American country singer and Nashville Hall of Famer Red Lane, who had a past as a plane mechanic, lived for decades in a converted DC-8 that he saved from the scrapyard in the late 1970s. Lane, who passed away in 2015, also had no regrets: \u201cI have never, ever woke up in this place wishing I was somewhere else,\u201d he revealed in a 2006 TV interview. Those who want to experience a night or two in an airplane home have a few options in the form of hotels; in Costa Rica, the Costa Verde hotel boasts a fully refurbished Boeing 727 \u2013 complete with two bedrooms and an ocean view terrace; in Sweden, Jumbo Stay is a hotel built entirely inside a Boeing 747, sitting on the grounds of Stockholm\u2019s Arlanda Airport. And if you\u2019re just looking to party, there\u2019s another Boeing 747 that can be hired for events with up to 220 people, at Cotswold Airport in England, about 100 miles west of London. If you want to leave transitional housing behind and fully take to life inside a fuselage, however, you must be ready for challenges: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a passion for wanting to do this, because there\u2019ll be so many problems that you\u2019ll need to address that it can become overwhelming,\u201d says Joe Axline, who lists sourcing the right airframe and finding a suitable location for it among the biggest hurdles.  That is perhaps why several of Bruce Campbell\u2019s visitors over the years expressed interest in adopting this lifestyle, but none ever turned the dream into reality: \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty difficult for people: a few of my guests left convinced they wanted to do it and I sent them articulated instructions to help them along step by step, but none have established momentum,\u201d he says. But don\u2019t let that discourage you, Campbell adds: \u201cMy primary advice is do it. Don\u2019t let anybody shake your confidence. Work out all the logistics, and just do it.\u201d",

            "text": "Part of the fuselage blowing off shortly after takeoff, leaving a gaping hole in the plane, and\u00a0phones and clothing ripped\u00a0away from terrified passengers. Investigations revealing sloppy work, including\u00a0loose or missing bolts, instances of tools, trash and even\u00a0empty tequila bottles\u00a0left inside planes built for government clients.\u00a0Worldwide groundings. Halts to deliveries due to quality issues. And, by far, the most serious problem -\u00a0two fatal crashes\u00a0leaving 346 people dead. Boeing is back in the headlines for all the wrong reasons again after the Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 incident. The National Safety Transportation Board, which is investigating, is expected to release its preliminary findings soon. That\u2019s the Boeing of today and the last five years. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that Boeing\u2019s reputation was that of a staid industrial giant, known for building the safest, most advanced planes in the sky. It helped introduce the world to commercial jet travel. Pilots and others in the industry, as well as members of the flying public, summed up their confidence in the company with the expression, \u201cIf it\u2019s not Boeing, I\u2019m not going.\u201d The company still sells\u00a0coffee cups\u00a0and\u00a0t-shirts\u00a0with that slogan. So how in the world did the company whose brand was once synonymous with safety become mired in reputational disaster \u2013 to the point where at least one travel site has a feature that allows passengers to avoid Boeing 737 Max planes altogether. Experts and critics say that Boeing\u2019s woes have been years in the making, some pointing to the result of a shift in corporate culture that started at the top and put profits ahead of the safety and engineering prowess for which it was once praised, placing not only its future, but the passengers on its planes, at grave risk. While Boeing denies there has been such a shift away from safety and excellence, what is indisputable is that its engineering and manufacturing problems have contributed to a series of shocking incidents, two of which resulted in the deaths more than 300 people combined. Boeing simultaneously became a financial basket case, reporting cumulative net losses of more than $26 billion, and counting, over the last five years, with no end to the red ink in sight. Boeing executives insist that quality and safety are still a top priority for the company, and the problems of recent years have only increased its focus on quality and safety. Asked for comment on the claim that it now puts profits ahead of quality and safety, the company pointed to a recent statement by CEO Dave Calhoun. \u201cOver the last several years, we\u2019ve added rigor around our quality processes, hired tens of thousands of engineers and mechanics, advanced key investments in our future, transformed our functions and gradually increased our production rates,\u201d he told investors in October. \u201cMost importantly, we\u2019ve worked hard to instill a culture of speaking up and transparently bringing forward any issue, no matter the size, so we can get things right for the future.\u201d A week after Calhoun made the remark, the company delivered a 737 Max 9 to Alaska Air, the fourth it had built for the carrier that month. Code letters N704AL, the jet\u2019s door plug blew out while the plane was mid-air, less than 10 weeks after it was delivered, just minutes into the January 5 flight. The company also pointed to what it called a \u201cquality stand down,\u201d on Thursday for its 737 factory teams in Renton, Washington in which it halted production to focus on quality issues. Boeing announced the move in the wake of a recently expanded federal probe into the company\u2019s manufacturing practices following the Alaska Air incident and plans for Congressional hearings into its practices. The first 737 Max 9 planes that were grounded after that incident returned to service on Friday, and most are expected to be back in the air by the end of this week. \u201cOur long-term focus is on improving our quality so that we can regain the confidence of our customers, our regulator and the flying public. Frankly, we have disappointed and let them down,\u201d said a statement by Stan Deal, the head of Boeing\u2019s commercial airplane unit, in a statement to employees following that return to service. \u201cOver the last century, the people of Boeing have faced and overcome significant challenges. This is one of those times. We have to be better. We have to deliver perfect airplanes each and every time.\u201d But critics say this crisis is unlike any earlier problems at the company, arguing that despite Boeing\u2019s assurances, they believe there has been a cultural change within the company in the last 25 years that has put profits over safety and quality. \u201cLeadership is more concerned with\u00a0getting the planes out the door than quality,\u201d Ed Pierson, a former Boeing executive who is now the executive director of the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a public interest group, told CNN last week. He said planes are still being produced today with flaws not being caught. \u2018Everything had to be cost justified\u2019 The spark for the conflagration that has recently consumed Boeing might date back decades. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the huge American defense contractors began to consolidate. Fearful of their own survival without a communist enemy stalking NATO\u2019s borders\u00a0they\u00a0began to merge with one another. In the decade after the end of the Cold War, 51 major American defense and aerospace contractors\u00a0became just five huge companies. And one of the five left standing was Boeing, newly merged in 1997 with competitor McDonell Douglas. Critics said that before the merger, Boeing had a reputation as a company run by people with engineering backgrounds who cared about quality and safety first. But those critics say the merger put the company in the hands of executives with a finance background, who put profits as their top goal. \u201cBoeing had a reputation before the merger of a company where engineers were high church,\u201d Ron Epstein, an\u00a0aerospace analyst at Bank of America, told CNN. It resulted in Boeing not being as profitable as some comparable manufacturers, he said. But after the merger he said, \u201ceverything had to be cost-justified.\u201d On paper, Boeing was the company that bought McDonnell Douglas. But many of the leadership ranks became filled with McDonnell Douglas veterans, not Boeing executives. Many of them had financial backgrounds, not the engineering backgrounds of those who had run Boeing in the past. Or they came from outside of the company, such as from General Electric, where cost-cutting and improved efficiency was a near religion. One of those was Jim McNerney, who became Boeing CEO in 2005, after a career that started at consumer products maker Procter & Gamble, included time at management consultant McKinsey & Co., and was followed by years at GE. He was CEO of 3M before being tapped to run Boeing, without any engineering and limited aerospace experience. Moving away from its roots, saving cash Under this leadership the company moved away, figuratively and literally, from its Pacific Northwest roots, where top executives had been intimately familiar with the massive assembly lines there where commercial jets were built, and any problems that might be developing there. In 2001 it moved its headquarters to Chicago. And in the midst of various crises in recent years, it moved its headquarters again in 2022,\u00a0not back to Seattle, but to a\u00a0suburb of Washington, DC,\u00a0near the Pentagon, Capitol Hill, and its various regulators, like the FAA. Ironically the move to Washington came the same week Airbus\u00a0revealed that it was increasing production of commercial jets at its factory in\u00a0Mobile, Alabama, only seeming to drive home the point to critics that Boeing was moving in the wrong direction. \u201cOne company is saying \u2018We\u2019re going to build lots of jets.\u2019 The other is saying \u2018We\u2019re going to lobby the Pentagon and Congress for defense dollars.\u2019 It\u2019s a big contrast,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory and a leading aerospace analyst. Boeing became more dependent on suppliers to build more and more of its planes, seeking to limit its role to joining together the parts. And it spun-off some of the operations it had depended upon previously. Supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which builds the fuselages for Boeing\u2019s planes, including the 737 Max, was created in 2005 after Boeing sold its Wichita division and Oklahoma operations raising $900 million in cash by doing so. And in 2009, about a year after weathering a 58-day strike at its unionized plants in Washington state, the company announced plans for a non-union plant in right-to-work South Carolina to assemble its new, most advanced jet, the 787 Dreamliner, giving it a factory with lower pay that wasn\u2019t at risk of going on strike in the future. Calhoun, Boeing\u2019s current CEO, took over in January 2020, nine months into the grounding of the 737 Max following two fatal crashes. He also has no engineering background, having served as senior managing director and head of portfolio operations at investing firm The Blackstone Group, CEO of Nielsen and spending 26 years at GE. Just over a year and a half later, after the pandemic reduced demand for the long-range Dreamliner due to the drop in international travel, Calhoun and Boeing decided it needed to\u00a0preserve cash\u00a0and could no longer justify two 787 plants. It had a choice between consolidating production to a veteran plant in Washington state staffed by unionized employees and a non-union South Carolina plant. It decided to close the unionized line in Washington and keep the South Carolina plant. But it soon had quality problems with the 787 Dreamliners being produced there, leading to two costly halts in deliveries, one lasting over a year. Although Boeing says it values its worldwide staff, it made deep staff cuts during the economic downturn caused by the pandemic, offering buyouts to more senior workers. The loss of expertise has proven devastating, Bank of America\u2019s Epstein said. \u201cA key variable is your workforce,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want it to be as experienced as possible. When it\u2019s all said and done, how much do you really save closing the unionized plant?\u201d Cost cutting\u2019s impact on quality Aviation safety advocate Pierson served as a senior manager at Boeing\u2019s 737 factory after a career in the military. He left the company in 2018, just months before the first fatal crash. He told CNN his frustration with top management attitudes on quality led him to quit. In 2019 he testified to Congress that there was evidence that the 737 Max was having production quality issues, including planes being delivered to airlines that had faulty hardware or other system malfunctions, problems that involved more than a dozen safety issues, some of which he described as serious. He recounted that he had recommended a halt in production of the 737 Max to deal with quality issues in the months ahead of the first crash. He said the boss to whom he had made the recommendation told him, \u201cWe can\u2019t do that, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d \u201cI pushed back, explaining that I had seen operations in the military shut down over less substantial safety issues, and those organizations had national security responsibilities,\u201d he testified. He said his supervisor responded tersely, \u201cThe military isn\u2019t a profit-making organization.\u201d Other experts agree with Pierson that despite its claims of being concerned with safety and quality, Boeing\u2019s actions suggest otherwise. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a management team whose idea of acknowledging the problem is to readjust the cash flow numbers for next year,\u201d said Aboulafia in an interview with CNN. Two fatal crashes And then disaster struck. The first fatal\u00a0crash of a 737 Max\u00a0occurred\u00a0in Indonesia in October 2018, the\u00a0second in Ethiopia in March 2019, killing a total of 346 people. It led to a 20-month grounding of all 737 Max jets. In addition to the horrifying loss of life, it cost the company more than $21 billion, making it one of the costliest corporate disasters on record, as well as one of the most deadly. After the first crash, Boeing successfully pushed to keep the planes in the air. Even after the second crash, as airline regulators around the world\u00a0grounded the jet, Boeing pushed the FAA to hold off on its own grounding order, saying that it had \u201cfull confidence in the safety\u00a0of the 737 Max\u201d and that \u201cbased on the information currently available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance\u201d to airlines. When the FAA gave in to\u00a0global and public pressure to announce its\u00a0own grounding, Boeing said it accepted the move out of an \u201cabundance of caution.\u201d Eventually it was a design flaw in the Max that was blamed for the two fatal crashes, as a feature meant to stop the planes from climbing too fast and stalling instead forced the nose of the planes downward. But critics of Boeing say the problem wasn\u2019t just the flawed design of the jet that led to the deaths, it was the decisions that Boeing made to not quickly acknowledge the problem with design after the first crash, and have a grounding take place at that time, which could have prevented the second crash. \u201cIn the light most favorable to Boeing, the first crash was an accident, the second crash is a crime,\u201d said Robert Clifford, the attorney suing Boeing on behalf of families of the victims of the second crash, the one in Ethiopia, in an interview with CNN. He said if the plane had been grounded immediately, Boeing might have ended up fixing the problem much faster, and with less expense, as well as preventing the second crash. \u201cThey gambled with people\u2019s lives and the people lost,\u201d he said. In 2021 Boeing admitted to liability in the two crashes, agreeing to pay compensatory damages, which allowed the company to avoid the possibility of having to pay far more in punitive damages. \u201cBoeing is committed to ensuring that all families who lost loved ones in the accidents are fully and fairly compensated for their loss,\u201d the company said in a statement at that time. \u201cBy accepting responsibility, Boeing\u2019s agreement with the families allows the parties to focus their efforts on determining the appropriate compensation for each family.\u201d It has also agreed to pay a $2.5 billion fine to settle charges it defrauded\u00a0the FAA when it first won approval of the flawed 737 Max. \u201cI firmly believe that entering into this resolution is the right thing for us to do \u2014 a step that appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations,\u201d Calhoun said at that time. But that agreement was criticized by the families of victims of the Ethiopian air crash as well as members of Congress as being far too lenient. About 70% of the $2.5 billion fine it agreed to pay was money it had already agreed to pay as compensation to its airline customers. Pierson said the probe that followed the second crash revealed\u00a0Boeing executives\u00a0were more concerned with continued production than finding the cause of the crash and fixing it. \u201cThey absolutely prioritized the delivery of planes over the investigation,\u201d he said. Pierson said the design flaw, as problematic as it was, was not the total problem that led to the crash. He said the quality of the work that would produce various malfunctions while the planes were in flight was just as significant as the design flaw. He points to a report from the Ethiopian Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau that looked at both fatal crashes and found that \u201cThese accidents were triggered by production quality defects that\u2026 presented as intermittent system malfunctions.\u201d Without the build quality issues causing malfunctions, the design flaw feature of the plane that forced the nose of the plane down would not have turned on, and the flights would not have crashed, according to the Ethiopian report. But that finding got little attention as the US National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA focused on design flaws rather than the build\u00a0quality issues, Pierson said. Eventually the probe provided an ugly look at the\u00a0decision-making process\u00a0at Boeing. Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as \u201cdesigned by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.\u201d Boeing\u2019s release of the documents included an apology to the FAA, Congress, airlines, and the public. The failed push for profits An ironic part of Boeing\u2019s focus on profits is that it has resulted in a company that is\u00a0in the worst financial shape in its more than 100-year history, with five years of deep losses already,\u00a0and more expected losses ahead. As recently as 2018 Boeing was riding high, reporting revenue of more than $100 billion for the first time in its history and projecting more growth to come. It had just started deliveries of the 737 Max the year before. The short-term focus on profits was, indeed, producing profits. At least for a little while. Its rival Airbus was the one struggling, on the verge of abandoning its $25 billion mistake, the A380 superjumbo jet that had turned out to be a white elephant with little demand from airlines or passengers. Despite that, the two companies were neck-and-neck in orders and deliveries. But in less than a decade, all that has changed. Airbus delivered 735 commercial jets last year. Boeing only 528. Net orders and the backlog of jets each is waiting to build show a larger imbalance. And while Airbus is forecast to report adjusted net income of 4.3 billion euros, or $4.7 billion profit, for 2023 when it reports results, Boeing just reported an operating loss of $3.2 billion for the year. Aboulafia said the short-sighted push for profits has put the company at\u00a0a severe competitive disadvantage to Airbus, and that Calhoun and other top managers at Boeing, as well as its board, need to go if the company is to have a chance to turn things around. Despite the losses and severely weakened market position of Boeing, there is little chance it could go out of business. The airlines around the world that have already bought Boeing planes basically need to keep using those models, whatever the problems. Commercial pilots are certified on specific models\u00a0and are not able to easily move\u00a0from single-aisle to widebody versions of Boeing jets, let alone between a Boeing and an Airbus jet. And having different models means the airlines need to have a large, expensive supply of spare parts on hand to keep their planes in the air. And any Boeing customer who canceled their orders today would have to get in line behind a backlog of more than 8,600 jets that Airbus has already agreed to build for its existing customers. \u201cIt\u2019s a very weird industry. It has high barriers to entry and only two players. You can get away with nonsense like this,\u201d said Aboulafia. Pierson said incident reports on planes that Boeing continues to build, while not nearly as dramatic as the Alaska Air incident, suggest the\u00a0pressure to put profits over quality remains, despite Boeing\u2019s claims. \u201cThe company has gutted quality control so they can produce more airplanes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe employees are completely overwhelmed. Everybody is focused on the Max 9, and rightfully so. That incident should never have happened. But there are issues on other planes. It has become a recipe for disaster.\u201d",

            "text": "Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said that Boeing is responsible for the incident of door plug blowing out of a 737 Max 9 in flight earlier this month, saying that Boeing must do a better job than it did in this instance. \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that,\u201d he told investors during a call after reporting the latest quarterly loss at the company. \u201cWhatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better.\u201d Boeing did not give the financial guidance that it normally provides to investors, nor say when it might be able to provide two new versions of the 737 Max that it has promised to airlines, but which have yet to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration. \u201cWhile we often use this time of year to share or update our financial and operational objectives, now is not the time for that,\u201d Calhoun said in comments to Boeing employees that were published by the company. The January 5 incident in which a door plug blew out on an Alaska Airlines flight has put the company on the defensive once again. Fortunately, no one died, as the crew was able to make an emergency landing within minutes of the hole opening, but the brief flight terrified passengers who had cell phones and clothing ripped outside the plane. It led to a three-week grounding of the Boeing 737 Max 9 model as inspections discovered problems with the installation of other door plugs. \u201cI\u2019ve had tough and direct conversations with our customers, regulators and lawmakers,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are disappointed, and we have much to prove to earn our stakeholders\u2019 confidence.\u201d Calhoun\u2019s statements came as the manufacturer posted another loss for 2023, while failing to provide a 2024 financial outlook that would have included expectations of approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for two new versions of the jet, the longer 737 Max 10 and the shorter 737 Max 7. In the wake of the door plug incident, the FAA has said it will not allow the company to move ahead with planned increases in production of existing models. And two major customers, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines, said last week they are pushing back plans indefinitely for deliveries they had been counting on for both models. \u201cOur people on the factory floor know what we must do to improve better than anyone,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cWe will go slow, we will not rush the system and we will take our time to do it right.\u201d \u201cIncreased scrutiny \u2014 whether from ourselves, from our regulator, or from others \u2014 will make us better,\u201d he added. In an interview Wednesday on CNBC, Calhoun said he\u2019s not going to predict what the National Transportation Safety Board, which is conducting an investigation of the incident, will find as the cause. But he said that \u201cI am convinced we have this [door] plug completely under control.\u201d The 737 Max 9 also got a vote of confidence Wednesday from Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the NTSB. \u201cI would have no problem getting on a Max 9 tomorrow and flying,\u201d Homendy told CNN in an interview. \u201cHere\u2019s what I will say about aviation safety overall. It is safe, but there are issues.\u201d She said the NTSB is in the \u201cfinal stages\u201d of preparing a preliminary report on the Alaska Air incident. \u201cWe want to make sure it\u2019s right,\u201d Homendy said about the agency\u2019s preliminary findings. \u201cThis is a somewhat complex issue with a lot of parts.\u201d In his appearance on CNBC, Calhoun also defended the company\u2019s decision not to give updated financial guidance. The company did say it is now producing 38 737 Max jets a month, but that is fewer than it needs to once again make a profit on its best-selling plane. The FAA\u2019s limit on increased production of the Max in the wake of the Alaska Air incident will delay Boeing\u2019s ability to return to profitability. \u201cOur full attention, our full focus as a company is to make certain we never have a safety [incident] again, to learn everything we can from the accident, learn everything we can from the FAA\u2019s audit, learn everything we can from\u2026 the ideas given to us by our own people,\u201d he said. Asked if Boeing has lost the confidence of its airline customers, he said that so far the customers are telling the company they are sticking with Boeing. \u201cWas this a shot at them? Absolutely. As I said, these moments shake all of us to the bone \u2013 Boeing, our people, our customers, everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cOur job is to restore confidence at every level. They want Boeing to win. They want us to succeed.\u201d In what passes for good news for the troubled company, Boeing reported an adjusted loss of 47 cents a share, or about $285 million, in the fourth quarter, much better than the $1.75 a share loss a year earlier and the 78 cents a share loss estimates from analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The company has not only reported losses in all but one quarter since late 2019, it has almost always reported a bigger loss than forecasts. Shares of Boeing, which have lost nearly 20% of their value since the Alaska Air incident, were narrowly higher in premarket trading Wednesday on Calhoun\u2019s comments and the quarterly report.",

            "text": "A United States Air Force F-16 fighter jet crashed after suffering an in-flight emergency off the coast of South Korea Wednesday, in the third crash of one of the US military\u2019s Korea-based warplanes in less than a year. The incident occurred during a training mission over the waters west of the Korean Peninsula around 8:41 a.m. local time, according to a statement from Kunsan Air Base, about 110 miles (180 kilometers) south of the capital Seoul. The pilot, assigned to the 8th Fighter Wing, ejected safely and was recovered about 50 minutes after the crash, the Air Force statement said. The pilot was conscious and taken to a medical facility for assessment, the base said. \u201cWe are very thankful to the Republic of Korea rescue forces and all of our teammates who made the swift recovery of our pilot possible,\u201d said Col. Matthew Gaetke, 8th Fighter Wing commander, in a statement. \u201cNow we will shift our focus to search and recovery of the aircraft.\u201d The cause of the in-flight emergency is under investigation, the base said. Wednesday\u2019s crash was the third of a South Korea-based F-16 in less than a year, though there are no indications they are related. In December, an F-16 from Kunsan crashed off the west coast of the peninsula during training. The pilot ejected and was rescued by South Korean maritime forces, the 8th Fighter Wing said at the time, adding that no more information on that crash would be released until an investigation was concluded. In May 2023, an F-16 crashed into an agricultural area near Osan Air Base, south of Seoul, during training. The pilot of that aircraft also ejected safely, and the case was referred to investigation. The F-16 is the workhorse of US Air Force fighters, with 738 of the single-engine jets in the fleet, according to Flight Global\u2019s \u201cWorld Air Forces 2024.\u201d The Air Force says F-16s make up about half of its fighter jet inventory. The service loses between three and four units of the aircraft each year to mishaps worldwide, according to statistics from the Air Force Safety Center, last provided after fiscal year 2021.",

            "text": "The CEO of Europe\u2019s largest airline, who not so long ago described Boeing management as \u201cheadless chickens,\u201d has come out in strong support of the beleaguered US planemaker, pushing back against criticism from several other carriers after this month\u2019s mid-flight breakage on a Boeing aircraft. \u201cI have a lot of confidence both personally and professionally in David Calhoun and in Brian West,\u201d Ryanair\u2019s Michael O\u2019Leary said Monday, referring to Boeing\u2019s CEO and chief financial officer respectively. \u201cI know they are under attack from certain quarters. They are doing a good job, they are turning that company around. I think safety is their number one byword,\u201d he commented in a video posted on Ryanair\u2019s website to coincide with its third-quarter earnings. Ryanair, which also owns Polish airline Buzz and Austrian carrier Lauda, is one of Boeing\u2019s biggest customers and the planemaker\u2019s performance is crucial to the budget carrier\u2019s success \u2014 as evidenced by the way repeated delays in the delivery of Boeing aircraft have hampered Ryanair\u2019s growth. Still, O\u2019Leary\u2019s comments stand in sharp contrast to his previous scathing criticism of Boeing\u2019s top brass. In May 2022, he said the company\u2019s executives needed either an immediate \u201creboot, or a boot up the a**.\u201d His backing also represents a rare show of support for Boeing, which has come under fire from several of its other airline customers \u2014 including Alaska, American and United \u2014 after a part of a Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft shot out from the side of the fuselage only a few minutes into an Alaska Airlines flight, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing. Calhoun \u2014 who was appointed to the top job in January 2020 as Boeing was already struggling with quality and safety issues \u2014 will unveil the planemaker\u2019s full-year results Wednesday. Like his predecessor Dennis Muilenberg, Calhoun is facing close scrutiny from customers, regulators and investors. Shareholders are nursing heavy losses, with Boeing\u2019s stock down around 17% since the incident on January 5. The blowout has also raised questions about whether Boeing will be able to secure orders for its newer, larger Max 10 aircraft, which has yet to be approved for service by the US Federal Aviation Administration. In an interview with CNBC last week, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said the airline was \u201cgoing to build a plan that doesn\u2019t have the Max 10 in it.\u201d And Reuters reported Sunday that Kirby recently flew to the French city of Toulouse to discuss a potential deal to buy planes from Boeing\u2019s archrival Airbus. Ryanair, for its part, remains committed to the Max 10, having inked a $40 billion deal last year to buy up to 300 of the aircraft. \u201cThe Max 10 order is vital to Ryanair\u2019s growth,\u201d O\u2019Leary said Monday. \u201cAnd if United or any other airline don\u2019t want to take their Max 10 orders, we\u2019ll be happy to step in\u2026and take some of our Max 10 deliveries earlier.\u201d \u201cBoeing are still making great aircraft, but they do have to improve quality control and the quality of what they\u2019re delivering to their airline customers,\u201d he added, saying on an earnings call later that Ryanair was putting more of its own engineers in factories that build Boeing planes to run extra checks. O\u2019Leary said Ryanair\u2019s growth had been \u201cheld back slightly\u201d by Boeing\u2019s delivery delays, leading the airline to lower its traffic forecast for the year ending in March 2024 from 185 million passengers to 183.5 million passengers. Meanwhile, disputes with online travel agencies \u2014 which O\u2019Leary described as \u201cpirates\u201d \u2014 saw Ryanair\u2019s flights removed from their websites in early December, forcing the airline to cut fares to fill unsold seats in the October-to-December quarter. Partly because of this, Ryanair expects full-year profit for the current financial year to be at the lower end of a range of \u20ac1.85 billion-\u20ac1.95 billion ($2 billion-$2.1 billion) \u2014 trimming a November forecast of up to \u20ac2.05 billion ($2.2 billion). That would still be up from its previous record of \u20ac1.45 billion ($1.6 billion) earned in 2018, before the Covid-19 pandemic. Ryanair has since struck deals with Love Holidays in the United Kingdom and Kiwi.com in Europe, and is in talks with other travel agencies, which will see users book flights directly on its website.",

A special investigative committee found irregularities during horsepower output testing for the certification of three diesel engine models. Ten models use the affected engines globally,\u00a0Toyota\u00a0(TM) said, including the Hiace van, Fortuner SUV, Innova multi-purpose vehicle and Lexus-branded LX500D SUV. Toyota, the world\u2019s biggest automaker by sales, has been separately seeking to resolve a\u00a0case of misconduct\u00a0related to rigged collision safety tests at small car specialist Daihatsu. The company said it would take measures such as running new engine certification tests in the presence of regulators as needed. \u201cThere was a lack of communication with\u00a0Toyota\u00a0Motor and not enough coordination about testing processes and procedures that should have been followed,\u201d\u00a0Toyota\u00a0Industries President Koichi Ito said at a press conference. Toyota\u00a0Industries said it sold about 84,000 of the affected automobile diesel engines during the financial year to Mar. 31, 2023. A\u00a0Toyota\u00a0spokesperson could not immediately say how many affected vehicles the automaker had sold over the years. The company said it had re-confirmed that affected engines and vehicles met engine performance output standards. It added the investigation had found that electronic control units used during horsepower output testing were different from those used during engine production. Japan\u2019s transport ministry said it would conduct on Tuesday an on-site investigation of\u00a0Toyota\u00a0Industries\u2019 Hekinan plant in central Aichi prefecture where the company makes automotive and industrial engines. Toyota\u2019s investigation initially focused on certification regulations relating to emissions performance of forklift and construction machinery engines, where the special investigative committee also confirmed wrongdoing. The company holds a near 25% stake in\u00a0Toyota\u00a0Industries, which is a key\u00a0Toyota\u00a0group company. The supplier in turn owns about 8% of\u00a0Toyota\u00a0shares itself.

It is the first revenue flight for this model since the Federal Aviation Administration grounded the Boeing jets three weeks ago following a door plug blowout on Alaska Airlines flight 1282.

She said she felt anxious at first. \u201cBut then realizing it\u2019s probably the safest plane out there right now, it\u2019s been through lots of tests since then,\u201d Edgbert said. \u201cI am not going to stop doing what I do,\u201d Kent, who did not want to give his last name, said. \u201cI am not going to change my habits for it, and I am going to be hoping that something bad doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d Doug Bowman didn\u2019t know that he\u2019d be boarding a Max 9 plane until he was informed by CNN, but said he had \u201cimportant things, engagements to get back to\u201d in San Diego.

            "text": "The Alaska Airlines incident on January 5 that left a hole in the fuselage of a Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft shortly after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, raised important safety questions, prompted investigations \u2013 and left some air travelers on edge. After the incident that caused no deaths, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded all US 737 Max 9 aircraft that have the door plug feature until the planes could be thoroughly inspected. While questions flew in ensuing days, the planes stayed on the ground. Roughly three weeks later, the grounded Max 9\u2019s are set to return to service. Here\u2019s what CNN Travel knows about the current 737 Max 9 situation and what air travelers need to know: What has the FAA decided on the Max 9\u2019s? The FAA has approved a process to\u00a0allow\u00a0the Boeing 737 Max 9 to fly again.\u00a0That move clears the way for airlines to begin inspecting the planes so that they can be OK\u2019d to fly. Each of the 171 grounded aircraft must undergo the process. That includes inspection of the bolts, fittings and guide tracks for the door plug, the piece of fuselage that flew off an Alaska Airlines plane earlier this month.\u00a0It also includes tightening fasteners and performing \u201cdetailed inspections of \u2026 dozens of associated components.\u201d \u201cThis aircraft will not operate until the process is complete and compliance with the original design is confirmed,\u201d the FAA statement said. Alaska Airlines and United Airlines were the US carriers most-affected by the grounding. What are Alaska Airlines\u2019 plans? Alaska Airlines plans to return some of its 737 Max 9 planes to service on Friday, the company said Wednesday in a news release. \u201cEach of our aircraft will only return to service once the rigorous inspections are completed and each aircraft is deemed airworthy according to the FAA requirements. We have 65 737-9\u00a0MAX in our fleet. The inspections are expected to take up to 12 hours for each plane,\u201d the airline said. The airline said Thursday that it expects its all of its Max 9 planes to be flying in the first week of February. Click the link to check Alaska Airlines\u2019 travel policy. What are United Airlines\u2019 plans? On Thursday, United Airlines said it is adding the Max 9 back to its schedule starting Sunday. But the Max 9 could carry some United passengers as soon as Friday. That\u2019s because Max 9s that have been inspected and cleared according to FAA instructions will be available as \u201coperational spares,\u201d according to the airline. So if the airline was going to cancel a flight because of a mechanical issue, but a cleared Max 9 is available at the airport, it can be used as a substitute aircraft. Click here for United Airlines\u2019 latest travel alerts. What\u2019s the future of the Max? In a word: Uncertain. Along with announcing the inspection process to get grounded Max 9\u2019s into the air, the FAA told Boeing that \u201cit will not grant any production expansion of the MAX, including the 737-9 MAX,\u201d the agency said in its news release. \u201cLet me be clear: This won\u2019t be back to business as usual for Boeing,\u201d FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said. \u201cWe will not agree to any request from Boeing for an expansion in production or approve additional production lines for the 737 MAX until we are satisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved.\u201d Is it still safe to fly? In clearing the Boeing 737 Max 9 to fly following rigorous inspection, the FAA is saying \u201cyes.\u201d FAA Administrator Whitaker underlined that point to CNN\u2019s Pete Muntean earlier this week. \u201cIf the aircraft is ungrounded, that means that we believe it\u2019s airworthy. And if it\u2019s airworthy, the aircraft is safe. I can say that we\u2019re not going to let that aircraft back in the air until we\u2019re convinced that that issue has been taken care of,\u201d Whitaker said. CNN transportation analyst Mary Schiavo on Thursday pointed to some \u201cvery dramatic things\u201d that the FAA is doing in response to the Alaska Airlines incident, including sending dozens of inspectors to perform hands-on inspections at Boeing and its crackdown on Max production. \u201cSo when the FAA administrator says, \u2018yes, the planes are safe because we say they\u2019re safe to fly,\u2019 what he\u2019s really saying is the aircraft meets the certification requirements we have put in place for the aircraft,\u201d said Schiavo, former inspector general of the Department of Transportation. \u201cBut with the FAA putting all of these new resources in play, it will certainly help the safety of Boeing. But Boeing\u2019s not out of the woods yet. The FAA in doing a deep-dive will find additional problems \u2026 but, they will fix them.\u201d Kathleen Bangs, a former airline pilot, said shortly after the Alaska Airlines incident that she understands \u201cwhy people are frustrated \u2013 and nervous \u2013 about this,\u201d noting that it\u2019s just been a couple of years since another member of the Max family of aircraft, the Boeing 737 Max 8, was returned to service after being grounded for nearly two years. That followed two fatal crashes attributed to problems with the aircraft\u2019s automated Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS. Bangs said she was impressed with the FAA\u2019s \u201cright decision\u201d to quickly ground the Max 9 on January 6, a move it was slow in making for the Max 8. She also acknowledged Boeing\u2019s \u201cquality control issue.\u201d But Bangs said she believes that authorities will ensure that all of the door plugs are secure, \u201cbut I certainly understand, when you add that to the problems of the Max 8, why people are getting nervous about flying on this particular version of the 737.\u201d Bangs said she\u2019s not nervous, and she added that she\u2019s confident that once an issue has been identified and addressed, it is safe. How can I find out my type of plane? Bangs pointed out potential passengers can see what kind of equipment the flight is operating on in the \u201cdetails\u201d section when they book flights. FlightAware\u2019s Where is My Plane feature will also provide the specific airplane model and tail number registration. Scott Keyes, founder of travel site Going.com, explained that \u201cwhen you purchase a flight, it will say on your receipt what aircraft you\u2019re scheduled to fly (typically near the flight number).\u201d But be prepared for last-minute changes, Keyes warned. \u201cDo note that aircraft swaps happen occasionally; what you were originally scheduled to fly is usually but not always the same model you ultimately fly.\u201d In that case, Bangs said passengers can use the tail number of the plane at the gate to double-check the type of aircraft.",

The fourth quarter income was better than forecast for Alaska. The door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines flight on January 5, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. While no passengers were killed, the incident led the Federal Aviation Administration to order a grounding of all 737 Max 9 jets. With 65 of the planes Alaska has the second most 737 Max 9 jets in its fleet, behind only United, which has also warned it expects a first quarter loss at least partly due to the cost of the grounding. On Wednesday, the FAA spelled out inspection procedures to return the planes to flight. Alaska Air said the first of its grounded jets will be back in service on Friday with more planes added every day as reviews are completed and each aircraft is deemed airworthy. \u201cWe expect inspections on all our 737-9 Max to be completed over the next week,\u201d it said. The cost to Alaska Air is primarily from lost revenue, as the cost to compensate customers for hotels when their flights are canceled and overtime for staff will be balanced by the fuel savings achieved by flying 3,000 fewer flights. Alaska could ultimately pass the cost onto Boeing, as CFO Shane Tackett told investors Thursday that \u201cwe fully expect to be made whole for the profit impact of the grounding.\u201d But he said there are no details of that compensation as of yet. The airline also expects that most passengers will be willing to return to the 737 Max 9 once it starts flying again. \u201cI think at first, people will have some questions, some anxiety just like they did two years ago,\u201d Alaska CEO Ben Minicucci said, referring to when all models of the Max were approved to fly again following a 20-month grounding precipitated by two fatal crashes. \u201cBut I believe over time, the confidence will get back into this airplane.\u201d The airline said Thursday that even if the planes return to service as planned, it will have had to cancel about 3,000 flights this month due to the grounding reducing its overall capacity by about 7% for the quarter as a whole. Minicucci told NBC in an interview Tuesday that the carrier found \u201csome loose bolts on many\u201d Boeing 737 Max 9 during its inspections. But when asked during an investors call Thursday if he was reconsidering the airline\u2019s decision to buy only Boeing aircraft going forward, he would not back off those plans. \u201cWe have a\u00a0long-standing deep relationship with Boeing. But\u00a0like I said, it\u2019s not acceptable what happened. We\u2019re going to hold them accountable, and we\u2019re going\u00a0to raise the bar on quality on Boeing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got 231 737s that\u00a0we\u2019ve been happy with. And until the incident, we were happy with the Max.\u00a0We have 185 on order that are coming\u00a0to us. We believe with the network configuration we \u2026 have,\u00a0the Boeing\u00a0airplane is 737 is well suited for our network. So that is\u00a0the long-term plan, but we\u2019re going to hold Boeing\u2019s feet to\u00a0the fire to make sure that we\u00a0get good airplanes out of that\u00a0factory.\u201d Even with the $150 million hit from the grounding,  Alaska said it still expects to report a full-year 2024 profit of about $381 million to $635 million, but that guidance suggests it could fall short of estimates of $583 million, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Analysts are forecasting a loss of $79 million in the first quarter. Alaska and United are the only US airlines with the 737 Max 9 jet in their fleets. But it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the only affected by the problems at Boeing. Southwest Airlines said Thursday that it now expects fewer 737 Max deliveries from Boeing this year than it had booked because one of the models it orders, the 737 Max 7, has yet to be certified by the FAA. Its order book calls for the delivery of 27 of the Max 7 this year, along with 53 of the Max 8, but the airline said that \u201cshould no longer be relied upon.\u201d \u201cThe FAA will ultimately determine the timing of the [737 Max] 7 certification and entry into service, and the company therefore offers no assurances that current estimations and timelines are correct,\u201d it said. Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said the airline is no longer counting on any of the 737 Max 7 planes being delivered in 2024 but that it will be ready to change which planes it gets from Boeing. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the Max 7, we\u2019ll take a Max 8,\u201d he said in an interview on CNBC. He said it\u2019s not clear what the FAA decision announced Wednesday to limit the growth of 737 Max production going forward will have on its deliveries. \u201cAs always, if there\u2019s an adjustment, we\u2019ll adjust,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain, I support that [limitation]. Anything that helps Boeing improve quality, address the issues, is good for Boeing, and it is good for Southwest Airlines.\u201d American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said he doesn\u2019t expect a delay in the deliveries of the planes it is due to get from Boeing this year. But he also had criticism of the aircraft maker. \u201cWe need them to produce a quality product every time. We need everyone at Boeing getting their act together. It\u2019s just essential,\u201d he said in an interview on CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable. We don\u2019t need the distraction. Southwest does not have any 737 Max 9 jets, the one that was grounded this month, nor orders to buy any. But it does have more than 200 of the 737 Max 8, making up about a quarter of its fleet. CEO Bob Jordan said his airline, which flies nothing but Boeing 737\u2019s, said he doesn\u2019t believe that passengers will be reluctant to book on his airline due to its use of Boeing and 737 Max jets. \u201cOur customers want confidence in our product. They have a lot of confidence in Boeing, just like I do,\u201d he said on CNBC. \u201cThe Max 8 is a terrific aircraft. I have confidence Boeing will address the issues. And our customers have a lot of faith in Southwest Airlines.\u201d",

Although federal investigators continue to probe the incident and have not reached any conclusions, the details could provide critical new insight into what may have caused a gaping hole to form in a 737 Max 9 mid-flight. The reports said the door plug, a part of the plane used to seal the aircraft when no exit door is installed, was removed because Spirit AeroSystems, which makes the fuselage for 737 Max 9 planes, needed to make other repairs to the door plug\u2019s rivets, used to connect various parts together. Boeing then reinstalled the door after Spirit AeroSystems made the repair. Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems are under multiple investigations that probe their safety policies and procedures. The Federal Aviation Administration recently expanded its Boeing probe to include Spirit AeroSystems, the National Transportation Safety Board is also reviewing the incident, and Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, announced Wednesday that she would hold a future hearing to investigate Boeing\u2019s safety record. Boeing said it couldn\u2019t comment on the reports about what may have led to the door plug blowing off the plane, citing the ongoing investigation. \u201cAs the air safety agency responsible for investigating this accident, only the US National Transportation Safety Board can release information about the investigation,\u201d Boeing said in a statement. Spirit did not respond to a request for comment. Although details are sparse, there have been some clues about what went wrong over the past few weeks. Boeing CEO David Calhoun on January 9\u00a0acknowledged the company made a \u201cmistake\u201d\u00a0at a staff-wide safety meeting, but he did not specify what that mistake was. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy has demanded Boeing provide answers about any mistake it made as part of its safety investigation, which is separate from the FAA\u2019s audit. Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci on Tuesday revealed the carrier found \u201csome loose bolts on many\u201d Boeing 737 Max 9s in an interview for \u201cNBC Nightly News with Lester Holt.\u201d Returning the planes to service The FAA has grounded the 737 Max 9 since the incident. But late Wednesday, it approved a set of inspection criteria for the 171 grounded planes that, if followed, could return the grounded aircraft to service. But the agency also issued a stern warning to Boeing: \u201cThe January 5 Boeing 737-9 Max incident must never happen again.\u201d And it said it would not grant any production expansion of the 737 Max lineup while its safety probe of Boeing continues. Airlines, especially Alaska and United, had faced hundreds of cancellations a day because of the grounding. \u201cThe exhaustive, enhanced review our team completed after several weeks of information gathering gives me and the FAA confidence to proceed to the inspection and maintenance phase,\u201d FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement Wednesday. Each of the 171 grounded aircraft must be inspected, including the bolts, fittings and guide tracks for the door plug. The process\u00a0also includes tightening fasteners and performing \u201cdetailed inspections of\u2026dozens of associated components.\u201d FAA on Sunday also required airlines to ensure older Boeing 737 planes with similar door plugs were secure. The FAA said airlines\u00a0operating the Boeing 737-900ER model should visually inspect the planes but didn\u2019t require them to be grounded. Alaska Airlines on Thursday said it has completed all of those inspections \u201cwith only one minor finding, which was immediately corrected.\u201d In a statement Wednesday, Boeing said it will \u201ccontinue to cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA and follow their direction as we take action to strengthen safety and quality at Boeing.\u201d But Whitaker noted Boeing itself is not out of the woods. \u201cLet me be clear: This won\u2019t be back to business as usual for Boeing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not agree to any request from Boeing for an expansion in production or approve additional production lines for the 737 Max until we are satisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved.\u201d A history of problems Boeing has faced\u00a0repeated quality and safety issues\u00a0with its aircraft for five years now, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and the halt in deliveries of others. The 737 Max\u2019s design was found to be responsible for two fatal crashes: one in Indonesia in October 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019. Together, the crashes killed all 346 people\u00a0aboard the two flights and led to a\u00a020-month grounding\u00a0of the company\u2019s best-selling jets, which\u00a0cost it more than $21 billion. Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as \u201cdesigned by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.\u201d Late last month, Boeing asked airlines to\u00a0inspect all of their 737 Max jets\u00a0for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft. Its quality and engineering problems have extended beyond the 737. Boeing also had to twice halt deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, for\u00a0about a year\u00a0starting in 2021\u00a0and again in 2023, due to quality concerns cited by the FAA.\u00a0And the\u00a0777 jet\u00a0also suffered a grounding after an engine failure on a United flight\u00a0scattered debris\u00a0onto homes and the ground below. Two Max variants \u2014 the Max 7 and the Max 10 \u2014 are still awaiting approval to begin carrying passengers. This latest incident complicates that, Wells Fargo analysts noted.",

            "text": "Boeing has delivered its first 737 Max to a Chinese airline for the first time in nearly five years, according to flight data, in a rare spot of good news for the embattled company. The delivery is seen as an important affirmation from a key market for the plane maker, whose reputation for safety and quality in its commercial jets was dealt a massive blow following a\u00a0terrifying accident\u00a0aboard a 10-week-old 737 Max 9 flight on January 5. According to flight tracking website Flightradar 24, China Southern Airlines flight CZ5073 departed from Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington, on Wednesday for China via Honolulu. The use of the airline\u2019s flight number, instead of a Boeing one, suggests the ownership of the plane has already been transferred. Boeing (BA) declined to comment on the apparent delivery. The plane, a 737 Max 8 according to flight data, was built in September 2019 and has been parked in Boeing\u2019s Seattle factory since then, according to flight tracking sites Flightradar 24 and Aviation Flights. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded the aircraft in March 2019 after 346 people died in two separate fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. It was discovered that a safety feature meant to stop the plane from climbing too fast and stalling had improperly forced the nose of the plane down, causing the crashes, as\u00a0CNN reported previously. Chinese aviation authorities instructed its airlines in March 2019 to ground all their 737 Max 8 aircraft, citing the need for \u201cstrict control of safety risks.\u201d That ban was lifted in 2021, following the model\u2019s clearance by the FAA, but there haven\u2019t been any new deliveries of the model to China until now. In December, the trade publication the Air Current said Boeing had won a key clearance from China\u2019s aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), allowing Boeing to prepare Max aircraft for delivery, Reuters reported.",

It said inspections would be completed next week.  United Airlines announced that it has received approval from the FAA to return to its fleet 79 Boeing 737 Max 9 planes this weekend, according to a memo from the airline\u2019s operations chief that was obtained by CNN. \u201cWe will return each Max 9 aircraft to service once this thorough inspection process is complete,\u201d said Toby Enqvist, executive vice president and chief operations officer at United. \u201cWe are preparing aircraft to return to scheduled service beginning on Sunday\u201d And Whitaker noted Boeing itself is not out of the woods. \u201cHowever, let me be clear: This won\u2019t be back to business as usual for Boeing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not agree to any request from Boeing for an expansion in production or approve additional production lines for the 737 Max until we are satisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved.\u201d Mr. Calhoun goes to Washington Calhoun\u2019s meeting with Washington lawmakers on Wednesday ended with a CEO\u2019s nightmare: He was forced to defend the safety of his company\u2019s planes to travelers, just before he learned Boeing faced yet another investigation. \u201cWe fly safe planes,\u201d Calhoun said to reporters assembled on Capitol Hill. \u201cWe don\u2019t put planes in the air that we don\u2019t have 100% confidence in.\u201d Calhoun acknowledged the seriousness of passengers\u2019 concerns about flying, and he said he came to Washington in the spirit of transparency and openness to help lawmakers better understand the company\u2019s efforts to improve safety. \u201cI\u2019m here today \u2026 to answer all their questions, because they have a lot of them,\u201d Calhoun said. After speaking with reporters, Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, announced that she should hold a future hearing to investigate Boeing\u2019s safety record. \u201cThe American flying public and Boeing line workers deserve a culture of leadership at Boeing that puts safety ahead of profits,\u201d Cantwell said in a statement. \u201cI will be holding hearings to investigate the root causes of these safety lapses.\u201d Cantwell said that in her meeting with Calhoun earlier in the day, she emphasized that Boeing has to prioritize quality and engineering first. After several incidents in recent years, including this month\u2019s Alaska Airlines incident, that commitment has become a significant question. The National Transportation Safety Board is also investigating the incident. A history of safety problems Not being able to increase production of the Max is a major blow to Boeing\u2019s efforts to return to profitability. Boeing\u2019s production of the 737 Max, its best selling plane, has still not returned to the rate of production that it had before two fatal crashes led to a 20-month grounding of the plane in 2019.\u00a0It is not clear when it will be able to move ahead with its efforts to resume production at a more profitable pace. Industry experts have cast serious doubt about Boeing\u2019s ability to walk away from its investigations unscathed. Last week, a Wells Fargo report, entitled \u201cFAA audit opens up a whole new can of worms,\u201d noted that Boeing\u2019s\u00a0quality control and engineering problems\u00a0have been ongoing for years. \u201cGiven Boeing\u2019s recent track record, and greater incentive for the FAA to find problems, we think the odds of a clean audit are low,\u201d the analysts said.

            "text": "Alaska Airlines has found loose bolts on \u201cmany\u201d of its Boeing Max 9 planes that were recently grounded for inspections, the carrier\u2019s CEO announced Tuesday. Federal investigators are now considering when Max 9s will be safe to fly again as pressure mounts to add oversight on the airplane maker\u2019s production line. Here\u2019s what else you need to know to\u00a0Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Presidential race Former President Donald Trump won New Hampshire\u2019s Republican primary on Tuesday, defeating former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and moving him closer to a rematch with President Joe Biden in the fall. He secured 55% of the state\u2019s vote compared to Haley\u2019s 43%, according to CNN\u2019s polling data. Trump is the first non-incumbent GOP candidate in the modern era to win both the Iowa and New Hampshire contests. Haley, though, has vowed to stay in the race and told her supporters that there are \u201cdozens of states left to go.\u201d On the Democratic side, President Biden \u2014 who is all but guaranteed to be his party\u2019s nominee \u2014 won the state\u2019s primary as a write-in candidate. 2. Russia plane crash A Russian military plane with 74 people on board has crashed in the Belgorod region of Russia, near the Ukrainian border, Russian state media reported today. While the cause of the crash is unclear, Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said none of the passengers survived. Ukraine claims the IL-76 plane was carrying air defense missiles, but that assertion is at odds with Russian claims that 65 Ukrainian servicemen were on board ahead of a prisoner exchange. The head of the Russian Parliament\u2019s defense committee, Andrey Kartapolov, also alleged Ukraine was responsible for downing the plane, although CNN cannot verify either of these claims. 3. Gaza Thousands of displaced Palestinians are fleeing Khan Younis in Gaza as Israeli forces surround the southern city. CNN reporters on the ground are witnessing cars, trucks, and tractors transporting families and their belongings, and crowds of people walking. Meanwhile, Qatar said it is engaged in \u201cserious discussions\u201d with Israel and Hamas over a possible ceasefire deal to end the monthslong conflict. However, the White House says the ongoing talks have not yet reached the level of \u201cnegotiations\u201d and instead describes them as \u201csober and serious\u201d discussions about what might be acceptable to all sides. 4. Tech industry More than 13,000 tech employees have been laid off so far this year, data shows, as the industry doubles down on investments in artificial intelligence. On Tuesday, eBay\u2019s CEO Jamie Iannone announced the company is cutting 1,000 positions, or about 9% of its full-time employees, citing the \u201cchallenging macroeconomic environment.\u201d Meanwhile, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has warned employees to expect additional layoffs in the months to come as the tech giant reorients itself toward AI \u201cand beyond.\u201d Duolingo laid off around 10% of its contract workers as it moves toward a more heavy reliance on artificial intelligence tools. Amazon has also cut hundreds of jobs this year, including at the game streaming platform Twitch. 5. Oscars Nominations for the 96th Academy Awards were revealed on Tuesday. Christopher Nolan\u2019s atomic thriller \u201cOppenheimer\u201d had a strong showing, leading Oscar contenders with 13 nominations. The fantasy film \u201cPoor Things,\u201d starring Emma Stone, followed with 11, while the Martin Scorsese drama \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d received 10 nominations. Notably, the summer blockbuster \u201cBarbie\u201d earned eight nods, including Ryan Gosling in the supporting actor category. But Gosling and many others are questioning the omission of his co-star Margot Robbie and director Greta Gerwig from their respective categories. The Oscars will take place on March 10, hosted for a fourth time by Jimmy Kimmel.

            "text": "Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci revealed the carrier found \u201csome loose bolts on many\u201d Boeing 737 Max 9s in an interview for \u201cNBC Nightly News with Lester Holt\u201d on\u00a0Tuesday. It was the CEO\u2019s first interview since\u00a0a door plug on one of its Max 9 airplanes shot out\u00a0from the side of the fuselage only a few minutes into a flight from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing. \u201cI\u2019m more than frustrated and disappointed. I am angry. This happened to Alaska Airlines. It happened to our guests and happened to our people,\u201d Minicucci said, according to excerpts released ahead of the interview\u2019s airing. \u201cBoeing is better than this.\u00a0Flight 1282 should never have happened,\u201d Minicucci said during the interview. Boeing\u2019s 737 factory will have what the company calls a \u201cquality stand down\u201d at its Renton, Washington facility Thursday, the company announced Tuesday. \u201cDuring the session, production, delivery and support teams will pause for a day so employees can take part in working sessions focused on quality. This is part of the immediate quality actions recently shared by Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal,\u201d the company said in a statement. The internal notice Boeing sent to its employees indicates that the 737 stand down is the first of several that it will hold at its facilities. NBC asked Minicucci if Boeing has a problem with quality control extending beyond a single plane. \u201cI think this is the issue that\u2019s at question right here, which is what is Boeing going to do differently on their quality program, to make sure that when we get an airplane, it\u2019s at the highest degree of excellence and that\u2019s what\u2019s got to be different going forward,\u201d he said. He added that the company is adding its own extra oversight on the airplane maker\u2019s production line.  The US Federal Aviation Administration urged airlines on Sunday to inspect so-called door plugs on an earlier version of Boeing 737 airplanes. After recent inspections of the newer Max 9s, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines have found loose bolts. FAA opened a formal investigation into Boeing\u2019s quality control around two weeks ago. The agency said it continued to review data collected from inspections of 40 sample aircraft as it considered how to determine if the planes were safe to fly again. Minicucci noted in the interview that the inspections take about 10 hours per door. In a statement, Stan Deal, the CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said: \u201cWe have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers. We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance. We will follow the lead of the FAA and support our customers every step of the way.\u201d The CEO of United Airlines, one of the biggest buyers of Boeing jets, also expressed frustration with the company. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that\u2026 this keeps happening at Boeing. This isn\u2019t new,\u201d said Scott Kirby, CEO of United, in an interview Tuesday on CNBC. \u201cWe need Boeing to succeed. But they\u2019ve been having these consistent manufacturing challenges. They need to take action here.\u201d NBC said Minicucci told the network Alaska Airlines would continue to fly an all-Boeing fleet. In contrast, United appeared more unsure about its relationship with Boeing. United has 79 of the Max 9s, more than any other airline, and had originally scheduled nearly 8,000 flights with the plane for this month before the incident, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Boeing\u2019s future is uncertain regarding orders for the 737 Max 10, a newer, larger version and more expensive version of the 737 Max that has yet to be certified by the FAA. \u201cI think the Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for us,\u201d said Kirby. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build a plan that doesn\u2019t have the Max 10 in it.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore and Hanna Ziady contributed to this report.

            "text": "United Airlines, one of the biggest buyers of Boeing jets, is losing patience with the troubled aircraft maker. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that\u2026 this keeps happening at Boeing. This isn\u2019t new,\u201d said Scott Kirby, CEO of United, in an interview Tuesday on CNBC. \u201cWe need Boeing to succeed. But they\u2019ve been having these consistent manufacturing challenges. They need to take action here.\u201d Kirby made his comments after the airline warned investors that it will report a larger-than-expected loss in the first three months of this year because of the grounding of all 737 Max 9 jets after a door plug blew off on an Alaska Air flight on January 5, leaving a massive hole in the side of the plane. The plane landed without any serious injuries, but the Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding and additional inspections of the more than 200 jets of that model worldwide. United Airlines said it now expects its fleet of Boeing Max 9 jets to remain grounded through the end of this month, and that the company will report a first quarter loss in the range of $116 million to $262 million. That\u2019s more than the $138 million loss already forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. United has 79 of the Max 9s, more than any other airline, and had originally scheduled nearly 8,000 flights with the plane for this month before the incident, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Beyond the current 737 Max 9 problem is what this means for Boeing\u2019s orders for the 737 Max 10, a newer, larger version and more expensive version of the 737 Max that has yet to be certified by the FAA. It will be at least five years in a best case scenario before Boeing can delivery those Max 10 jets to United, Kirby said, and the airline is now no longer counting on getting that plane in the future. \u201cI think the Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for us,\u201d said Kirby. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build a plan that doesn\u2019t have the Max 10 in it.\u201d United has firm orders for 277 of the 737 Max 10, and options to buy an additional 200, and so if the airline were to pull out of those orders, it would be a massive blow for Boeing\u2019s efforts to bring that plane to market.  And in a call with investors later in the day, Kirby said that the airline is not quite canceling the orders that it has for the Max 10, but it doesn\u2019t anticipate it\u2019ll be receiving the jets, either. \u201cWe are taking it out of our internal plans,\u201d said Kirby. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll be working on what that means exactly with Boeing. But Boeing is not going to be able to meet their contractual deliveries on at least many of those airplanes. And let\u2019s leave it at that.\u201d United has orders for more than 500 Boeing jets in total on the books, more than twice as many as it does for jets from its rival Airbus. But in the last six months, United took delivery of its first A321neo, a model that directly competes with the Boeing 737 Max. But thanks to a deep order backlog at both companies, even if United were to drop its 737 Max 10 purchase plans, it would probably be forced to buy other 737 Max models rather than getting at the end of the line for buyers of Airbus jets. That will constrain the company for quite some time, Kirby added. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to be the fastest growing airline,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to be as fast growing as we planned.\u201d Boeing would not comment directly on United\u2019s comments on its orders, other than to once again apologize for the problems that led to the incident at Alaska Air and the subsequent 737 Max 9 grounding. \u201cWe have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers,\u201d said Stan Deal, head of Boeing\u2019s commercial aircraft unit, in a statement released by the company. \u201cWe are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance. We will follow the lead of the FAA and support our customers every step of the way.\u201d Boeing has had a series of quality issues that have dogged the aircraft maker for the last five years, ever since two fatal crashes of the 737 Max 8 in late 2018 and early 2019 led to a 20-month grounding of the jet. United believes it is getting close to the completion of the inspections it needs to get approval to fly the 737 Max 9 once again, Kirby said. \u201cI have a lot of confidence in the safety of these airplanes, particularly since we know what happened with this Max 9,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re near the end game of getting that [model] back flying.\u201d United did say it expects full year earnings of between $9 to $11 a share, a range which would include the current estimates of full-year earnings of $9.45 a share according to analysts, as well as 2023 earnings of $10.05 a share that it reported Monday. And it reported fourth-quarter earnings of $2.00 a share, topping the $1.69 a share forecast by analysts. The earnings beat and the full-year guidance helped to lift shares of United more than 5% in trading Tuesday.",

            "text": "(CNN) \u2014 The US Federal Aviation Administration has urged airlines to inspect so-called door plugs on an earlier version of Boeing 737 airplanes, after one blew out of the side of the newer Max model during an Alaska Airlines flight earlier this month. The FAA on Sunday said airlines operating the Boeing 737-900ER model should \u201cvisually inspect mid-exit door plugs to ensure the door is properly secured,\u201d referring to the panel that plugs the hole where a mid-plane exit would be. \u201cThe Boeing 737-900ER is not part of the newer Max fleet but has the same door plug design,\u201d the US aviation regulator added in what is known as a safety alert for operators. Boeing\u2019s shares fell almost 3% in premarket trade Monday. The safety alert on a plane that has been in service for almost two decades will deal a fresh blow to the company, which has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft in recent years, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and delayed deliveries of others. The planemaker\u2019s stock has declined about 14% since a door plug on one of its Max 9 airplanes shot out\u00a0from the side of the fuselage only a few minutes into a flight from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing. In a statement shared with CNN, Boeing said it \u201cfully\u201d supports the FAA and its own customers in the regulator\u2019s latest action. Since the terrifying incident just over two weeks ago, some airlines have inspected the earlier-built Boeing planes and observed \u201cfindings with bolts\u201d holding the door plugs in place, according to the FAA.\u00a0The regulator did not specify what the findings were. After recent inspections of the newer Max 9s, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines have also both found loose bolts. United, Delta Airlines and Alaska Airlines told CNN Monday that they had already started inspections of their Boeing 737-900ER aircraft and did not anticipate any disruptions to operations. \u201cWe have had no findings to date,\u201d Alaska Airlines said. According to data on Boeing\u2019s website, it has delivered a total of around 500 of these airplanes to carriers that also include Turkish Airlines. Alaska said in a statement it began inspecting its 737-900ER planes several days ago and had \u201cno findings\u201d so far. It expects to complete the remainder of its 737-900ER inspections without pulling the planes from service. The FAA notice does not ground the earlier generation of plane.\u00a0Instead, it recommends that airlines inspect the door plugs and the bolts \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d The newer Max 9 aircraft continue to be grounded in the United States.\u00a0The agency said it continued to review data collected from inspections of 40 sample aircraft as it considered how to determine if the planes were safe to fly again.

            "text": "Russia\u2019s aviation watchdog said on Sunday four people survived the crash of a charter plane bound for Moscow in northern Afghanistan, citing the Russian embassy there, and it said the condition of two other passengers on board was not yet clear. Two Taliban provincial officials said four survivors were now with Taliban administration officials who had reached the remote, mountainous site of the crash. They said that two other passengers had died. The Taliban administration\u2019s top spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the pilot of the plane was among four who had survived. \u201cThe investigative team of the Islamic Emirate continues their efforts to search for and provide assistance to the remaining individuals,\u201d he said in a statement. The Russian-registered charter plane with six people on board disappeared from radar screens over Afghanistan a day earlier, Russian aviation authority Rosaviatsia said on Sunday, after Afghan police said they had received reports of a crash. The plane was a charter ambulance flight travelling from Thailand\u2019s Utapao Airport in Pattaya to Moscow via India and Uzbekistan on a French-made Dassault Aviation,\u00a0Falcon 10 jet manufactured in 1978, Rosaviatsia said in a statement. About 25 minutes before the plane vanished from radar screens, the pilot warned that fuel was running low and that the plane would try to land at an airport in Tajikistan, Russian news outlet SHOT reported, citing an unnamed source. The pilot then reported that one engine had stopped, and then that the second one had also stopped, SHOT reported. Reuters could not immediately confirm the details shared by SHOT. India\u2019s civil aviation authority said the plane was not a scheduled commercial flight or an Indian chartered aircraft. The flight was carrying out a private medical evacuation from Thailand\u2019s Pattaya, a popular tourist destination for Russians, to Moscow, Russian state-run TASS news agency reported, citing the Russian embassy in Bangkok. \u201cOn board was a bedridden patient in serious condition, a Russian citizen, who was transported from one of the hospitals in Pattaya to Russia,\u201d the RIA news agency reported, citing a source at Thailand\u2019s Utapao International Airport. \u201cShe was accompanied by her husband, a private entrepreneur, also a Russian citizen, who paid for the flight.\u201d Several Russian media outlets said the passengers were a couple from Volgodonsk in southern Russia. A manifest list for the plane, published by the SHOT news outlet, appeared to show the crew were also Russian nationals. Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee said it had opened a criminal case to determine if safety rules had been violated. The plane\u2019s reported owner, a small Russian firm called Athletic Group LLC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Taliban-run Afghan aviation ministry said in a statement on X that the plane\u2019s planned route did not include passing through Afghanistan\u2019s air space and that \u201cprobably due to technical issues\u201d the plane had diverted from its planned route. The statement said a ministry technical team was investigating the matter. Afghanistan police had received reports of a plane crash in a remote, mountainous region of Badakhshan in Afghanistan\u2019s far north, a provincial police spokesperson said on Sunday. Zabihullah Amiri, a spokesperson for Badakhshan\u2019s provincial government, told Reuters a team had been sent to the location of the crash, a remote area more than 200 km (124 miles) from the provincial capital Fayzabad.",

            "text": "JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines filed an appeal late Friday of the federal court ruling from earlier this week that had blocked their proposed merger on antitrust grounds. The two-page appeal filed after the market close on Friday did not lay out any legal argument for the appeal. It simply notified the court that the two airlines would be going forward with their efforts to combine and form the nation\u2019s new fifth largest airline. The airlines had previously signaled they disagreed with the decision to block their merger. \u201cWe continue to believe that our combination is the best opportunity to increase much needed competition and choice by bringing low fares and great service to more customers in more markets while enhancing our ability to compete with the dominant U.S. carriers,\u201d said the two airlines on Tuesday following the decision. Shares of Spirit, which have lost most than half their value since the original court decision blocking the deal on Monday, jumped 10% in after-hours trading on news of the appeal. Meanwhile JetBlue shares fell 2%. Spirit shares had already closed up 17% in regular-hours trading Friday after Spirit had tried to assure investors that the decision blocking its purchase by JetBlue would not\u00a0force it out of business. Spirit was a pioneer in offering ultra-low base fares in the US market, but charging extra for virtually all other options, including carry-on bags. Its fares prompted major airlines to offer a certain number of no-frills \u201cbasic economy\u201d seats on their planes. It also prompted concerns that its purchase by JetBlue would lead to higher fares across the industry \u2014 concerns which resulted in the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust case that blocked the deal. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a victory for tens of millions of travelers who would have faced higher fares and fewer choices had the proposed merger between JetBlue and Spirit been allowed to move forward,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday following the decision. \u201cThe Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce the nation\u2019s antitrust laws to protect American consumers.\u201d A Justice Department spokesperson said it had no comment on the the airlines\u2019 appeal, which was not unexpected. Decades of airline mergers The US airline industry has gone through more than 20 years of mergers and consolidation before this deal was announced. The 10 major airlines that existed in 1999 have been\u00a0combined into four major carriers\u00a0\u2014 American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines \u2014 through a series of deals, often done as part of a bankruptcy proceeding. Those four large carriers carry about 80% of the nation\u2019s air traffic. The mergers have resulted in a much more profitable US airline industry, but far fewer choices for US air travelers, which can result in higher fares. The Biden administration has taken a much more aggressive approach in fighting mergers and combinations, including in the airline industry. Ahead of this deal it filed a federal lawsuit that challenged the alliance in the the Northeast United States between American and JetBlue. That alliance was dropped as JetBlue tried to win approval of its purchase of Spirit. But even without the deal being allowed to go forward, it is possible that Spirit could go away. A note by Cowen airline analyst Helane Becker late Wednesday speculated that Spirit could be forced to liquidate because aircraft leasing companies, which own more than half of Spirit\u2019s 200-plus Airbus jets, would be more likely to repossess the planes and find other customers rather than to negotiate new financing terms. The note said that many of those aircaft could be purchased for use overseas by foreign carriers, which could reduce US capacity if it were to occur, and put further upward pressure on airfares beyond what would occur if Spirit were to merge with JetBlue. \u201cWe recognize this sounds alarmist and harsh, but the reality is we believe there are limited scenarios that enable Spirit to restructure,\u201d Becker wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. \u201cWe believe Spirit will first look for an alternative buyer, but another airline may get the same pushback [from antitrust regulators.]\u201d Other analysts didn\u2019t predict bankruptcy or liquidation, but still forecast a difficult course for Spirit trying to make it on its own. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s airline analysts wrote in a note that while \u201cwe are not (yet) predicting an immediate\u201d bankruptcy filing by Spirit, \u201cwe can not reasonably identify a viable return to profitability any time soon.\u201d But the JPMorgan analysts\u2019 note suggests that JetBlue would be better off if the appeal fails and the deal does not go through. The note about Tuesday\u2019s decision included the headline, \u201cJetBlue Dodges a bullet.\u201d The analysts said that while JetBlue was still interested in expanding through acquiring Spirit\u2019s aircraft and pilots, it might want to walk away from the $3.8 billion deal as originally crafted. \u201cWe believe JetBlue was wholly unprepared (or unwilling) to proceed with the originally-crafted deal economics (the price was simply just too much to pay),\u201d the JPMorgan analysts wrote on Tuesday. And the analysts said they believe the appeal will prove unsuccessful, and that JetBlue would file the appeal because it was legally bound to do so under terms of the purchase agreement. \u201cWe have no reason to believe its expected (contractual) appeal will alter the outcome,\u201d they wrote. Spirit losses to continue Spirit said in the earlier Friday filing that it expects to beat analysts\u2019 expectations for the end of the year. But that doesn\u2019t mean a profit \u2014 it just means the company believes it will lose less money than predicted in the fourth quarter, which would still leave it in a worse position than the fourth quarter of 2022, when it was narrowly profitable. The company also wants to refinance $1.1 billion in debt due in September 2025. In its guidance Friday, Spirit Airlines said its revenue should come in at $1.32 billlion, a bit better than the forecast of $1.31 billion. It put its operating losses between $158 million to $172 million, down from the $178 million operating loss in the third quarter, and better than forecasts of a $197 million loss. But the quarter will still be worse than the fourth quarter of a year ago when it had revenue of $13.9 billion and an adjusted operating profit of $58 million. All US airlines were\u00a0hemorrhaging billions\u00a0during the first two years of the pandemic, despite receiving billions of dollars of federal assistance to keep flying and prevent widespread layoffs. But as demand for air travel bounced back in 2022, so did\u00a0profitability at the larger carriers. But smaller carriers \u2014 like Spirit \u2014 that offer lower fares to attract bargain-hunting leisure travelers have continued to struggle. Following $1 billion in losses in 2020 and 2021, the company lost $264 million in the first nine months of 2023, in addition to the loss it is due to report next month for the fourth\ufeff quarter. It is forecast to lose another $310 million in losses this year, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.",

            "text": "Spirit Airlines could end up in bankruptcy and be forced out of business because of a federal court decision to block a proposed sale to JetBlue Airways, according to a note from an airline analyst. Unlike many airline bankruptcies, in which the airline in bankruptcy court either sheds debt and emerges a financially healthier company or ends up being purchased by another carrier and merged into its operations, the more likely scenario for Spirit would be a liquidation of its assets, according to a note from Helane Becker, an analyst with Cowen. \u201cWe recognize this sounds alarmist and harsh, but the reality is we believe there are limited scenarios that enable Spirit to restructure,\u201d she wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. \u201cWe believe Spirit will first look for an alternative buyer, but another airline may get the same pushback [from antitrust regulators.]\u201d Spirit was a pioneer in offering ultra-low base fares in the US market, but charging extra for virtually all other options, including carry-on bags. Its fares prompted major airlines to offer a certain number of no-frills \u201cbasic economy\u201d seats on their planes. It also prompted concerns that its purchase by JetBlue would lead to higher fares across the industry \u2014 concerns which resulted in the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust case that blocked the deal. But if Becker is right, Spirit could still disappear. And if that happens it could lead to criticism of the Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s action to block the deal, and statements from Attorney General Merrick Garland and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg praising the decision. \u201cAfter decades of airline consolidation, this ruling demonstrates the importance of putting competition first,\u201d Buttigieg posted on X Wednesday. \u201cThis administration is holding the line on competition in order to support better consumer choice and lower airfares.\u201d All US airlines were hemorrhaging billions during the first two years of the pandemic, despite receiving billions of dollars of federal assistance to keep flying and prevent widespread layoffs. But as demand for air travel bounced back in 2022, so did profitability at the larger carriers. But smaller carriers \u2014 like Spirit \u2014 that offer lower fares to attract bargain-hunting leisure travelers have continued to struggle. Following $1 billion in losses in 2020 and 2021, the company lost $264 million in the first nine months of 2023. It is forecast to lose another $175 million for the final three months of 2023, and an additional $310 million in losses this year, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Spirit has $1.1 billion in debt coming due in September 2025. In a note Wednesday, Fitch said it will face challenges being able to refinance that debt. \u201cSpirit faces significant refinancing risk in the next year,\u201d said the note from Fitch, which already had Spirit on watch from a downgrade from its current junk bond rating of B. \u201cMeanwhile, the company faces serious headwinds toward improving its profitability including engine availability issues, overcapacity in certain leisure markets, and intense competition.\u201d Not all analysts see a bankruptcy and liquidation in Spirit\u2019s future, but many were cautioning that its financial outlook remains grim. \u201cWe are not (yet) predicting an immediate [Spirit] chapter 11 filing,\u201d said the airline analysts at JPMorgan Chase, referring to the bankruptcy code used in such filings. But, they added, \u201cwe can not reasonably identify a viable return to profitability any time soon.\u201d Spirit did not directly comment on Becker\u2019s analysis but said it is confident it will be able to survive the current problems. \u201cWhile we are disappointed with this [court decision] outcome, we are confident in our strengths and strategy,\u201d said a company statement sent to CNN. \u201cWe remain committed to delivering affordable fares and great service to our guests and providing excellent opportunities to our team members. Spirit has been taking, and will continue to take, prudent steps to ensure the strength of its balance sheet and ongoing operations.\u201d The bankruptcy process is designed to allow money losing companies to shed debt and other expenses they can\u2019t afford and remain in business. Many companies, including most of the nation\u2019s major airlines, have gone bankrupt and went on to record profits in the future. But Becker said it\u2019s unlikely that Spirit will be able to renegotiate its deals, particularly with the aircraft leasing companies that own many of its planes, which are all single-aisle jets made by Airbus. With demand for those jets currently strong, the leasing companies that own the jets are much more inclined to simply repossess them from an airline that can\u2019t pay, rather than negotiate with them on a lower price. \u201cDemand for narrowbody aircraft are at a premium, especially given ongoing issues at Boeing and lessors would be more likely to repossess aircraft than renegotiate leases,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn fact, JetBlue could lease in Spirit\u2019s aircraft from lessors during the company\u2019s likely restructuring.\u201d Shares of Spirit, which fell 47% in trading on Tuesday following the court decision, lost another 22% in trading Wednesday following Becker\u2019s note and were down more than 20% in trading Thursday. Combined that represents a loss of more than two-thirds of their value so far this week. In a decision announced Tuesday, Federal Judge William Young agreed with the Justice Department\u2019s arguments that allowing JetBlue to purchase Spirit would violate antitrust laws and reduce downward pressure of fares that Spirit\u2019s business model had brought to the US airline industry. \u201cThe court has made its best attempt\u2026 to predict the future of a dynamic market recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, in markedly uncertain times,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe proposed acquisition would eliminate Spirit as a competitor to all other airlines in the market, resulting in less pressure on all other airlines to compete.\u201d JetBlue and Spirit issued a joint statement following the decision saying they were considering whether or not to appeal the decision. \u201cWe continue to believe that our combination is the best opportunity to increase much needed competition and choice by bringing low fares and great service to more customers in more markets while enhancing our ability to compete with the dominant U.S. carriers,\u201d JetBlue and Spirit said in a joint emailed statement to CNN. \u201cWe are reviewing the court\u2019s decision and are evaluating our next steps as part of the legal process.\u201d",

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. It\u2019s been a tough month for shares of airline companies. The NYSE Arca Airline index, which tracks the performance of major American and overseas airlines, has slide 15% so far this month, underperforming the benchmark S&P 500 index, which is down by 0.6%. Here\u2019s why investors are getting out of airline stocks. Boeing\u2019s \u201ccan of worms\u201d: Boeing\u2019s problems began on Jan. 5, when the door plug on an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 detached mid-flight. The fallout from the incident has spread across the airline industry. Hundreds of flights have been canceled. A class action lawsuit was filed on Jan. 11 in Washington state against Boeing on behalf of the Alaska Airlines passengers. The US Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating. Then, Wells Fargo analysts on Tuesday downgraded Boeing to \u201cequal weight\u201d from \u201coverweight,\u201d which is the equivalent of a \u201cbuy\u201d rating, citing concerns that the FAA\u2019s investigation opossf the aircraft manufacturer could reveal some damning findings. \u201cGiven Boeing\u2019s recent track record, and greater incentive for the FAA to find problems, we think the odds of a clean audit are low,\u201d the analysts wrote. \u201cThe FAA\u2019s audit is limited to Max 9 for now, but it\u2019s feasible that findings could expand the scope to other Max models sharing common parts.\u201d Shares of Boeing have fallen 22% this month. Spirit Airlines and JetBlue\u2019s blocked merger: Spirit Airlines shares took a hit on Tuesday after a federal judge in Boston ruled against JetBlue\u2019s proposed $3.8 billion acquisition of the discount airline. Both airlines said they disagree with the ruling. \u201cWe are reviewing the court\u2019s decision and are evaluating our next steps as part of the legal process,\u201d JetBlue and Spirit said in a joint emailed statement to CNN. Spirit Airlines shares have tanked about 63% this month. JetBlue shares rose following the ruling, but are still down about 16% for the month. The US Justice Department sued in March to stop the deal, the first time in more than 20 years that the government has sought to block a US airline merger. Some investors appear worried about another proposed US airline merger: the $1.9 billion deal to combine Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines. Shares of Hawaiian Holdings have slipped about 5% this month. Oil prices are volatile: Investors are also concerned about a possible spike in oil prices. Crude prices jumped briefly after US-led strikes on Iran-backed Houthi targets in Yemen after repeated attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea raised concerns about a broader conflict that could curtail oil supply from the Middle East. But Brent crude futures, the global benchmark for oil, settled back at $77.88 a barrel on Wednesday. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the US benchmark, settled at $72.56 a barrel. Both are down over the past month. The read-through to airline stocks? In the event of further escalation of the conflict in the Middle East, higher oil prices could push up the price of fuel, eating into airline companies\u2019 bottom lines. Earnings warnings: Delta Air Lines last Friday beat Wall Street expectations for its latest quarter but worried investors when it trimmed its 2024 earnings outlook. The company projected adjusted earnings between $6 and $7 per share for the year, down from the more than $7 it previously forecast. The company also said that it continues to see supply chain issues stemming from global disruptions during the Covid pandemic, particularly with securing parts and repairs. \u201cAll the suppliers in our industry lost a tremendous amount of experience due to the pandemic and have taken time to get that back,\u201d CEO Ed Bastian said Friday on the company\u2019s earnings call. Delta shares declined following the release of its earnings and are down about 8% for the month to date. Other major carriers\u2019 stocks followed suit. United Airlines Holdings shares have declined 8% so far in January and American Airlines Group shares have fallen 6%. Secretary Blinken\u2019s Boeing 737 out of Davos had a critical failure. He had to switch planes Secretary of State Antony Blinken was forced to change planes to return to Washington from Davos after his plane suffered what the traveling press was told was a critical failure related to an oxygen leak. Blinken and the traveling party boarded the modified Boeing 737 jet in Zurich on Wednesday after a day and a half of meetings at the global summit in Davos, reports CNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler. The plane suffered the issue after boarding, and the party was forced to deplane, according to traveling press. This is just the latest blow to Boeing\u2019s once stellar, now badly tarnished reputation. Read more here. US retail sales rose at a faster pace in December Americans spent at a faster clip in December, closing out a year of surprising economic resilience largely driven by the US consumer, reports my colleague Bryan Mena. Spending at US retailers rose 0.6% in December from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. That was a much stronger pace than November\u2019s 0.3% gain, and it also beat economists\u2019 expectations. Retail sales are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation. Sales at department stores jumped 3% in December, the most of any category. Spending at car dealerships, clothing stores and online also increased at a solid pace last month. The latest figures also show that American retailers had a strong holiday season. Meanwhile, sales at gas stations, furniture stores and personal-care shops declined in December. Spending is heavily influenced by the state of the labor market, and Wednesday\u2019s report coincides with government data showing that employers continued to hire at a solid clip last month as the unemployment rate held steady at a low 3.7%. US consumers have also been racking up debt over the past year. Read more here.",

            "text": "Boeing says its CEO told workers of Spirit AeroSystems \u2014 its subcontractor that builds the 737 Max 9 fuselage \u2014 that \u201cwe\u2019re going to learn from\u201d this month\u2019s blowout on Alaska Airlines flight 1282. Boeing says CEO Dave Calhoun addressed 200 Spirit AeroSystems employees as part of a town hall meeting held in Wichita, Kansas, on Wednesday. Alongside Calhoun was Spirit AeroSystems President and CEO Pat Shanahan, Boeing says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get better,\u201d a Boeing news release says Calhoun told employees. \u201cNot because the two of us are talking, but because the engineers at Boeing, the\u00a0mechanics at Boeing, the inspectors at Boeing, the engineers at Spirit, the\u00a0mechanics at Spirit, the inspectors at Spirit. They\u2019re going to speak the same language on this in every way, shape or form.\u201d Earlier Wednesday, the Federal Aviation Administration specifically named Spirit AeroSystems for the first time as part of its investigation into Boeing\u2019s quality control, triggered by this month\u2019s Alaska Airlines incident. Investigators are determining why a door plug, which is supposed to cover up a space left by a removed emergency exit door in the side of the plane, blew off Alaska Airlines flight 1282 on January 5 and\u00a0left a gaping hole\u00a0in the side of the plane. The Boeing 737 Max 9 remains grounded in the United States until the FAA releases a final directive on how airlines should conduct ungrounding inspections on 171 airplanes. The FAA said Wednesday it has received new data from preliminary inspections of 40 of those airplanes, and once it approves an inspection and maintenance process, it will require every airline with 737-9 Max planes to complete that inspection before the planes can return to the skies. Alaska Airlines said Thursday it is cancelling all Boeing 737 Max 9 flights through Sunday as it continues to wait for the FAA to issue the final directive for ungrounding the planes. In a Thursday update posted to its website, Alaska Airlines says the grounding of its 65 Max 9s \u201ccontinues to have a tremendous impact on our operation,\u201d causing the cancelation of 110 to 150 flights per day. Alaska Airlines says its techs have finished early inspections of some of its Max 9 jets and shared that information with Boeing who in turn is sharing it with the FAA Spirit AeroSystems is a major Boeing contractor that builds the fuselages of several Boeing jets, including the 737 Max. But the Alaska Airlines incident is not the first time that there have been problems with the quality of its work causing problems for Boeing planes. In April Boeing announced that a \u201cnon-standard manufacturing process\u201d discovered during the installation of two fittings in the rear fuselage made by Spirit AeroSystems for the 737 Max caused delays in deliveries and production and required additional inspection by its airline customers. The FAA allowed the planes that had been delivered to keep flying in that instance. The supplier used to be part of Boeing but Boeing spun-off its Wichita division and Oklahoma operations into Spirit AeroSystems. While the company now has customers other than Boeing, it is by far its largest customer, accounting for 62% of its revenue during the first nine months of this year.

            "text": "Boeing is getting some respite from what has been a month of terrible news. India\u2019s newest airline is purchasing 150 Boeing 737 Max aircraft, in the first major order the troubled planemaker has announced since the dramatic Alaska Airlines incident in which\u00a0part of the fuselage of a 737 Max 9 fell off\u00a0mid-flight. Akasa Air has ordered the 737 Max 10 and 737 Max 8-200 aircraft to be delivered through 2032, the airline said at an event in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad. The order does not include Max 9 planes, which have been grounded by US regulators since the in-flight blowout. Boeing said the order was finalized in December. \u201cThe efficiency and versatility of the 737-10 and 737-8-200 will support Akasa Air\u2019s expansion to meet soaring demand for air travel in the region for many years to come,\u201d Stephanie Pope, Boeing\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a statement on Thursday. Earlier this month, an Alaska Airlines flight carrying 177 people made an emergency landing shortly after takeoff\u00a0from Portland, Oregon, after part of the wall of the new aircraft detached and left a gaping hole in\u00a0the side of the plane. It\u2019s a huge new blow for the reputation of the 737 Max, which was grounded for 20 months after crashes in 2018 in Indonesia and early 2019 in Ethopia killed all 346 people on board the flights. Boeing\u2019s (BA) shares have plunged almost 20% this month. Analysts at Wells Fargo this week warned that the ongoing investigation into the Alaska Airlines incident will open \u201ca whole new can of worms\u201d for the aircraft manufacturer, which has been facing quality control and engineering problems for years. On Wednesday, the US Federal Aviation Administration said it was expanding its probe to include Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), which builds the fuselage of the 737 Max 9. In another high-profile embarrassment for Boeing this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was forced to change planes to return to Washington from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, after his modified Boeing 737 plane suffered what the traveling press was told was a critical failure related to an oxygen leak. At the airshow in India, Vinay Dube, the founder and CEO of Akasa Air, said his airline  pursues \u201cthe highest standards of safety in global aviation.\u201d \u201cThis large and historic aircraft order puts Akasa on a path of becoming one of the top 30 leading airlines in the world, by the turn of this decade,\u201d he added. Akasa Air, which was launched in 2022, is not the only Indian carrier that is buying a lot of Boeing planes. Last year, Air India said it would buy 220 Boeing planes. That order, one of the largest in Boeing\u2019s history, was announced by President Joe Biden after a call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India\u2019s aviation market is growing at a rapid pace, and Modi\u2019s government believes it can become the world\u2019s largest by 2047.",

            "text": "Secretary of State Antony Blinken was forced to change planes to return to Washington from Davos after his plane suffered what the traveling press was told was a critical failure related to an oxygen leak. Blinken and the traveling party boarded the modified Boeing 737 jet in Zurich on Wednesday after a day and a half of meetings at the global summit in Davos. The plane suffered the issue after boarding and the party was forced to deplane, according to traveling press. A new, smaller aircraft was being sent for Blinken, and many in the traveling party will now be returning to Washington commercially, according to the traveling press. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller on Wednesday said the plane suffered a mechanical issue. He said Blinken was still expected to be back in Washington Wednesday evening, and referred further questions to the US Air Force. This is just the latest blow to Boeing\u2019s once stellar, now badly tarnished reputation. On Jan. 5 an Alaska Airlines jet had a door plug blow out shortly after takeoff when the plane was at 16,000 feet, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet. Fortunately no one was sitting in the seat next to the hole, and no was seriously injured. But the incident led to the temporary grounding of all 737 Max 9 jets as airlines were ordered to inspect them for possible faulty assembly and loose or missing bolts. While a cause of that accident is still under investigation, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun has acknowledge a \u201cmistake\u201d by Boeing led to the incident. That Alaska Air plane is a newer version of the 737 than the one that Blinken had been set to ride on, which is an older model modified for use by the military. But the newer version of the 737, the 737 Max, has had a series of serious problems long before the Alaska Air incident this month. Two crashes of the 737 Max, in 2018 in Indonesia and early 2019 in Ethopia, killed all 346 people on board the flights, and led to a 20-month grounding of the jet while Boeing worked to come up with a fix to the design flaw that caused the crashes. But it has had other quality issues since returning to service beyond the Alaska Air incident. Just this past December Boeing asked airlines to inspect all of their 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system, which is crucial to control of the plane in the air, after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft. In recent years the aircraft maker also has had quality issues that led to a halt in deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner while its 777 jet was also temporarily grounded jets suffered engine failure, sending debris\u00a0crashing down over Denver.

            "text": "Investigators probing why part of a Boeing 737 Max 9 blew open mid-flight earlier this month have not yet determined if bolts were installed on that piece of the aircraft. National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told reporters after a closed-door briefing for lawmakers Wednesday that the investigation into is ongoing. Investigators are determining why a door plug, which is supposed to cover up a space left by a removed emergency exit door in the side of the plane, blew off Alaska Airlines flight 1282 on January 5 and left a gaping hole in the side of the plane. She said the investigation is not solely focused on the bolts, and her teams are currently collecting extensive records on the assembly of the door plug and its journey from Malaysia, where it was first built, to factories in Wichita, Kansas and Renton, Washington. \u00a0It was unclear, she said, whether Boeing employees removed the plug from the airplane fuselage when it arrived in Renton from its subcontractor, Spirit Areosystems. Scientists in the NTSB\u2019s lab are currently scrutinizing the plug but have not yet started disassembling it, she said. \u201cThey have very bright lighting.\u00a0 They\u2019re doing targeted photography,\u201d Homendy said.\u00a0 \u201cThey might take some metal shavings and put them under the electron microscope.\u201d Then next week, NTSB officials will begin pulling the door plug apart to further examine its construction. Homendy said she and the head of the Federal Aviation Administration, who participated in the Senate Commerce Committee briefing virtually, have been talking once or twice most days. Expanded probe The FAA announced Wednesday that it is expanding its probe into Boeing 737 Max 9 quality control following this month\u2019s in-flight blowout. In a new statement, the FAA says it is now investigating contractor Spirit AeroSystems, which builds the fuselage of the Boeing 737 Max 9. The FAA last week\u00a0opened an investigation\u00a0into Boeing\u2019s quality control after the Alaska Airlines incident. The FAA says the investigation will focus on whether Boeing \u201cfailed to ensure completed products conformed to its approved design and were in a condition for safe operation in compliance with FAA regulations.\u201d Boeing said it \u201cwill cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA and the NTSB on their investigations\u201d in a statement last Thursday. Spirit Aerosystems did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FAA says all 171 Boeing 737 Max 9s in the United States remain grounded, the agency has received new data from preliminary inspections of 40 of those airplanes. \u201cThe first 40 inspections that are part of that process are now complete, and the FAA will thoroughly review the data from them,\u201d the FAA said in a statement. \u201cOnce the FAA approves an inspection and maintenance process, it will be required on every grounded 737-9 Max prior to future operation.\u201d To help restore confidence in its manufacturing, Boeing said Monday it will allow airlines into Boeing factories and those of Spirit AeroSystems. Spirit Aerosystems\u2019 history of trouble Shareholders of Spirit AeroSystems last year filed a federal lawsuit against the company, accusing it of \u201cwidespread and sustained quality failures\u201d in its products. The suit states that quality failures, which have allegedly ranged from debris in products to missing fasteners and peeling paint, led Boeing to place Spirit on probation from around 2018 to at least 2021.\u00a0The suit, which was previously reported by the publication The Lever, does not specifically mention door plugs. The suit claims that \u201cconstant quality failures resulted in part from Spirit\u2019s culture which prioritized production numbers and short-term financial outcomes over product quality, and Spirit\u2019s related failure to hire sufficient personnel to deliver quality products at the rates demanded by Spirit and its customers including Boeing.\u201d The suit further states that a former Spirit AeroSystems employee who worked as a quality manager and inspector\u00a0and who was not named in the suit wrote an ethics complaint to the company in 2022 that described an \u201cexcessive amount of defects\u201d in products. The former employee believes \u201cSpirit treats moving products down the line as more important than quality,\u201d according to the suit. A spokesperson for Spirit AeroSystems,\u00a0Joe Buccino,\u00a0said in a statement last week that\u00a0\u201cSpirit strongly disagrees with the assertions made by plaintiffs in the amended complaint and intends to vigorously defend against the claims. Spirit will not comment further as to the pending litigation.\u201d In April, Spirit AeroSystems\u00a0identified\u00a0a production issue on the aft fuselage section of certain\u00a0737\u00a0models. \u201cThis is not an immediate safety of flight issue. We have processes in place to address these of types of production issues upon identification, which we are following,\u201d the company then said in a statement. In August, the company\u00a0disclosed\u00a0improper holes drilled on the \u201caft pressure bulkhead\u201d on some models of the\u00a0737\u00a0fuselage. Both Spirit and Boeing said in\u00a0statements\u00a0that the issue was determined not to be an immediate flight-safety concern. This story has been updated with additional developments and context",

            "text": "Dubai is set to add another towering figure to its skyline. The Aeternitas Tower, officially unveiled at a launch event last week, will be the world\u2019s tallest residential clock tower at a staggering 450 meters (1,476 feet) tall \u2014 more than four times the height of London\u2019s Big Ben, and just 22 meters (72 feet) short of the world\u2019s tallest residential building, the Central Park Tower in New York City. Set to become the world\u2019s second-tallest clock tower (after the Makkah Clock Royal Tower in Mecca, Saudi Arabia), Aeternitas Tower is the result of a partnership between Dubai-based real estate developer London Gate and Swiss luxury watch manufacturer Franck Muller. London Gate purchased the plot of land in Dubai Marina, which already had the beginnings of an unfinished 106-story structure \u2014 and knew that the tower\u2019s monumental size needed a striking facade, said Tom Hill, media relations coordinator for the developer. \u201cWe believe the clock will be seen from six kilometers away because of the sheer height of the building,\u201d said Hill, adding that the clock face will be an enormous 40 meters (131 feet) tall and 30 meters (98 feet) wide. \u201cWe wanted to do something different that hasn\u2019t been done before in Dubai,\u201d said Hill. A timeless tower The residential tower comprises 649 units, with a mix of one- to three-bedroom apartments, in addition to villa and mansion duplexes. With housekeeping, a concierge service, and a 24-hour valet and porter, residents will have access to hotel-like services and facilities, but with the privacy and comfort of home. Its shared amenities range from health facilities, including a gym, padel court, spa, yoga studio, and swimming pool, to arts and culture spaces such as a cinema, music room, and library. The project will be handed over to residents in 2027, according to London Gate. The tower\u2019s name means \u201ceternity\u201d in Latin, and is inspired by the Franck Muller Aeternitas watch collection \u2014 one of the brand\u2019s most complex designs which features an \u201ceternal calendar,\u201d said Erol Baliyan, managing director of\u00a0Franck Muller\u00a0in the Middle East and Africa. The Swiss watchmaker sees its step into real estate as a move that will help create a monument that \u201cmirrors the brand\u2019s innovation, craftsmanship, and timeless elegance,\u201d said Baliyan. Aside from the striking clock face (inspired by Franck Muller\u2019s art deco-style Long Island Collection, which has irregular squashed and stretched numbers in a rectangular case), the watchmaker will infuse its design ethos throughout the residence, said Baliyan. He highlights luxury materials like brushed and polished metals, that will be contrasted with marble surfaces, textured fabrics and bold colors. Meanwhile, in the lobby and reception, the signature oblong face of the brand\u2019s Curvex watch is represented with curved walls, archways, and oval furnishings. \u201cAttention to detail is paramount, with meticulously crafted joinery and carefully arranged lighting and furniture, ensuring a refined ambiance,\u201d said Baliyan. A booming market The Aeternitas Tower is part of a growing trend in Dubai. Luxury property is booming in the Emirate, and branded residences \u2014 collaborations between designer brands and property developers \u2014 are surging in popularity. As of October 2023, there were 51 completed projects in the city, a figure that is expected to double by 2030, according to Savills Research, with brands like fashion house Karl Lagerfeld, car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz, and hoteliers 25Hours all announcing residential projects in the past year. London Gate began phase one of its sales last week, with one-bedroom apartments starting at AED 1.6 million ($435,600). \u201cWe\u2019ve had an unbelievable level of interest since the launch,\u201d said Hill, adding that in the first two days, London Gate sold around 30% of the initial 30-floor release, including all the available one-bedroom apartments. Hill believes that one factor driving interest is the tower\u2019s location in Dubai Marina, where there\u2019s a scarcity of sites for development, adding that an \u201ciconic tower\u201d like the Aeternitas is the first project of its kind to break ground in the district past few years. While this is London Gate\u2019s first branded residence project, it won\u2019t be its last, said Hill, adding that the company will announce its next branded partnership by the end of Q1 this year. As a rapidly evolving market, property in Dubai is often sold off-plan, with buyers waiting years to see their purchase. This is where branded residences provide an extra layer of security, particularly for overseas buyers, said Hill. \u201cWhen you have a brand as world-renowned as Franck Muller, for example [\u2026] you have that peace of mind that you\u2019re going to be handed over a world-class product,\u201d he added.",

            "text": "As if Boeing needed any more bad news, a scathing report from Wall Street on Tuesday cast doubt on Boeing\u2019s ability to pass a new federal safety audit, sending its stock sinking sharply. Later Tuesday, Boeing announced an independent adviser who will lead a review of the company\u2019s quality control. The Wells Fargo report, entitled \u201cFAA audit opens up a whole new can of worms,\u201d noted that Boeing\u2019s quality control and engineering problems have been ongoing for years. After part of an Alaska Airlines] 737 Max 9 jet fell off the plane mid-flight, the likelihood of the US Federal Aviation Administration coming out of its investigation without significant findings was very low. \u201cGiven Boeing\u2019s recent track record, and greater incentive for the FAA to find problems, we think the odds of a clean audit are low,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cThe FAA\u2019s audit is limited to Max 9 for now, but it\u2019s feasible that findings could expand the scope to other Max models sharing common parts.\u201d The analysts believe the investigation increases significantly the risk that Boeing takes a hit to its production and deliveries, and they downgraded the stock to \u201cequal weight,\u201d down from \u201coverweight,\u201d the equivalent of a \u201cbuy\u201d rating. Boeing\u2019s (BA) stock tumbled 8% on the report. The FAA last week opened an investigation into Boeing\u2019s quality control after the Alaska Airlines incident. The regulator said the dramatic in-flight blowout on Alaska Airlines 1282 \u201cshould have never happened and it cannot happen again.\u201d The door plug, which is supposed to cover up a space left by a removed emergency exit door in the side of the plane, blew off the aircraft and left a gaping hole in the side of the plane. The force of the explosive decompression and subsequent high-speed airflow inside the cabin ripped headrests off seats as the plane flew at 16,000 feet shortly after taking off from Portland, Oregon, carrying 177 people. Some passengers were injured, but in an extraordinary stroke of good luck, no one was seated next to the door plug, and there were no fatalities. The FAA says the investigation will focus on whether Boeing \u201cfailed to ensure completed products conformed to its approved design and were in a condition for safe operation in compliance with FAA regulations.\u201d Boeing declined to comment Tuesday, but said it \u201cwill cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA and the NTSB on their investigations\u201d in a statement last Thursday. Boeing turns to former military leader To help respond to those investigations, Boeing is naming an independent adviser to review quality control on its commercial airplane production lines. Boeing Tuesday said a team of outside experts headed by retired US Navy Admiral Kirkland H. Donald \u201cwill conduct a thorough assessment\u00a0of Boeing\u2019s quality management system for commercial airplanes.\u201d The company is following through after announcing last week it would bring an outside adviser to help assess its quality control. Boeing says Donald and his team will also look at \u201cquality programs and practices\u201d in Boeing factories as well as those of Boeing\u2019s suppliers, reporting their findings back to Boeing\u2019s board of directors. In a statement, Boeing CEO David Calhoun said the review will \u201cprovide an\u00a0independent and comprehensive assessment with actionable recommendations for strengthening our oversight of quality in our own factories and throughout our extended commercial airplane production system.\u201d The company would be \u201ctaking a hard look at our quality practices in our factories and across our production system,\u201d said Stan Deal, the Boeing executive who oversees its commercial airplane division, on Monday. Ahead of today\u2019s move, Deal wrote in a memo to employees obtained by CNN that the company would be performing more inspections of each 737 before they are delivered. He also said Boeing is now more closely monitoring the work of a key supplier that builds the 737 Max fuselage. Last week, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said he was considering requiring \u201can independent third party to oversee Boeing\u2019s inspections and its quality system.\u201d Boeing\u2019s mistake A week ago, Calhoun acknowledged the company\u2019s \u201cmistake\u201d at a staff-wide \u201csafety meeting,\u201d but he did not specify what that mistake was. National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy has demanded Boeing provide answers about any mistake it made as part of its safety investigation, which is separate from the FAA\u2019s audit. Although the investigation is ongoing, and it remains unclear what caused the door plug to blow off the plane, two airlines with a large number of 737 Max 9 planes in service \u2014 Alaska Airlines and United Airlines \u2014 said they found either loose hardware or bolts in the assembly of door plugs on their aircraft. United says its discovery pointed to possible installation issues. In a letter to Boeing last week, the FAA gave the company 10 days to supply any information on the cause of the Alaska Airlines incident. It also wants to know what actions Boeing has taken to prevent it from happening again. Wells Fargo analysts noted in their report that the FAA investigation could take some time to complete, noting many of its probes remain \u201cunder investigation\u201d months after the original incidents. All 737 Max 9 planes remain grounded as the FAA works to approve Boeing\u2019s inspection criteria for airlines to assess the safety of the aircraft. The regulator has not provided a timeline of when the planes might return to service. Alaska and United have canceled more than 100 flights a day as they await an all-clear from the FAA. A history of quality control problems Boeing has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft for five years now, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and the halt in deliveries of others. The 737 Max\u2019s design was found to be responsible for two fatal crashes: one in Indonesia in October 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019. Together, the\u00a0two crashes killed all 346 people\u00a0aboard the two flights and led to a\u00a020-month grounding\u00a0of the company\u2019s best-selling jets, which\u00a0cost it more than $21 billion. Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as \u201cdesigned by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.\u201d Late last month, Boeing asked airlines to\u00a0inspect all of their 737 Max jets\u00a0for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft. Its quality and engineering problems have extended beyond the 737. Boeing also had to twice halt deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, for\u00a0about a year\u00a0starting in 2021\u00a0and again in 2023, due to quality concerns cited by the FAA.\u00a0And the\u00a0777 jet\u00a0also suffered a grounding after an engine failure on a United flight\u00a0scattered engine debris\u00a0onto homes and the ground below. Two Max variants \u2014 the Max 7 and the Max 10 \u2014 are still awaiting approval to begin carrying passengers. This latest incident complicates that, Wells Fargo analysts noted. \u201cThe Max 7 and Max 10 variants\u2026 are now likely to receive greater scrutiny,\u201d they said. \u201cThis includes a required safety waiver that, while probably reasonable, looks politically difficult to grant given recent events.\u201d CNN\u2019s Pete Muntean, Chris Isidore and Ramishah Maruf contributed to this report.",

            "text": "Spirit Airlines shares tanked 47% on Tuesday after a federal judge in Boston ruled against JetBlue\u2019s proposed $3.8 billion acquisition of the discount airline. The ruling outlined several concerns, including increased fares for flyers, particularly for discount airlines Spirit\u2019s customers and significant debt for JetBlue (JBLU). JetBlue and Spirit told CNN that they disagree with the ruling. \u201cWe continue to believe that our combination is the best opportunity to increase much needed competition and choice by bringing low fares and great service to more customers in more markets while enhancing our ability to compete with the dominant U.S. carriers,\u201d JetBlue and Spirit said in a joint emailed statement to CNN. \u201cWe are reviewing the court\u2019s decision and are evaluating our next steps as part of the legal process.\u201d JetBlue shares gained 4.9% on Tuesday afternoon. The US Justice Department sued in March to halt the deal, marking the first time in\u00a0more than 20 years\u00a0that the government has sought to block a US airline merger. The Biden administration has argued since taking office there needs to be greater competition between businesses, especially in the\u00a0airline industry, to lower costs for consumers. Spirit\u00a0(SAVE), with its\u00a0low base fare business model\u00a0that charges customers extra for everything, including carry-on bags, prompts larger carriers to offer a percentage of their seats at the lowest possible price. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a victory for tens of millions of travelers who would have faced higher fares and fewer choices had the proposed merger between JetBlue and Spirit been allowed to move forward,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cThe Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce the nation\u2019s antitrust laws to protect American consumers.\u201d JetBlue\u00a0argued that the deal would create a new, stronger competitor to those four larger airlines and work to bring down fares, not increase them. The US airline industry has gone through more than 20 years of mergers and consolidation before this deal was announced. The 10 major airlines that existed in 1999 have been\u00a0combined into four major carriers\u00a0\u2014 American Airlines, United, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines \u2014 through a series of deals, often done as part of a bankruptcy proceeding. Those four large carriers carry about 80% of the nation\u2019s air traffic. The mergers have resulted in a much more profitable US airline industry, but far fewer choices for US air travelers, which can result in higher fares. The Biden administration has taken a much more aggressive approach in fighting mergers and combinations, including in the airline industry. Ahead of this deal it filed a federal lawsuit that challenged the alliance in the the Northeast United States between American and JetBlue. That alliance was dropped as JetBlue tried to win approval of its purchase of Spirit. The now-blocked JetBlue deal for Spirit came after JetBlue outbid a proposed merger between Spirit and another discount airline, Frontier Airlines. Spirit management had initially supported the Frontier deal, raising the possibility that regulators would block a deal with JetBlue. But once Spirit shareholders rejected the less lucrative Frontier deal, Spirit management changed course and accepted the deal with JetBlue. There is one other merger now being sought in the US airline industry, a proposed\u00a0$1.9 billion deal\u00a0to combine Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines. Shares of Hawaiian Holdings fell 2% on Tuesday afternoon. Spirit has been a leader in the ultra-low cost portion of the airline market, with very low\u00a0rates\u00a0on top of which passengers pay for any extras, including carry-on bags. While that approach has prompted the nation\u2019s major carriers to offer a certain number of seats on their planes in a \u201cbasic\u00a0economy\u201d class with similar fare structure, it has also regularly made Spirit the airline with the lowest customer satisfaction ratings and the butt of jokes on late-night television.",

            "text": "Goldman Sachs reported a strong fourth quarter earnings report, driven largely by impressive results in their asset and wealth management divisions. The company announced Tuesday that profit had increased by about 51% from a year ago, to just over $2 billion. Revenue came in at $11.3 billion and earnings per share were $5.48, blowing away Wall Street expectations. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected revenue of $10.8 billion and earnings per share of just $3.62. But the majority of the Goldman\u2019s gains didn\u2019t come from investment banking and trading, which are typically the New York-based bank\u2019s strongest divisions. Revenue from investment banking fell 12% from a year ago to just under $1.7 billion. Trading revenue fell 2.5% to $4.6 billion over the same period. The investment bank instead said it was focused on simplifying its strategy this year and investing and growing in its asset and wealth management division, which is closely linked to stock market performance. That appeared to be a winning strategy, with revenue growing within that division by 23% from a year ago. \u201cThis was a year of execution for Goldman Sachs,\u201d said CEO and chairman David Solomon, in a release. \u201cWith everything we achieved in 2023 coupled with our clear and simplified strategy, we have a much stronger platform for 2024.\u201d Last year, the bank narrowed its ambitions in consumer markets and stopped offering new loans on Marcus, its consumer platform. The company is currently trying to end credit card partnerships with Apple and General Motors, as well. The dissolving of its consumer arm has been costly. Prior to this report, Goldman posted eight consecutive quarters of declines. Much like its banking peers, Goldman was also assessed a one-time fee by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to help pay for the regional banking crisis last spring. Goldman paid $529 million to help clean up the mess that Silicon Valley Bank\u00a0and Signature Bank\u00a0left in the wake of their collapses. That\u2019s a hefty fee, but scores less than the largest US banks paid. JPMorgan Chase paid $2.9 billion to the FDIC, Bank of America paid $2.1 billion and Citigroup paid $1.7 billion. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, reported a 32% drop in quarterly profit in its earnings report on Tuesday. Like its peers, the bank saw its earnings depressed by similar one-time fees. Shares of Goldman were up 1.5% in morning trading. Shares of Morgan Stanley dropped 3.8%. This story is developing and will be updated. ",

The FAA said Thursday it is opening an investigation into Boeing\u2019s quality control due to the failure of the door plug. The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting its own investigation, separate from the FAA. On Wednesday, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun admitted in an interview with CNBC that the door plug failure was a \u201chorrible escape\u201d of its manufacturing and quality control processes. When asked what happened, Calhoun told CNBC, \u201cWhat happened is exactly what you saw, a fuselage plug blew out. That\u2019s the mistake, it can never happen.\u201d Here are the latest updates on Boeing and the effects of Alaska Air flight 1282. Major cancellations throughout the US On Friday, the United States faced the highest number of cancellations in six months. That\u2019s thanks to a combination of winter weather and the continued grounding of Boeing 737 Max 9 planes. There were more than 2,000 cancellations as of Friday afternoon. Most of the cancellations are due to a winter storm that is pounding the Midwest. Chicago\u2019s two major airports are seeing the bulk of the cancellations, with nearly 40% of departing flights at O\u2019Hare and more than 60% of departing flights at Midway, according to FlightAware Friday afternoon. But the grounding of 737 Max 9 planes has exacerbated the issue. More than 200 United and Alaska Airlines flights have been canceled each day this week due to last Friday\u2019s FAA-mandated grounding. The FAA and Boeing are still trying to settle on an inspection protocol that would allow those planes to resume flying. FAA audits Boeing The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday its audit of the Boeing 737 Max 9 \u201cproduction line and its suppliers\u201d will focus on quality control. The audit will also assess \u201csafety risks around delegated authority and quality oversight,\u201d a practice that FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement \u201cis time to re-examine.\u201d Whitaker said the agency is also considering the use of a third party for the audit. Class action lawsuit A class action lawsuit was filed Thursday in Washington state against Boeing on behalf of the passengers aboard last week\u2019s Alaska Airlines flight 1282. According to the lawsuit\u2019s allegations, \u201cthe event physically injured some passengers and emotionally traumatized most if not all aboard. The violence of the event bruised the bodies of some\u201d and \u201cpassengers were shocked, terrorized and confused, thrust into a waking nightmare, hoping they would live long enough to walk the earth again.\u201d Some of the plaintiffs listed in the lawsuit cited various injuries they allegedly suffered as a result of the incident, including \u201cdifficulty breathing,\u201d \u201ccausing a concussion\u201d and a loss of hearing. In addition to injuries, other damages were claimed such as \u201ccharges for evaluation and/or treatment of health conditions and associated travel expenses, ticket fees, costs associated with cancelation of travel plans, the value of lost personal items, lost wages,\u201d etc. The lawsuit is requesting a trial to determine the damage amounts. Boeing did not have comment. Aviation experts question door plug design Some aviation experts raised questions about the structural design of\u00a0the\u00a0section of the\u00a0Boeing 737 Max 9\u00a0that blew off\u00a0the plane. In interviews with CNN, the experts argued that if the door plug were designed to be larger than the opening it covers and installed inside the plane, the force of the pressurized air in the passenger cabin would force the plug against the plane\u2019s interior frame and a situation such as the one on the Alaska Airlines flight could have been avoided. However, such a design could have added costs and practical disadvantages, some said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to me why they would do it that way and not have it installed from the inside, where it literally cannot come out unless there is a structural failure in the airframe,\u201d said David Soucie, a former FAA safety inspector and CNN analyst. \u201cHistorically, since we have had pressurized airplanes, emergency exits are designed to come inward\u2026 so why would they have not done the same thing with this plug?\u201d \u2014 CNN\u2019s\u00a0Joe Sutton,\u00a0Pete Muntean,\u00a0Curt Devine, and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.",

One hundred and seventy-one of the planes remain grounded in the United States as airlines Alaska and United await updated emergency inspection guidance from the FAA. The FAA said it plans to collect data from the inspection of 40 of the planes using Boeing\u2019s procedures before deciding whether the process will work for the rest of the grounded planes. It\u2019s unclear whether the 40 planes will come from the Alaska Airlines fleet or the United Airlines fleet \u2013 the two airlines that fly this model of aircraft \u2013 or both. \u201cWe are working to make sure nothing like this happens again,\u201d\u00a0FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement.

Boeing, in a statement, said it welcomed the additional scrutiny. \u201cWe welcome the FAA\u2019s announcement and will cooperate fully and transparently with our regulator,\u201d Boeing said. \u201cWe support all actions that strengthen quality and safety and\u00a0we\u00a0are taking actions across our production system.\u201d The lack of a timeline from the FAA raises the possibility that the planes may be grounded for some time until the regulator can be certain that they are safe to fly. Alaska Airlines said\u00a0in a statement Wednesday that\u00a0it canceled all flights on 737-9 Max aircraft through Saturday, January 13 \u2013 that\u2019s about 110-150 flights per day. It hasn\u2019t yet made any announcements about future flights. United has also been canceling hundreds of flights a day because of the grounding. Boeing\u00a0CEO David Calhoun on Tuesday acknowledged the company made a \u201cmistake\u201d related to the\u00a0Alaska Airlines incident\u00a0at a staff-wide safety meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re going to approach this number one acknowledging our mistake,\u201d Calhoun told staff Tuesday, according to a\u00a0video of the meeting provided to CNN by Boeing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to approach it with 100% and complete transparency every step of the way.\u201d On Wednesday, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun admitted in an interview with CNBC that the door plug failure was a \u201chorrible escape\u201d of its manufacturing and quality control processes. When asked what exactly happened, Calhoun told CNBC, \u201cWhat happened is exactly what you saw, a fuselage plug blew out. That\u2019s the mistake, it can never happen.\u201d In that interview, Calhoun emphasized that he is \u201cconfident\u201d in the FAA\u2019s ongoing work to \u201cinspect each and every one of the airplanes\u201d and make \u201ccertain that they\u2019re in conformance with our design, which is a proven design.\u201d Jennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the NTSB, told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d Wednesday that the FAA and Boeing \u201creally need that information about how that occurred before they can take actions to unground the planes.\u201d \u201cI would recommend that they not put those back in service until they absolutely know how this occurred,\u201d said Homendy. \u201cThat will tell them what inspections need to take place and what repairs need to take place.\u201d A Boeing source told CNN that Boeing believes \u201cthe mistake in question\u201d was introduced in the aircraft\u2019s manufacturing supply chain. A history of incidents For five years, Boeing has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and a halt in deliveries of others. The 737 Max\u2019s design was found to be responsible for two fatal crashes: one in Indonesia in October 2018, and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019. Together, the\u00a0two crashes killed all 346 people\u00a0aboard the two flights and led to a\u00a020-month grounding\u00a0of the company\u2019s best-selling jets, which\u00a0cost it more than $21 billion. Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as \u201cdesigned by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.\u201d Late last month, Boeing asked airlines to\u00a0inspect all of their 737 Max jets\u00a0for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft. Its quality and engineering problems have extended beyond the 737. Boeing also had to twice halt deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, for\u00a0about a year\u00a0starting in 2021\u00a0and again in 2023, due to quality concerns cited by the FAA.\u00a0And the\u00a0777 jet\u00a0also suffered a grounding after an engine failure on a United flight\u00a0scattered engine debris\u00a0onto homes and the ground below.

            "text": "Winter weather, combined with the grounding of Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft, is causing major disruptions for air travel. There have been more than more than 2000 flight cancellations Friday, the highest number since July 2023, data from the tracking site FlightAware show. Only a handful of days in all of 2023 had more cancellations than Friday\u2019s total. Last year, there were only three days when more than 2000 flights were cancelled, FlightAware data show, making today the fourth worst day for flight cancellations in the last 12 months. It is the most flights cancelled since June 2023. Most of the cancellations are due to a winter storm that is pounding the Midwest. Chicago\u2019s two major airports are seeing the bulk of the cancellations, with nearly 40% of departing flights at O\u2019Hare, and more than 60% of departing flights at Midway are cancelled, according to FlightAware. O\u2019Hare airport\u00a0posted\u00a0on social media that more than 650 flights have been \u201cproactively canceled\u201d by the airlines. Denver and Milwaukee flights are also being hard hit by the storm. Nearly 40% of Milwaukee\u2019s flights are also cancelled. Cancellations due to the grounding of the 737 Max 9 planes are also contributing to the totals. More than 200 United and Alaska Airlines flights have been cancelled each day this week due to the FAA-mandated grounding. The FAA and Boeing are still trying to settle on an inspection protocol that would allow those planes to resume flying. FlightAware shows Southwest, which doesn\u2019t fly the 737 Max 9, cancelling nearly 400 flights, the most of any airline. 737 Max 9 delays Passengers on Alaska Airlines and United Airlines have been marred by hundreds of flight cancellations this week. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded more than 150 Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft after a piece of the fuselage blew off an Alaska Airlines flight last Friday. It left a gaping hole in the side of the plane and ripped headrests off seats as the plane flew at 16,000 feet shortly after taking off from Portland, Oregon, carrying 177 people. Alaska on Friday confirmed to CNN that within 24 hours of the flight, it offered $1,500 cash and access to mental health resources for passengers of Flight 1282. The troubles are still ongoing for the airlines, which are the two largest US carriers that use the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft. On Friday, United canceled 10% of its operations and Alaska Airlines canceled 21%, according FlightAware data. United Airlines also announced on Friday that the airline extended its cancellation of Boeing 737 Max 9 flights through January 16. \u201cBy cancelling this far in advance, we\u2019re trying to create more certainty for our customers and more flexibility for our frontline teams to do their work,\u201d the airline said in a statement, \u201cThose things will be especially important as we also manage disruptive winter weather throughout much of the country.\u201d Alaska Airlines said in a statement Wednesday that it canceled all flights on 737-9 MAX aircraft through Saturday, January 13 \u2013 about 110-150 flights per day. Both Alaska and United Airlines say they found loose hardware or bolts in the assembly of door plugs \u2013 the part of the plane that flew off last week\u2019s Alaska flight \u2013 on their Boeing 737 Max 9s. The FAA has grounded affected Max 9s for inspection for days, and neither airline has has hinted that flights on those planes will resume soon. Max 9s Grounded On Saturday, the FAA ordered the grounding of 171 Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft that have \u201ca mid-cabin door plug installed.\u201d It\u2019s the model of the Boeing plane involved in the Alaska Airlines blowout incident. The FAA said the planes must be parked until emergency inspections are performed, which will \u201ctake around four to eight hours per aircraft.\u201d The planes remain grounded pending details on FAA-mandated inspections. The FAA is still reviewing guidance on the inspections from Boeing. As of Wednesday, Alaska\u2019s latest update said that the airline is still waiting for documentation from Boeing and the FAA to begin inspection of its 737-9 MAX fleet.\u00a0Alaska Airlines has also said it is working with Boeing to understand what happened on Flight 1282. \u201cWe regret the significant disruption that has been caused for our guests by cancellations due to these aircraft being out of service. However, the safety of our employees and guests is our highest priority and we will only return these aircraft to service when all findings have been fully resolved and meet all FAA and Alaska\u2019s stringent standards,\u201d the airline said in the Wednesday statement. Alaska said it has implemented a flexible travel policy, and that guests can change, cancel, or if the flight has been canceled, rebook. United Airlines said it had canceled 167 Boeing 737 Max 9 flights on Wednesday as it awaits \u201cfinal approval on the full inspection process\u2026 We expect significant cancellations on Thursday as well.\u201d On Thursday, the airline canceled an additional 175 Max 9 flights. By switching to other planes, it will avoid 35 additional cancellations. United uses more Max 9s than any other carrier. \u201cSince we began preliminary inspections on Saturday, we have found instances that appear to relate to installation issues in the door plug \u2013 for example, bolts that needed additional tightening. These findings will be remedied by our Tech Ops team to safely return the aircraft to service,\u201d the airline said Thursday. FAA investigation FAA on Thursday said it is opening an investigation into Boeing\u2019s quality control due to the failure of the door plug. In a statement, the FAA said the dramatic in-flight blowout on Alaska Airlines 1282 \u201cshould have never happened and it cannot happen again.\u201d The FAA says the investigation will focus on whether Boeing \u201cfailed to ensure completed products conformed to its approved design and were in a condition for safe operation in compliance with FAA regulations.\u201d Boeing said it \u201cwill cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA and the NTSB on their investigations\u201d in a statement Thursday. On Wednesday, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun admitted in an interview with CNBC that the door plug failure was a \u201chorrible escape\u201d of its manufacturing and quality control processes. When asked what exactly happened, Calhoun told CNBC, \u201cWhat happened is exactly what you saw, a fuselage plug blew out.

A class action lawsuit was filed on Thursday in Washington state against Boeing on behalf of the passengers aboard last week\u2019s Alaska Airlines flight 1282. \u201cBoeing is responsible for the safety of design and maintenance instructions as well as continuing airworthiness of the aircraft,\u201d the lawsuit said. More troubles for United It was a difficult 2023 for United. The carrier canceled thousands of flights last summer, stranding hundreds of thousands of passengers in a widespread service meltdown. Beyond the bad weather, the problems were also human-made. United CEO Scott Kirby largely blamed the FAA and inadequate staffing at airline control centers. But Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who oversees the FAA, pushed back, noting United was struggling relative to other US carriers. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Marnie Hunter,\u00a0Forrest Brown, Paradise Afshar,\u00a0Elizabeth Wolfe,\u00a0Gregory Wallace,\u00a0Pete Muntean, Sara Smart and Chris Isidore contributed to this report.

            "text": "With no reported fatal accidents involving\u00a0large commercial jets\u00a0in scheduled service, 2023 has been widely hailed as one of the safest years in the history of aviation. And the air transport system\u00a0is\u00a0safe. But the aviation system and its safety margins are\u00a0showing signs of stress. In the United States, there were nearly two dozen serious\u00a0runway incursions\u00a0in 2023, up from 16 the previous year. Thankfully, none of those events ended in a fatal accident. However, tragedy\u00a0did strike last week when\u00a0a\u00a0Japan Airlines\u00a0Airbus A350 collided with a much smaller Japan coast guard aircraft on a runway at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda Airport. All 379 passengers and crew on the airliner escaped due\u00a0largely\u00a0to the professionalism and training of the crew, but five of the six people on board the coast guard aircraft were killed. Just a few days later, an\u00a0Alaska Airlines\u00a0Boeing\u00a0737 Max 9 made\u00a0an emergency\u00a0landing in Portland, Oregon, after a\u00a0door plug\u00a0blew out of the fuselage shortly after takeoff, causing rapid depressurization of the passenger cabin. No\u00a0serious injuries were reported. These\u00a0recent\u00a0events serve as critical reminders of the dynamic and evolving nature of the aviation system, where constant vigilance and continuous improvement are essential to maintain the highest\u00a0levels of safety and public trust. Both regulators and the aviation industry must heed the recent warning signs and recommit to maintaining the highest standards and quality to build an even more resilient aviation system. Perhaps most urgent is staffing. As air traffic has rebounded from the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the aviation industry continues to face a significant\u00a0challenge: the departure of thousands of trained and experienced professionals, such as pilots, maintenance\u00a0technicians,\u00a0air traffic controllers\u00a0and other safety-critical personnel. This exodus, which largely stems from retirements, has led to a significant turnover in the aviation workforce, which is particularly concerning given that achieving the highest levels of safety requires qualified and trained personnel. Aviation stakeholders, including airlines and the\u00a0Federal Aviation Administration, must focus on recruiting and effectively training new personnel. That will\u00a0help to\u00a0relieve pressure on existing staff and (eventually) make up for the lost expertise. Also important is the adoption of systems that enhance pilot and air traffic controller situational awareness \u2014 especially on airport surfaces like runways and taxiways \u2014 and build\u00a0additional layers of safety in an environment that is increasingly complex. These systems include cockpit-based displays that provide pilots with\u00a0timely alerting to potential hazards. Similarly, for air traffic controllers, radar-based\u00a0technologies, such as those installed at some busy airports in the US, provide a significantly improved picture of aircraft movement on runways, taxiways and ramps, especially in low visibility conditions. Some of the advanced capabilities, particularly those designed for air traffic controllers, could be deployed more widely if funds\u00a0were allocated by Congress. For cockpit-based systems, the standards have been slow to mature. Lastly,\u00a0better\u00a0safety data analysis and information sharing across the aviation community can proactively identify potential risks that might lead to safety incidents. These are indicators that, while not causing direct harm, can signal potential risks or vulnerabilities that might lead to safety incidents if unaddressed. Examples include altitude deviations, patterns of pilot and controller fatigue and equipment and part wear and tear. This data enables airlines, regulators, manufacturers and other industry stakeholders to respond swiftly to new potential safety issues. This cooperative approach ultimately fosters a more effective safety culture within the aviation\u00a0industry. We stand at an inflection point in the evolution of aviation safety, poised to elevate it to unprecedented levels. The confluence of technological innovation, commitment to the highest levels of quality, deeper understanding of human factors and a collaborative safety culture marks\u00a0a unique opportunity to redefine what safety means in the skies, to push the boundaries of what we have achieved so far. By harnessing the collective expertise, commitment and vision of the entire aviation community, we can propel aviation safety into a new paradigm, where continuous improvement and adaptability are not just ideals, but practical realities. This moment is not just about maintaining our impressive safety record; it\u2019s about envisioning and creating a future where aviation safety is more resilient, more intuitive and more integrated than ever before. With leadership and working together, the aviation community can make an already safe system even safer.",

As airlines scrambled to renew fleets last year,\u00a0Airbus\u00a0said it had won 2,319 gross orders and 2,094 net orders after cancellations. Confirming a Reuters report, it said it delivered 735 airplanes, leaving its order backlog at 8,598. Airbus\u00a0CEO Guillaume Faury said the planemaker, which analysts say made a slow start to the year as it wrestled with tight supply chains, had seen \u201cincreased flexibility and capability\u201d in its industrial system. He added that he was confident\u00a0Airbus\u00a0would meet a delivery target of 75 A320 jets a month in 2026, with ten assembly lines active for the A320 family. \u201cThe situation in the supply chain is still tense. It\u2019s improving, it\u2019s getting better, but we are also flying higher as we continue to ramp up in 2024,\u201d Faury told a news conference. Boeing, which is still recovering from a safety grounding of its 737 MAX followed by a spate of production problems, said this week it had\u00a0delivered\u00a0528 aircraft in 2023 and booked 1,314 net new orders after allowing for cancellations. Christian Scherer, who in January stepped up from the top sales job to become CEO of commercial aircraft, the core plane making business at\u00a0Airbus, said aviation had recovered faster than expected from the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for wide-body jets was rebounding particularly sharply, he said, adding in a statement: \u201cTravel is back and there is serious momentum.\u201d He added that making up for the backlog quickly was a priority for the European planemaker. \u201cThe responsibility is to live up to this commitment to deliver a backlog of 8600 aircraft on time, on quality,\u201d he told a press conference. Boeing is under fresh scrutiny over production following a cabin blowout that prompted a partial new grounding of one type of 737 MAX.

The move comes after the two airlines that operate the Max 9 in the United States\u2013Alaska Airlines and United Airlines\u2014found either loose hardware or bolts in the assembly of door plugs on their aircraft. United Airlines says its discovery pointed to possible installation issues.\u00a0The planes remain grounded pending details on FAA-mandated inspections. The FAA is still reviewing guidance on the inspections from Boeing. On Wednesday, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun admitted in an interview with CNBC that the door plug failure was a \u201chorrible escape\u201d of its manufacturing and quality control processes. When asked what exactly happened, Calhoun told CNBC, \u201cWhat happened is exactly what you saw, a fuselage plug blew out. That\u2019s the mistake, it can never happen.\u201d In that interview, Calhoun emphasized that he is \u201cconfident\u201d in the FAA\u2019s ongoing work to \u201cinspect each and every one of the airplanes\u201d and make \u201ccertain that they\u2019re in conformance with our design, which is a proven design.\u201d In a letter to Boeing, the FAA asked the plane maker to supply any information on the root cause and actions taken to prevent it from happening again. The FAA said Boeing now has 10 days to provide \u201cany evidence or statements\u201d to the agency. The FAA\u2019s investigation is separate from an investigation begun by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), specifically into the incident itself. NTSB spokesperson Eric Weiss said earlier this week that a preliminary report is expected in three to four weeks. But in the meantime, the agency has recovered key items sucked out of the plane. On Sunday, a Portland schoolteacher\u00a0found a piece of the aircraft\u2019s fuselage\u00a0that had landed\u00a0in his backyard and reached out to the agency. Two cell phones that were likely flung from the hole in the plane were also found in a yard and on the side of the road and turned over to investigators. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told CNN\u2019s \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u201d Tuesday that the recovered fuselage plug has \u201cquite a lot\u201d it can tell investigators and \u201creally was the missing piece in the investigation.\u201d The plane\u2019s plug door will be sent to the NTSB\u2019s lab for testing, Homendy said.

            "text": "In the aftermath of last week\u2019s Alaska Airlines in-flight emergency, some aviation experts\u00a0are\u00a0questioning the structural design of\u00a0the\u00a0section of the\u00a0Boeing 737 Max 9\u00a0that blew off\u00a0the plane. On that January 5 flight, a \u201cdoor plug\u201d \u2013 a portion of the plane\u2019s fuselage the manufacturer can put in place instead of an emergency exit door \u2013 detached from the plane and was later discovered in an Oregon backyard. In interviews with CNN, some experts argued that if that door plug were designed to be larger than the opening it covers and installed inside the plane,\u00a0the force of the pressurized air in the passenger cabin\u00a0would force the plug against the plane\u2019s interior frame and a\u00a0situation\u00a0such as the one on the Alaska Airlines flight could have been\u00a0avoided. However, such a design could have added costs and practical disadvantages, some said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to me why they would do it that way and not have it installed from the inside, where it literally cannot come out unless there is a structural failure in the airframe,\u201d\u00a0said David Soucie, a former FAA safety inspector and CNN analyst.\u00a0\u201cHistorically, since we have had pressurized airplanes, emergency exits are designed to come inward\u2026 so why would they have not done the same thing with this plug?\u201d Soucie said\u00a0the design of the door plug on the Max 9\u00a0may provide some advantages, such as making the plane more readily accessible for maintenance. Robert Ditchey, an aviation consultant, agreed that if\u00a0the plug\u00a0were\u00a0designed to be larger than the hole in the fuselage and installed inside the cabin, this incident\u00a0likely\u00a0would not have happened. \u201cIt should have been installed from the inside to the outside, not the other way around,\u201d Ditchey said of the plug, adding that the exterior installation raises the prospect that the bolts used to secure the plug could have failed. \u201cYou could have missing bolts,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThey could have had the wrong bolts, or they could have over-torqued the bolts thereby breaking them, or not torqued them enough.\u201d John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, said that while a different design could theoretically prevent a problem like this from happening, he described this design as adequate so long as proper installation and quality controls are followed. \u201cCould you design a plug door for this airplane that would prevent it from going out, the answer is yes you could. It just is going to cost you money and time,\u201d he said. \u201cWas this design adequate is the real question, and if it was installed properly, we wouldn\u2019t be talking about it.\u201d \u201cThere really is not a big issue with having this door in there, if it was secured right,\u201d Goglia said. A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment on the door-plug design, citing an active investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.\u00a0In a staff-wide meeting Tuesday, Boeing\u2019s CEO attributed the incident to a \u201cmistake,\u201d which he did not identify.\u00a0A company source\u00a0told\u00a0CNN that Boeing believes \u201cthe mistake in question\u201d was introduced in the aircraft\u2019s manufacturing supply chain. Boeing CEO David Calhoun told CNBC in an interview that aired Wednesday that\u00a0he is \u201cconfident\u201d in the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s ongoing work with airlines to \u201cinspect each and every one of the airplanes\u201d and make \u201ccertain that they\u2019re in conformance with our design, which is a proven design.\u201d Federal investigators have determined the components that may have been involved in the door plug coming loose, but they have not yet determined why it blew out, CNN\u00a0reported\u00a0Monday.\u00a0The door plug is typically held in place by stop fittings and has a set of bolts that prevent the door from moving and potentially flying off the plane.\u00a0Somehow, the plug on the Alaska Airlines flight moved, NTSB\u2019s Clint Crookshanks explained at a news conference Monday night. The FAA on Saturday ordered most Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft to be temporarily\u00a0grounded\u00a0as the cause of the incident is investigated. The order applies to about 171 planes. Former Transportation Inspector General Mary Schiavo, a CNN analyst, said door plugs have long been used in aviation and, in addition to the Max 9, have been used on\u00a0planes converted to freighters. But she also questioned this particular design. She said this door plug used on some Max 9s is \u201cdesigned not to be one of these wedge-doors, that when pressurized it can\u2019t be opened \u2026 it\u2019s a door that has to be opened from the outside during some inspections.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the part of the design that to me seems flawed,\u201d Schiavo said. Schiavo said she thinks Friday\u2019s incident will lead to additional door-plug inspection protocols for airlines. Separately,\u00a0a federal lawsuit filed last year by investors in Spirit AeroSystems \u2013 the supplier that makes the fuselage of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max jets \u2013 accused the company of \u201cwidespread and sustained quality failures\u201d in its products. The suit states that quality failures, which have allegedly ranged from debris in products to missing fasteners and peeling paint, led Boeing to place Spirit on probation from around 2018 to at least 2021.\u00a0The suit, which was previously reported by the publication The Lever, does not specifically mention door plugs. The suit claims that \u201cconstant quality failures resulted in part from Spirit\u2019s culture which prioritized production numbers and short-term financial outcomes over product quality, and Spirit\u2019s related failure to hire sufficient personnel to deliver quality products at the rates demanded by Spirit and its customers including Boeing.\u201d The suit further states that a former Spirit AeroSystems employee who worked as a quality manager and inspector\u00a0and who was not named in the suit wrote an ethics complaint to the company in 2022 that described an \u201cexcessive amount of defects\u201d in products. The former employee believes \u201cSpirit treats moving products down the line as more important than quality,\u201d according to the suit. A spokesperson for Spirit AeroSystems,\u00a0Joe Buccino,\u00a0said in a statement that\u00a0\u201cSpirit strongly disagrees with the assertions made by plaintiffs in the amended complaint and intends to vigorously defend against the claims. Spirit will not comment further as to the pending litigation.\u201d A Boeing spokesperson declined comment on that suit. In April, Spirit AeroSystems\u00a0identified\u00a0a production issue on the aft fuselage section of certain\u00a0737\u00a0models. \u201cThis is not an immediate safety of flight issue. We have processes in place to address these of types of production issues upon identification, which we are following,\u201d the company then said in a statement. In August, the company\u00a0disclosed\u00a0improper holes drilled on the \u201caft pressure bulkhead\u201d on some models of the\u00a0737\u00a0fuselage. Both Spirit and Boeing said in\u00a0statements\u00a0that the issue was determined not to be an immediate flight-safety concern. In December, Boeing\u00a0asked\u00a0airlines to inspect their 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after a potential problem was discovered. Boeing said a plane with a missing bolt was fixed but wanted all Max planes in service checked. Boeing\u00a0has\u00a0faced\u00a0scrutiny since two fatal crashes involving 737 Max 8\u2019s\u2013 one in Indonesia in October 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019 \u2013 that killed 346 people.\u00a0A safety system called MCAS used in those planes was\u00a0linked\u00a0to both crashes.",

            "text": "Walmart is joining the AI, drone and tech race. But delivering on the promise of a high-tech shopping future \u2014\u00a0where its rivals have failed \u2014 won\u2019t be easy. The bigbox retailer held a keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas for the first time, featuring CEO Doug McMillon, a plethora of executives, and even Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Its overarching pitch through the hour-long presentation was this: Consumers are going to have a much faster, more convenient time shopping at Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club. CES is the largest consumer tech conference of the year \u2014 but it\u2019s also a major sales convention, where companies put on flashy presentations to attract both investors and customers, often before actively implementing the new technology. In that vein, this year\u2019s conference was, naturally, all about AI. \u201cThe underlying principle is that we should use technology to serve people and not the other way around. This path enables people to do things in more efficient and enjoyable ways,\u201d McMillon said. Walmart is jumping on the AI trend for now. The company said it\u2019s implementing it in everything from its supply chain to its app, along with developments to drone delivery and shopping at Sam\u2019s Club. It\u2019s important to note that Walmart has not rolled out its plans nationwide yet. Many of its announcements are currently in select markets, though the company said it plans to roll them out this year. Drone delivery Walmart has already made 20,000 drone deliveries in the past two years, but in 2024 it is going all in on the Dallas-Fort Worth Area. The superstore announced that it is offering drone delivery for up to 75%\u00a0of the Dallas area\u2019s population, or about 1.8 million homes. But drone delivery as a concept isn\u2019t new, and Walmart\u2019s timeline to take off in Dallas is remarkably short. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos revealed delivery drones on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d nearly a decade ago, but the technology has long faced regulatory, technical and financial problems for tech companies. While companies from UPS to Volkswagen initially started out bullish on using drones for their business supply chains, hurdles have remained and stymied tech delivery for both smaller startups and huge retailers like Amazon or pharmacy chains. The money at stake is substantial: A Fortune Business Insights\u00a0report has estimated that the commercial drone market will balloon to nearly $47.4 billion by 2029. First, however, companies must navigate regulations, consumer skepticism and the actual safe return of their technology. The Federal Aviation Administration regulates commercial drone deliveries, and they have high standards to meet. For example, CNBC reported last year that FAA required Amazon\u2019s Prime Air to complete hundreds of hours of flying without incidents and submit data to the agency before a broader rollout, and that was after it allowed clearance for testing.  Walmart has similarly ambitious plans. Its delivery expansion includes 30 towns and municipalities, which the retailer says will lead the retail industry. Drone deliveries take between 10 to 30 minutes, the company said. Around 75% of the 120,000 items in the superstore meet the size and weight requirements for a drone delivery, Prathibha Rajashekhar, senior vice president of innovation and automation for Walmart US, said during the presentation. Amazon\u2019s Prime Air said it wants to expand drone delivery to Italy and the UK by the end of 2024, as well as a third US state. Walmart is partnering with drone startups\u00a0Wing\u00a0and\u00a0Zipline, according to a press release. Exit tech that\u2019s new for customers One of the most universal experiences of Sam\u2019s Club shopping \u2014 showing your receipt before leaving the store \u2014 will soon be no more. Using AI and computer vision technology, the new exit tech builds on its established \u201cScan & Go\u201d feature on Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s app. In Scan & Go, customers scan their items on the mobile app as they go through the store and pay on the app, bypassing the checkout line. Walmart didn\u2019t specify how AI would be used, but said it would be \u201cworking in the background to continually speed the process.\u201d Amazon launched a similar concept in 2016 with its Go stores in 2016, its checkout free system hailed as the future of shopping. But by March 2023, it had closed eight of its 29 cashier-free stores, another sign of the tech giant\u2019s cost-cutting efforts last year. Technology at the exit takes images of carts and verifies payment for all the products in real time. It\u2019s currently running as a pilot in 10 Sam\u2019s Club locations, but the company plans to expand the technology to all of its locations by the end of the year. Generative AI Through a partnership with Microsoft, Walmart said it is revamping its generative AI usage. Generative artificial intelligence\u00a0\u2014 the technology that underpins ChatGPT and similar tools \u2014\u00a0is the latest buzzword in tech, but its practical applications remain untested. The company didn\u2019t announce any new ventures, but said it was using AI to build on its existing app and InHome service. Walmart launched the GenAi search experience for Apple customers on Tuesday, who have the latest version of the app. Normally, customers who need to shop for a Super Bowl party search for items on the Walmart app individually, the company said. With GenAi search, they can instead search \u201cfootball watch party\u201d and shop every relevant item they need in the search. Walmart also announced advancements in its InHome service, which it debuted in 2019 to deliver groceries straight into customer\u2019s refrigerators. Walmart employees wear a camera when they enter customer homes, allowing the customer to watch the process live. The customers have to use an existing smart lock, a garage keypad or a smart lock from InHome. The program has had some hiccups. Walmart already uses a network of independent contract drivers on its in-house Spark delivery platforms, which Walmart said in June 2023 operates in all 50 states. Business Insider interviewed Spark drivers, who said customers would get confused their deliver for InHome delivery, asking drivers to bring the products inside the house.  The new replenishment tool for InHome uses AI to anticipate needs and orders. The company said its \u201calgorithm learns what customers purchase regularly, how much of these items they purchase and the frequency of those purchases.\u201d Amazon Key has a rival in-garage delivery, which is exclusive for Prime members, compatible with certain smart garages. The service costs $1.99 per order for a one to two day delivery time. Walmart\u2019s InHome currently costs $19.95 a month or $138 a year.  ",

            "text": "On Friday, an Alaska Airlines flight carrying 177 people made an emergency landing shortly following takeoff\u00a0from Portland, Oregon, after part of the wall of a new 737 Max 9 aircraft detached mid-flight and left a gaping hole in\u00a0the side of the plane. Remarkably, no one was killed or seriously injured in the incident, though clips of the harrowing accident quickly went viral. Here is the latest on what to know as Boeing faces yet another 737 Max crisis. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun acknowledges \u2018quality escape,\u2019 but defends company\u2019s \u2018proven design\u2019 During a new interview with CNBC on Wednesday afternoon, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d and \u201cemotional\u201d after seeing video from the Alaska Airlines midflight blowout last Friday. When asked what exactly happened, Calhoun told CNBC, \u201cWhat happened is exactly what you saw, a fuselage plug blew out. That\u2019s the mistake, it can never happen.\u201d But Calhoun emphasized that he is \u201cconfident\u201d in the FAA\u2019s ongoing work to \u201cinspect each and every one of the airplanes\u201d and make \u201ccertain that they\u2019re in conformance with our design, which is a proven design.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m confident that that process will not only prevent an accident, but maybe more importantly, the data we collect from each and every one of those inspections, the data we collect will inform all of the actions that we have to take as a company,\u201d Calhoun said. Still, Calhoun acknowledged that a \u201cquality escape occurred\u201d at some point that allowed the plane to fly in the first place, and said he looks forward to sharing more details about this after the investigation concludes. Meanwhile, as scrutiny is increasingly placed on aviation supplier Spirit Aerosystems, Calhoun told CNBC that he is confident in their CEO Patrick Shanahan. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to point fingers there. Because yes, it escaped their factory, but then it escaped ours too,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re all in this together. We have to figure this one out.\u201d \u201cThis one is a horrible escape,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure that we take steps to ensure that it never, never can happen.\u201d The 737 Max 9 remains grounded On Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered most Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft to be temporarily grounded as regulators and Boeing investigate the cause of the incident. The order applies to some 171 planes. That has led to hundreds of cancelations, particularly from Alaska Airlines and United Airlines, which have dozens of the 737 Max 9 planes. Alaska Airlines acknowledged Wednesday the Boeing 737 Max 9 will not fly for at least several more days, extending its cancelations for flights scheduled on that plane through Saturday. United Airlines said it is canceling 167 Boeing 737 Max 9 flights today and expects significant cancellations on Thursday, too. \u201cWe regret the significant disruption that has been caused for our guests by cancellations due to these aircraft being out of service,\u201d Alaska Airlines said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cWe are working around the clock to reaccommodate impacted guests on other flights.\u201d The top safety inspector probing the Boeing 737 Max 9 blowout warned regulators Wednesday about hastily allowing the plane model to fly again. Jennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d Wednesday that the FAA and Boeing \u201creally need that information about how that occurred before they can take actions to unground the planes.\u201d \u201cI would recommend that they not put those back in service until they absolutely know how this occurred,\u201d said Homendy. \u201cThat will tell them what inspections need to take place and what repairs need to take place.\u201d Meanwhile, Spirit AeroSystems \u2014 the Boeing contractor that builds the 737 Max 9 fuselage \u2014 says it is now part of the NTSB investigation. Outside of the airline industry, the accident has caught the attention of lawmakers.\u00a0In a statement on Tuesday, Republican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio called for the Senate Commerce Committee to convene a hearing to \u201cevaluate incidents involving the 737 Max,\u00a0Boeing\u2019s engineering and safety standards, and\u00a0the\u00a0quality of oversight provided by the FAA and other relevant government agencies.\u201d President Joe Biden is monitoring the issue, the White House said Tuesday. Boeing has faced years of problems For five years, Boeing has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and the halt in deliveries of others. The 737 Max\u2019s design was found to be responsible for two fatal crashes: one in Indonesia in October 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019. Together, the\u00a0two crashes killed all 346 people\u00a0aboard the two flights and led to a\u00a020-month grounding\u00a0of the company\u2019s best-selling jets, which\u00a0cost it more than $21 billion. Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as \u201cdesigned by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.\u201d Late last month, Boeing asked airlines to inspect all of their 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft. Its quality and engineering problems have extended beyond the 737. Boeing also had to twice halt deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, for\u00a0about a year\u00a0starting in 2021\u00a0and again in 2023, due to quality concerns cited by the FAA.\u00a0And the\u00a0777 jet\u00a0also suffered a grounding after an engine failure on a United flight\u00a0scattered engine debris\u00a0onto homes and the ground below. Boeing\u2019s CEO has acknowledged its mistake CEO David Calhoun acknowledged the company\u2019s \u201cmistake\u201d related to the Alaska Airlines incident at a staff-wide \u201csafety meeting\u201d Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to approach this number one acknowledging our mistake,\u201d Calhoun told staff, according to a partial readout of the meeting shared with CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re going to approach it with 100% and complete transparency every step of the way. We are going to work with the NTSB [National Transportation Safety Board] who is investigating the accident itself to find out what the cause is.\u201d A company source previously told CNN that Boeing believes \u201cthe mistake in question\u201d was introduced in the aircraft\u2019s manufacturing supply chain, however it is not immediately clear if Calhoun identified any specific error during the presentation. Now investigators want to know more. \u201cI have a lot of questions on that statement,\u201d Homendy told CNN Wednesday.\u00a0\u201cHe stated that mistakes were made, and I\u2019d like to understand what mistakes he is referring to.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0She said she has not yet spoken to Calhoun. Calhoun appeared to address some of the images that emerged from the accident during his remarks to employees Tuesday, including some that showed a gaping hole in the side of the plane. \u201cWhen I got that picture, all I could think about \u2013 I didn\u2019t know what happened so whoever was supposed to be in the seat next to that hole in the airplane,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cI\u2019ve got kids, I\u2019ve got grandkids and so do you. This stuff matters. Every detail matters.\u201d Of the ongoing investigation, Calhoun added that he \u201ctrust[s] every step they take, and they will get to a conclusion.\u201d Boeing still had a great 2023 Despite its problems, Boeing capped its best year since the 737 Max grounding\u00a0in 2019, reporting record new plane orders in December and one of its best years for sales ever. The American plane maker reported 1,456 gross orders for the year, which was one of its best years ever. Adjusted for canceled orders, the annual total came to 1,314 commercial aircraft, its third best year on record by that measure and its best total since 2014. Much of its success is due to the fact that Boeing and Airbus\u00a0are the only two\u00a0major global aviation companies. That means Boeing probably doesn\u2019t have to worry about being forced out of business, no matter how extensive its mistakes. Neither company could accommodate all commercial aircraft demand, and both have a backlog of orders stretching back years. But the problems have meant that Boeing continues to fall further behind Airbus. What\u2019s been found so far A preliminary report is expected in three to four weeks, NTSB spokesperson Eric Weiss said. On Monday night, NTSB said it\u2019s continuing to recover items sucked out from the plane. On Sunday, a Portland schoolteacher\u00a0found a piece of the aircraft\u2019s fuselage\u00a0that had landed\u00a0in his backyard and reached out to the agency. Two cell phones that were likely flung from the hole in the plane were also found in a yard and on the side of the road and turned over to investigators. Early details are still shocking. The damage extended to several rows on the plane. The two seats next to the detached door plug just happened to be empty when the blowout happened, but had their headrests torn off, according to NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy. On Monday, United Airlines \u2014 which has more Max 9s than any other US carrier \u2014 said it found loose door plug bolts on an undisclosed number of its Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft as it was performing the FAA-mandated inspections of the jets. Alaska Airlines also said Monday it found loose hardware on some of its 737 Max 9 planes during inspections. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Catherine Thorbecke, Chris Isidore, Greg Wallace and Pete Muntean contributed to this report.

            "text": "Billionaire hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman and several other business leaders are demanding Harvard University release the names of students whose organizations signed on to a letter blaming solely Israel for the deadly attacks by Hamas.  The CEOs want the students blacklisted. But some of those students have since distanced themselves from the letter. \u201cOne should not be able to hide behind a corporate shield when issuing statements supporting the actions of terrorists,\u201d Ackman said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. If the members support the letter, the names of the signatories \u201cshould be made public so their views are publicly known,\u201d Ackman said. The CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management said he wanted to ensure his company and others don\u2019t \u201cinadvertently hire\u201d any students belonging to Harvard groups that signed the letter. Following a backlash to the statement, some of the student groups have since withdrawn their endorsements. Multiple other business leaders, including the CEOs of shopping club FabFitFun, health tech startup EasyHealth and Dovehill Capital Management supported the call from Ackman to name the students. \u201cI would like to know so I know never to hire these people,\u201d Jonathan Neman, CEO of restaurant chain Sweetgreen, said on X. Neither Neman nor Ackman responded to requests for comment. Others warn that naming the students whose groups backed the statement could put the students in harms way and did not account for differences of opinion within the student groups. Larry Summers, the famed economist who on Monday drew attention to the \u201cmorally unconscionable\u201d Harvard student statement, is now preaching caution.  \u201cI yield to no one in my revulsion at the statement apparently made on behalf of 30 plus @Harvard student group,\u201d Summers said in a Wednesday afternoon post on X. \u201cBut please everybody take a deep breath. Many in these groups never saw the statement before it went out. In some cases those approving did not understand exactly what they were approving.\u201d Summers, the former president of Harvard and US Treasury Secretary, added that \u201cprobably some were naive and foolish.\u201d \u201cThis is not a time where it is constructive to vilify individuals and I am sorry that is happening,\u201d Summers said.  Harvard professor and legal scholar Laurence Tribe told CNN Wednesday he initially agreed with Ackman but on reflection decided not to join the push to publicize their names. \u201cAny number of the students who got caught up in this misguided campaign probably didn\u2019t even know there was a statement. Others no doubt didn\u2019t focus on, much less understand, what they were signing,\u201d Tribe said in an email. \u201cNaive and stupid as they may have been, I now think it would be an overreaction to penalize them permanently by publishing their names and implying that they actually endorsed what the terrorists did to innocent Israelis.\u201d Similarly, Meds.com CEO Stephen Sullivan wrote that people should be \u201cangry at the administration and teachers\u201d but cautioned against putting college students\u2019 names on a list, according to Forbes. Harvard University did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Harvard President Claudine Gay issued a statement Tuesday saying \u201cno student group \u2013 not even 30 student groups \u2013 speaks for Harvard University or its leadership.\u201d Harvard student groups\u2019 statement The controversy comes in response to a joint statement released by a coalition of Harvard student groups following the attacks by Hamas that have killed more than 1,000 Israelis and at least 14 American citizens. \u201cWe, the undersigned student organizations, hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence,\u201d the statement from the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Groups said. The statement said millions of Palestinians in Gaza have been \u201cforced to live in an open-air prison\u201d and called on Harvard to \u201ctake action to stop the ongoing annihilation of Palestinians.\u201d A footnote at the bottom of the statement said the names of the \u201coriginal signing organizations have been concealed at this time.\u201d Jake Wurzak, the CEO of Dovehill Capital Management, said he believed the students who signed the letter should be named. \u201cFree Speech is paramount. Words have meaning and students shouldn\u2019t be allowed to hide behind an institution,\u201d Wurzak said on X. Some students withdraw their signatures According to the Harvard Crimson student newspaper, at least five of the original 34 signatories have withdrawn their endorsements as of Tuesday night. For example, the Harvard Undergraduate Nepali Student Association said on Instagram \u201cwe regret\u201d that the decision to co-sign the statement has been \u201cinterpreted as a tacit support for the recent violent attacks in Israel.\u201d \u201cTo ensure that our stance on the condemnation of violence by Hamas and support for a just peace remains clear, we retract our signatures from the statement,\u201d the Nepali student group said. Act on a Dream, a student group supporting immigrants, told the Crimson the group signed the statement as a \u201cresult of miscommunication and a lack of due diligence in sharing the statement with the entirety of the board.\u201d Others responded to Ackman saying students weren\u2019t aware of the letter\u2019s content or that groups they belong to were signing the statement. Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, told CNN on Wednesday he doesn\u2019t know about the wisdom of releasing the names of the students but called for them to take responsibility on their own. \u201cIt is an outrageously offensive piece and anyone who signed it should either stand behind it and face the consequences in life or step up and apologize and explain themselves,\u201d Greenblatt said. \u201cThis is what we learn to do in elementary school. It\u2019s hard for me to understand why it\u2019s complicated for people at Harvard University.\u201d Real-life consequences for anti-Israel statement Separately, there has been a backlash against a statement released by the president of the NYU Student Bar Association saying Israel \u201cbears full responsibility for this tremendous loss of life.\u201d That statement had immediate consequences, with law firm Winston & Strawn promptly pulling a job offer to the NYU student who previously served as a summer associate at the firm. \u201cThese comments are profoundly in conflict with Winston & Strawn\u2019s values as a firm. Accordingly, the Firm has rescinded the law student\u2019s offer of employment,\u201d the law firm said in a post on X. \u201cWinston stands in solidarity with Israel\u2019s right to exist in peace and condemns Hamas and the violence and destruction it has ignited in the strongest terms possible.\u201d \u2018Morally unconscionable\u2019 After criticism from Summers and others, Harvard President Claudine Gay said there should be \u201cno doubt that I condemn the terrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas.\u201d \u201cSuch inhumanity is abhorrent, whatever one\u2019s individual views of the origins of longstanding conflicts in the region,\u201d Gay said. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told CNN on Wednesday that Jews have many centuries of \u201cbeing blamed as victims.\u201d  \u201cVillains cannot be celebrated as heroes,\u201d Sonnenfeld said in an email. \u201cAnyone who does so cannot hide as cowards behind the shields of association titles any more than Nazi stormtroopers were allowed anonymity.  Our society is founded on personal accountability.\u201d The Anti-Defamation League, in response to a \u201csurge of antisemitism around the world\u201d following the attacks on Israel, called on CEOs on Wednesday to speak out against hate and sign a pledge to fight antisemitism. The ADL said signatories include Accenture, Adidas and the NBA. \u201cFor companies that have Jewish employees, Jewish customers, Jewish investors, Jewish shareholders, or simply have a modicum of a conscience, this one should be easy,\u201d Greenblatt, the ADL CEO, told CNN.  This story has been updated to remove identifying information about two of the students over safety concerns. CNN\u2019s Kristina Sgueglia and Sabrina Shulman contributed to this report.",

            "text": "Boeing CEO David Calhoun acknowledged the company\u2019s \u201cmistake\u201d in the wake of the Alaska Airlines incident at a staff-wide \u201csafety meeting\u201d Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to approach this number one acknowledging our mistake,\u201d Calhoun told staff, according to a video of the meeting provided to CNN by Boeing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to approach it with 100% and complete transparency every step of the way. We are going to work with the NTSB who is investigating the accident itself to find out what the cause is.\u201d A company source told CNN that Boeing believes \u201cthe mistake in question\u201d was introduced in the aircraft\u2019s manufacturing supply chain, however it is not immediately clear if Calhoun identified any specific error during the presentation. On Friday, an Alaska Airlines flight carrying 177 people made an emergency landing shortly following takeoff from Portland, Oregon, after part of the wall of a weeks-old 737 Max 9 aircraft detached and left a gaping hole in the side of the plane. On Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered most Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft to be temporarily grounded as regulators and Boeing investigate the cause of the incident. The order applies to some 171 planes around the world. Remarkably, no one was killed or seriously injured in Friday\u2019s midflight accident, which was partially caught on horrifying video clips by fellow passengers. Calhoun in the meeting praised the crew of the Alaska Airlines flight for their handling of the situation,\ufeff the meeting video showed. \u201cThey train their lives to do that. But you don\u2019t know until you know \u2013 I hope most never know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this crew, they stood the test and they delivered the airplane back home to us.\u201d The meeting also included a reminder of the seriousness of the situation. Employees were told that the company\u2019s Chief Safety Officer is now in charge of the 737 Max fleet. Mike Delaney is Boeing\u2019s Chief Aerospace Safety Officer. The meeting, which took place at noon Pacific from the 737 Max factory in Renton, Washington, also included an expression of confidence in \u201cBoeing, the airplane, and (Boeing\u2019s) employees,\u201d the source said. The company pledged to work with the FAA to ensure there are proper inspections. On Tuesday, the FAA said that Boeing\u2019s plan for the inspection of door plugs on 737 Max 9 aircraft required revisions, and the aircraft will remain grounded in the meantime. \u201cBoeing offered an initial version of instructions yesterday which they are now revising because of feedback received in response,\u201d the FAA said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cUpon receiving the revised version of instructions from Boeing the FAA will conduct a thorough review.\u201d During the meeting, Boeing also pledged to work with the NTSB as it tries to determine what took place. Calhoun also acknowledged \u201cwe have a communications task with all of our customers.\u201d \u201cWe need to know we\u2019re starting from a very anxious moment with our customers and we simply have to have to deal with that reality,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cSo it\u2019s gonna be a lot about transparency.\u201d Calhoun appeared to address some of the images that emerged from the accident during his remarks to employees Tuesday, including some that showed a gaping hole in the side of the plane. \u201cWhen I got that picture, all I could think about \u2013 I didn\u2019t know what happened so whoever was supposed to be in the seat next to that hole in the airplane,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cI\u2019ve got kids, I\u2019ve got grandkids and so do you. This stuff matters. Every detail matters.\u201d Of the ongoing investigation, Calhoun added that he \u201ctrust[s] every step they take, and they will get to a conclusion.\u201d The accident, meanwhile, is also garnering the attention of lawmakers. In a statement on Tuesday, Sen. J.D. Vance called for the Senate Commerce Committee to convene a hearing to \u201cevaluate incidents involving the 737 MAX,\u00a0Boeing\u2019s engineering and safety standards, and\u00a0the\u00a0quality of oversight provided by the FAA and other relevant government agencies.\u201d \u201cI hope such a hearing will occur as soon as possible,\u201d Vance, a Republican from Ohio, added. President Joe Biden is personally tracking the grounding of many Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes for inspection following the dramatic emergency landing of the Alaska Airlines flight last week, the White House said\u00a0Tuesday, as investigations continue. The White House is \u201crelieved\u201d that all passengers and crew of Alaska Airlines flight 1282 are safe, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, noting that the aircraft will remain grounded until FAA operators \u201ccomplete enhanced inspections.\u201d The latest on the investigation Exactly what led to a hole the size of a refrigerator to suddenly blow open on the passenger aircraft on Friday is still being investigated. A preliminary report is expected in three to four weeks, National Transportation Safety Board spokesperson Eric Weiss said. The NTSB said Monday night that it continues to recover objects that blew out of the plane. On Sunday, a Portland schoolteacher found a piece of the aircraft\u2019s fuselage that had landed in his backyard and reached out to the agency. Two cell phones that were likely flung from the hole in the plane were also found in a yard and on the side of the road and turned over to investigators. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy also told reporters over the weekend that Alaska Airlines had previously restricted the aircraft in Friday\u2019s incident from flying over the ocean after the plane\u2019s automatic pressurization warning light came on three times in the past month. Homendy, however, emphasized during a press conference late Monday night that the NTSB has \u201cno indications whatsoever that this correlated in any way\u201d to the incident that led to a piece of the plane from blowing off. Homendy has said that partly complicating the investigation is the loss of critical cockpit audio recordings, because of a device setting that overrides recordings after collecting two hours of audio. She advocated for the FAA and Congress to require 24-hour recordings of cockpit audio to be retained in all aircraft. Still, as investigators continue to comb through data, eyewitness accounts and examine the jet itself, the early details from the investigation are harrowing. The damage extended to several rows on the plane. The two seats next to the detached door plug just happened to be empty when the blowout happened, but had their headrests torn off, according to Homendy. Video from the incident \u201clooks very calm, but I\u2019m sure it was completely chaotic,\u201d Homendy said. Also on Monday, United Airlines \u2013 which has more Max 9s than any other US carrier \u2013 said it found loose door plug bolts on an undisclosed number of its Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft as it was performing the FAA-mandated inspections of the jets. Alaska Airlines also said Monday it found loose hardware on some of its 737 Max 9 planes during inspections. Boeing\u2019s fall from grace Friday\u2019s high-profile incident is putting a renewed spotlight on Boeing\u2019s fall from grace in recent years. The company has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft over the past five years, leading to the long-term grounding of some of its jets and the halt in deliveries of others. The most glaring quality problems for Boeing came with the 737 Max\u2019s design, which was judged to be responsible for two fatal crashes: one in Indonesia in October 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019. Together, the\u00a0two crashes killed all 346 people\u00a0aboard the two flights and led to a\u00a020-month grounding\u00a0of the company\u2019s best-selling jets, which\u00a0cost it more than $21 billion. But the design flaws that caused the crashes brought to light questions about the\u00a0decision making process\u00a0at Boeing. Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as \u201cdesigned by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.\u201d The latest safety saga also puts a spotlight on the fact that Boeing most likely doesn\u2019t have to worry about being forced out of business anytime soon, no matter how extensive its mistakes. Boeing and Airbus\u00a0are the only two\u00a0major global aviation companies,  neither company could accommodate all commercial aircraft demand alone, and both have a backlog of orders stretching back years. Boeing\u2019s stock has shed some 8% on Monday as investors grow concerned about more damage to its business. Company shares fell another 1.5% Tuesday.",

            "text": "Two major US airlines are scrambling to deal with cancellations and newly mandated inspections after the Federal Aviation Administration grounded 171 planes in the wake of Friday\u2019s mid-flight blowout aboard an Alaska Airlines flight. That\u2019s when a Boeing 737 Max 9 lost a chunk of its fuselage just minutes into a trip from Portland, Oregon to Ontario, California. The depressurized plane returned safely to the airport but sparked an investigation by federal officials and fresh scrutiny on Boeing and the 737 Max 9 models used by airlines in the US. CNN analyzed industry data to see how the event unfolded. The harrowing journey on Friday, which involved the separation of a plugged door panel during the plane\u2019s ascent from Portland International Airport, began at 5:07 p.m. local time. The airliner climbed initially to 16,300 feet,\u00a0about halfway to a cruising altitude for a commercial flight. Moments later, it descended rapidly, turning from its path and landing at 5:26 pm, according to industry tracker Flightradar 24. As many as 50 seats on the flight were empty, Alaska Airlines has said, including the two immediately next to the hole left in the fuselage by the dislodged door panel. United Airlines operates 78 and Alaska Airlines operates 65 of the Boeing 737 Max 9 models. At least 11 carriers use it worldwide, according to Flightradar 24, though not all of them operate in the US. The FAA-mandated inspections prompted hundreds of flight cancellations from Saturday to Tuesday, according to FlightAware. The inspections were expected to take around four to eight hours per aircraft, the FAA said \u2014\u00a0perhaps keeping the planes grounded for days. Alaska Airlines, for its part, warned of \u201csignificant cancellations\u201d through the first half of this week. Most of those models operating today use a seating configuration that doesn\u2019t require the use of a rear emergency exit door. In those cases, the door is \u201cplugged\u201d \u2014\u00a0as was intended on the Alaska Airlines flight. It was this panel that appears to have dislodged from the aircraft mid-flight. The National Transportation Safety Board said Monday that it had recovered the failed door plug and would send it to a laboratory for examination. The FAA said the aircraft under scrutiny would remain grounded pending inspections to both right and left cabin door plugs and related components and fasteners. \u201cOperators must also complete corrective action requirements based on findings from the inspections prior to bringing any aircraft back into service,\u201d the agency said Monday. In addition to operational disruptions for airlines and passengers, the incident could also ratchet up pressure and scrutiny on Boeing, the plane\u2019s manufacturer. The aviation giant has struggled to regain its reputation following two high-profile and deadly crashes of a previous 737 Max model several years ago. Those crashes, which involved problems with flight operations software and gaps in pilot training, killed more than 340 passengers in 2018 and 2019. They also prompted a 20-month grounding by the FAA and cost Boeing an estimated $20 billion in customer compensation, legal bills and other expenses. United Airlines said Monday that it found \u201cinstallation issues\u201d during preliminary inspections of its fleet conducted over the weekend after the Portland flight, saying that the findings were related to loose bolts in the door plugs. Boeing, whose shares stumbled 8% on Monday, said it would help its customers to address any issues discovered during inspections. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring every Boeing airplane meets design specifications and the highest safety and quality standards,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe regret the impact this has had on our customers and their passengers.\u201d",

            "text": "While Boeing is starting 2024 with yet\u00a0another\u00a0crisis\u00a0about\u00a0its safety and reliability, it reported record orders for the end of 2023 Tuesday. The American plane maker capped its best year since the 737 Max grounding\u00a0in 2019 following two fatal crashes, reporting record new plane orders in December and one of its best years for sales ever. Even more important to its bottom line, since most of the money from selling aircraft is only at the time of delivery, Boeing had the largest number of planes delivered to customers since 2018, the year before the 737 Max grounding kicked off a series of safety and production problems, which together with the pandemic, plunged the company into five years of red ink. But even Boeing\u2019s good news is getting overshadowed by its latest safety problem, the Alaska Air 737 Max that had a window blow out minutes into a flight Friday night, leading to a grounding of its 737 Max 9 jets and additional canceled flights for its airline customers. Boeing is holding an all-hands meeting Tuesday \u2013 not to discuss its strong sales and deliveries, but instead its safety problems. And its successful sales year still left it far behind rival Airbus in both orders and deliveries. Boeing reported 1,456 gross orders for the year, which was one of its best years ever. Adjusted for canceled orders, the annual total came to 1,314 commercial aircraft, its third best year on record by that measure and its best total since 2014. In addition, the company was able to add back more than 200 orders which it had previously classified as unlikely to be completed, which lifted its total net orders to 1,576 jets. It ended the year with 369 total net orders in December, a record month for the company, and a sign that its airline customers have recovered from the pandemic and are eager to add new aircraft to their fleets. Deliveries for the year reached 528 jets, up 10% from 2022, and more than it delivered in 2020 and 2021, combined. Trailing Airbus But the bad news for Boeing is that what used to be a close race with Airbus, the world\u2019s other major commercial jet maker, has turned into a rout. Boeing is now far behind its European rival in both orders and deliveries, with no sign of being able to catch up any time soon. Airbus has yet to report full-year orders and deliveries, but its totals for the first 11 months of the year are far ahead of Boeing\u2019s total, with 1,395 net orders, compared to the 1,314 annual total for Boeing, with one month of orders yet to report at Airbus. Its 11-month delivery total reached 623, or 18% ahead ahead of Boeing\u2019s total. Among the problems putting Boeing in the hole vs Airbus is the challenge of orders and deliveries of passenger jets to China in the face of US-Chinese trade tensions. Boeing did book orders for 18 of its 737 Max jets to China in 2023, but that was its first orders of passenger jets since 2017. And it was a fraction of China\u2019s orders from Airbus. As recently as 2015 it was booked 210 passenger jet orders from Chinese customers. Airbus\u2019 lead is even greater in the single aisle passenger jet portion of the market, which is the best-selling segment of commercial aircraft sales. Boeing\u2019s strength is in widebody jets, used primarily on international routes, and freighter aircraft. The good news for Boeing is that airline customers, once they pick one type of aircraft in a segment of the market, are unlikely to shift to a different version. Operating two types of aircraft in the same segment can significantly increase costs, both for spare parts it needs to keep on hands to make repairs and for training of pilots, who can\u2019t move between aircraft types without new certification. Those training costs can be significant. The fact that Boeing and Airbus\u00a0are the only two\u00a0major global aviation companies means that Boeing probably doesn\u2019t have to worry about being forced out of business, no matter how extensive its mistakes. Neither company could accommodate all commercial aircraft demand, and both have a backlog of orders stretching back years. With the latest orders and deliveries numbers, Boeing\u2019s backlog of orders now stands at 5,626 jets, up from 5,324 a year ago.",

            "title": "New details emerge on piece of Alaska Airlines plane that blew off midflight as investigators probe \u2018explosive decompression\u2019",
            "text": "Federal officials examining the horrifying midflight blowout of part of an Alaska Airlines aircraft\u2019s fuselage are testing the detached piece for clues on what led up to the plane\u2019s \u201cexplosive decompression\u201d after the missing piece was discovered in an Oregon backyard. New details are emerging on the plane\u2019s detached fuselage \u201cplug door\u201d and its components as both Alaska and United Airlines say they found loose hardware on a number of their Boeing 737 Max 9s, which for days have been grounded nationwide for inspections. National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy told CNN\u2019s \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u201d that the fuselage plug that blew out of the plane mid-flight Friday and was recovered from the yard Monday has \u201cquite a lot\u201d it can tell investigators and \u201creally was the missing piece in the investigation.\u201d Investigators have so far determined the components that may have been involved in the refrigerator-sized door plug coming loose, but not yet determined why it blew out. The door plug is typically held in place by a series of stop fittings and has a set of bolts that prevent the door from moving up and potentially flying off the plane mid-flight.\u00a0Somehow, the plug on Alaska 1282 moved upward, NTSB\u2019s Clint Crookshanks explained at a news conference Monday night. \u201cWe have not yet recovered the four bolts that restrain it from his vertical movement and we have not yet determined if they existed there,\u201d Crookshanks said. \u201cThat will be determined when we take the plug to our lab.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know if there were bolts there, or if they are just missing and departed when the door plug departed,\u201d Homendy said at the news conference. The plane\u2019s plug door will be sent to the NTSB\u2019s lab for testing, Homendy said. Plugs are sometimes installed by manufacturer in place of an emergency exit door, depending on the configuration requested by an airline. \u201cWe\u2019re able to look at all the components on this door plug, all the fittings, all \u2013 any sort of structures that may remain,\u201d she said, adding metallurgists and materials engineers will be looking at bolts, washer, nuts and other components of the door. The fuselage plug that blew off the aircraft Friday left a gaping hole in the side of the plane and ripped headrests off seats as the plane flew at 16,000 feet shortly after taking off from Portland, Oregon, carrying 177 people. On Monday, a Portland schoolteacher found the door plug in his backyard and reached out to the NTSB, according to Homendy. Physics teacher Bob Sauer later told reporters he found the door plug intact in a tree\u2019s lower branches, with one edge against the ground. As investigators probe the plug door, unanswered questions remain over previous warnings about the plane\u2019s pressurization and whether other Boeing aircraft are safe to fly. Complicating the NTSB investigation is the loss of critical cockpit audio recordings because of a device setting, Homendy has said. Homendy said the flight crew described the blowout as a \u201cvery violent, explosive event when it occurred\u201d \u2013 something that\u2019s apparent when looking inside the aircraft. There was damage to trim, insulation, windows and seats, she said. Interviews with flight attendants have been very emotional, Homendy said Monday. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of trauma that they are working through. It\u2019s going to be a long process. It was terrifying.\u201d Airlines find loose hardware on Max 9s On Monday, United confirmed it found the loose bolts on an undisclosed number of its 737 Max 9 aircraft as the company is performing FAA-mandated inspections following the Friday incident. \u201cSince we began preliminary inspections on Saturday, we have found instances that appear to relate to installation issues in the door plug \u2013- for example, bolts that needed additional tightening,\u201d United officials said in a statement. The United news was first reported by The Air Current, an aviation industry publication. Alaska Airlines issued a statement later Monday saying technicians who were preparing to conduct their inspections had seen \u201csome loose hardware was visible on some aircraft.\u201d The formal inspection process of Alaska Airlines\u2019 fleet hasn\u2019t started yet as they wait for final documentation from Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration, the statement said. For the NTSB, the focus is on the Alaska Airlines flight involved in Friday\u2019s incident. \u201cOur focus right now is on this aircraft to determine what happened, how it happened and to prevent it from happening again,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cOnce we determine that we can see if there\u2019s a greater concern that we want to issue an urgent safety recommendation for.\u201d NTSB officials will continue the painstaking examination of the interior of the plane and the detached door plug, Homendy said. 171 planes grounded Boeing said it agreed with the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s decision to\u00a0ground the 737 Max 9 planes\u00a0while they are inspected. The order impacts about 171 aircraft \u201cwith a mid-cabin door plug installed.\u201d The FAA said the planes must be parked until emergency inspections are performed, which will \u201ctake around four to eight hours per aircraft.\u201d On Monday, Boeing said it sent airlines and maintenance companies instructions on how to inspect the planes. The FAA confirmed that it has signed off on those instructions. The supplier that makes the fuselage of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max jets, Spirit AeroSystems, said it is working with Boeing on the issue. \u201cWe are grateful the Alaska Airlines crew performed the appropriate procedures to land the airplane with all passengers and crew safe,\u201d the company said in a statement Monday. \u201cAt Spirit AeroSystems, our primary focus is the quality and product integrity of the aircraft structures we deliver.\u201d Alaska Airlines has also said it is working with Boeing to understand what happened on Flight 1282. United, which has more Max 9s than any other US carrier, has canceled more than 470 flights since Saturday because of the Max 9 inspections. The inspection process requires removing two rows of seats and interior aircraft panels and requires five technicians, according to United. Plane was restricted from flying over water amid auto pressurization fail lights The airline had restricted the aircraft in Friday\u2019s incident from flying over the ocean to Hawaii to ensure the plane could \u201creturn very quickly to an airport\u201d in case any warning lights in the aircraft went off, according to Homendy. That decision came after the plane\u2019s auto pressurization fail light came on three times in the past month, Homendy said. It\u2019s not clear whether there is a connection between the warning lights and Friday\u2019s incident, she noted. \u201cAt this time, we have no indications whatsoever that this correlated in any way to the expulsion of the door plug and the rapid decompression,\u201d Homendy said of the pressurization fail lights in a Monday update. While the repeated pressurization alert is \u201cvery disconcerting to investigators,\u201d who are looking into the issue with Boeing and Alaska Airlines, Homendy said, \u201cit may have absolutely nothing to do with what occurred in the cabin of the aircraft during that event.\u201d The fail light came on December 7 and on January 3 and 4 \u2013- the days leading up to the blowout, she said. Each time, the flight crew flipped a switch to the system\u2019s backup, Homendy said, describing the move as \u201cvery normal.\u201d \u201cThey flipped it, they reported it, it was tested by maintenance and then reset.\u201d \u201cThey did order additional maintenance to look at the light that was not complete before (the fuselage blowout). We plan to look at that more and we\u2019ve requested documentation on all defects since delivery of the aircraft on October 31,\u201d she said. Homendy noted Monday that Alaska Airlines\u2019 restriction on flying over water was not required by regulation. It was \u201cput in place for Alaska as an extra step to ensure safety and to allow them to conduct maintenance.\u201d The plane involved in\u00a0Friday\u2019s incident had been in service for\u00a0about three months\u00a0and flown about 150 times since October 2023, according to FlightAware\u00a0and FAA records. Crew interviews, interior damage\u00a0illustrate terrifying scene Interviews with flight crew and the examinations of the damage left behind inside the cabin shed light on the loud, \u201cviolent\u201d and chaotic scene inside the aircraft when the door plug tore off, causing an incredibly forceful depressurization and sending flight attendants rushing to the side of children on the flight, the NTSB chief said. After the \u201cexplosive event,\u201d flight attendants scrambled to ensure four unaccompanied minors onboard were wearing oxygen masks and lap belts, Homendy said, praising the attendants as \u201cheroic.\u201d In the cockpit,\u00a0the captain and the first officer heard a bang, then felt some air and some pressure changes in their ears and the cockpit door flew open. A flight attendant rushed to try and close it, Homendy said. The captain and first officer described a very loud, chaotic environment, saying they had trouble hearing each other and air traffic control, according to Homendy. The cockpit door was designed to open during rapid decompression \u2013 but flight attendants didn\u2019t know that, Homendy said in a Monday night update. \u201cBoeing is going to make some changes to the manual, which then hopefully will translate into procedures and information for the flight attendants and for the crew in the cockpit,\u201d Homendy added. Several guests on the flight were injured and required medical attention but had all since been medically cleared, the airline said in a Saturday statement. But \u201ccommunication was a serious issue\u201d between the pilots and flight attendants, who said they were having difficulty quickly sharing information, she added. \u201cI do want to emphasize that the actions of the flight crew were really incredible,\u201d she said. The impact of the event caused damage to the interior paneling, trim and plastic around the windows inside the plane, all of which are \u201cnot critical\u201d to the aircraft\u2019s structure, Homendy said. The damage extended to several rows on the plane \u2013 not just the row next to the hole, according to Homendy. The two seats next to the door plug \u2013 26A and 26B \u2013 were empty when the blowout happened, but had their headrests torn off, she said previously. The back of 26A is completely gone. There was no structural damage to the aircraft and airframe, she noted. Cockpit recorder setting wipes crucial evidence The cockpit voice recorder, which captures sounds such as engine noises and pilots\u2019 voices, was \u201ccompletely overwritten,\u201d since devices are currently only required to retain two hours of audio at a time, Homendy said. \u201cThere is nothing on the cockpit voice recorder,\u201d she said, noting the maintenance team went out to get the recorder around the two-hour mark when the devices begin a new recording cycle. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that the cockpit voice recorder was overwritten,\u201d Homendy said Monday. The audio captured by the recorders is \u201ccritical\u201d to helping investigators understand what occurred during the incident, Homendy said. Without it, there is no record of communications between pilots and flight attendants as the crisis was unfolding. \u201cIf that communication is not recorded, that is, unfortunately, a loss for (the NTSB), and a loss for the FAA and a loss for safety because that information is key not just for our investigation, but for improving aviation safety,\u201d Homendy said. Though the Federal Aviation Administration has proposed a new rule that would require new aircraft to extend their cockpit voice recordings to 25 hours, the rule would not require older aircraft to be retrofitted, Homendy noted. The NTSB chief called on the FAA and Congress to require 25-hour recordings in all aircraft. \u201cI cannot emphasize enough how important that is for safety,\u201d she said. CNN asked Alaska Airlines about about the wiped cockpit audio and the airline\u2019s previous decision to restrict the plane from flying from over the ocean. The company replied in a statement Monday: \u201cBecause this is an active investigation, we must receive permission from the NTSB to provide information about the aircraft and its prior maintenance,\u201d Alaska Airlines said. \u201cWe have asked for permission from the NTSB to address these questions \u2013 they will not permit us to comment at this time. We will provide information as soon as the NTSB gives us permission to do so.\u201d Fallen cell phones may provide insight Two cell phones that were likely flung from the plane were found in a yard and on the side of a road and turned in to investigators, who may be able to use them as evidence, Homendy said. \u201cCell phones have actually helped us determine some things that occurred after tragedies \u2026 But it also helps in telling us, \u2018Are we looking in the right area?,\u201d the agency chief said just minutes before finding out the door plug had been discovered. Sean Bates told CNN he spotted a phone on an Oregon roadside and turned it over to the NTSB, who were already in the area investigating the accident. The phone didn\u2019t have a security lock, and a photo of the phone shows an emailed Alaska Airlines baggage receipt for two bags, Bates said. NTSB spokesman Jennifer Gabris told CNN that the agency took custody of the phone Sunday and has since turned the phone over to Alaska Airlines. Community members also found a plastic window frame\u00a0and a headrest and turned them into the NTSB, Homendy said Monday. The agency is still looking for a bottom hinge fitting and springs that were part of the door plug, she\u00a0said, though noting those pieces aren\u2019t critical to the investigation.

            "text": "A Boeing\u00a0737 Max 9 earned its certificate of airworthiness on October 25, six days before it found its home with Alaska Airlines. Over the next three months \u2013 before a terrifying midair blowout and emergency landing \u2013 it would fly more than 150 times. A few of those flights would tip off airline officials to a possible problem with the aircraft\u2019s pressurization, a federal official later would say. It even would be restricted from traveling over the ocean \u2013 to Hawaii \u2013 in case such a warning appeared. Still, nothing any ordinary passenger could notice would distinguish Friday\u2019s Flight 1282 to Southern California, from any other. Nothing would signal the nationwide grounding of similar aircraft the plane would trigger just a few days into the new year. Indeed, nothing would foretell the terror this plane soon would hold in the sky above Portland, Oregon. Emergency lights tested and reset Some 37 days after it joined the Alaska Airlines fleet, an auto pressurization \u201cfail light\u201d in the Boeing 737 Max 9 lit up. It happened again on January 3. Then, again on January 4. Each time, the flight crew flipped a switch to the system\u2019s backup, National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy later said, describing the move as \u201cvery normal.\u201d \u201cThey flipped it, they reported it, it was tested by maintenance and then reset,\u201d she explained. Then Friday, 171 passengers and six crew members boarded the Alaska Airlines flight in Portland, Oregon, bound for Ontario, California, which took off at about 5:07 p.m, according to FlightAware. Among them were four unaccompanied minors. Of the 220 passenger seats on the aircraft, just under 50 seats were empty, including seats 26A and 26B. Abruptly after take off, a panel of the plane\u2019s main body called the fuselage \u201cplug door,\u201d including a window, popped off and was sent flying into the air at 16,000 feet, a passenger told CNN. With a boom, the fuselage plug \u2013 which looks like the typical interior of a commercial jet \u2013 blew off the plane, ripping headrests off seats and sucking items out of the aircraft, including a boy\u2019s shirt which was ripped clean off his body, according to passenger accounts and video. Unsure of what had just happened, some passengers screamed and cried and began drafting text messages to their loved ones, in case it was their last \u2013 all while a gush of air entered the plane and oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling. Nick Hoch, a 33-year-old passenger, called the ordeal \u201ctraumatic,\u201d \u201ctense,\u201d and \u201cjarring,\u201d in a phone interview with CNN. \u201cA mist or cloud whooshed past me that kind of hit me in the face,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople\u2019s hair was flying all over the place.\u201d Feeling disoriented himself, he said it was clear others felt the same sense of fear. Hoch was on the left side of the plane, a few rows in front of where the panel blew off. Miraculously, no passengers were assigned to 26A and 26B, the two plane seats right next to the plug door that blew off, Alaska Airlines confirmed. Stephanie King, another passenger aboard the flight, was in an aisle seat in row 12 on the flight to her home in California and said she heard a load roar of wind. Even though King was a few rows removed from 26A and 26B, she told CNN Saturday she \u201cjust knew that something bad had happened.\u201d \u201cOne of the ladies was screaming and crying,\u201d King said. \u201cShe was inconsolable. She kept saying \u2018My son! My son! He got his shirt ripped off!\u2019 It was absolutely surreal.\u201d Emma Vu, another passenger, was asleep and woke up to a falling sensation and seeing emergency masks drop down, she told CNN. She apparently woke up after the panel section popped off; it wasn\u2019t clear how close to the missing panel she was. Vu texted her parents their code word for emergencies to let them know about the incident. \u201cI\u2019ve never had to use it before, but I knew that this was that moment,\u201d she said. After a portion of the plane flew off, people appeared \u201cremarkably calm\u201d as they listened to instruction from the flight crew, Hoch said. But King says even though flight attendants were making announcements, because the plane was open, it was too loud for her to hear much of what was being said. When the part blew out, \u201cchaos\u201d ensued, Homendy explained, relating a firsthand account from a flight attendant. Due to the change in pressure, the cockpit door came open and slammed into the lavatory door, she said. \u201cThe first officer lost her headset at that moment, it was pulled off. The captain had a portion of the headset pulled off,\u201d and a laminated procedural checklist flew out into the cabin. \u201cWe\u2019d like to get down,\u201d the pilot told air traffic control, according to a recording posted on\u00a0liveatc.net. \u201cWe are declaring an emergency. We do need to come down to 10,000.\u201d Within 20 minutes of takeoff, Alaska Airlines flight 1282, did get down and landed safely. One person was taken to the hospital, several were injured and required medical attention, but all have since been medically cleared. Ripple effects of nationwide grounding continue to mount amid investigation On Saturday, the FAA ordered all Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft to be grounded nationwide until they are carefully inspected. Hundreds of flights from major airlines including Alaska and United have been canceled. Neither the airlines nor the FAA have indicated when the planes might return to service. So far, 18 of Alaska\u2019s 737-9 Max aircraft that were operating on Saturday after being inspected have again been pulled from service \u201cuntil details about possible additional maintenance work are confirmed with the FAA,\u201d the airline said. Now, as the investigation into the incident continues, further complicating it is the loss of critical cockpit audio recordings because of a device setting, Homendy said. The cockpit voice recorder, which captures sounds such as engine noises and pilots\u2019 voices, was \u201ccompletely overwritten.\u201d The devices are currently only required to retain two hours of audio at a time, she explained in a news conference. The refrigerator-size fuselage door plug was missing for a time, but was later found in the yard of a schoolteacher named Bob in Portland. And although it\u2019s unclear if there is any correlation between the warning lights and Friday\u2019s incident, for the dozens of passengers aboard Alaska Airlines flight 1282, nothing about what they experienced on their flight was normal. While the repeated pressurization alert is \u201cvery disconcerting to investigators,\u201d who are looking into the issue with Boeing and Alaska Airlines, Homendy said, \u201cit may have absolutely nothing to do with what occurred in the cabin of the aircraft during that event,\u201d adding the light itself may be faulty. Unanswered questions remain over previous warnings about the plane\u2019s pressurization and whether other Boeing aircraft are safe to fly. \u201cOur focus right now is on this aircraft to determine what happened, how it happened and to prevent it from happening again,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cOnce we determine that, we can see if there\u2019s a greater concern that we want to issue an urgent safety recommendation for.\u201d NTSB officials will continue the painstaking examination of the interior of the plane and will recover and examine the detached door plug, Homendy said. The supplier that makes the fuselage of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max jets, Spirit AeroSystems, said it is working with Boeing on the issue. Alaska Airlines has also said it is working with Boeing to understand what happened.

On February 12, Joanna Geraghty will take over as CEO and will join the company\u2019s board. She\u2019s worked at JetBlue for nearly 20 years and was named president and COO in 2018. She has also held different vice president positions and led JetBlue\u2019s litigation and regulatory affairs. Hayes is stepping down after taking advice from his doctor and speaking with his wife, as \u201cthe extraordinary challenges and pressure of this job have taken their toll.\u201d He will continue serving on JetBlue\u2019s board of directors until his departure and will serve as a strategic advisor over the coming months. \u201cWith a rigorous succession plan in place, the board and I are confident that Joanna is more than ready given her critical role in running JetBlue\u2019s day-to-day business and positioning the airline for success,\u201d Hayes said in a statement. \u201cShe guided the operation through the most turbulent time in airline history, has overseen the development and execution of new commercial initiatives, and has tirelessly worked to make JetBlue a better place for our crewmembers and customers.\u201d Hayes has led JetBlue as CEO for nine years.

            "text": "Shares of Boeing and one of its key suppliers dropped sharply on Monday as investors grew worried about possible damage to the businesses after a piece of fuselage on a Boeing 737 Max 9 blew out mid-flight. The Alaska Airlines flight, which had been travelling from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, on Friday, made an emergency landing after part of the wall of the aircraft detached itself, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. The cause of the incident has not been determined. The Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday ordered all Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft to be grounded until they can be carefully inspected. The order applies to 171 planes around the world, and airlines in Turkey and Panama have also grounded flights. Aviation trial attorney Robert Clifford told CNN the incident will have reputational repercussions for Boeing and the company will likely be on the hook to pay airlines for lost revenue. Boeing (BA) shares dropped more than 8% on Monday, while shares of aerospace supplier Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) fell by about 11%. The company manufactured and completed the initial installation of part of the plane\u2019s fuselage, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources. Spirit did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares of Alaska Air Group declined 0.2%. Meanwhile, United Airlines on Monday said it found loose door plug bolts on an undisclosed number of its Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft during its FAA-mandated inspections of the aircrafts following the Alaska Airlines incident. \u201cSince we began preliminary inspections on Saturday, we have found instances that appear to relate to installation issues in the door plug \u2014 for example, bolts that needed additional tightening,\u201d United Airlines said in a statement. Shares of United rose 2.8% on Monday. Advantage Airbus The incident is the latest in a long string of problems for Boeing. Since the\u00a0grounding of the 737 Max\u00a0in March 2019, following\u00a0two crashes\u00a0that killed 346 people, Boeing\u2019s financial losses have mounted. The company reported an annual loss for four straight years from 2019 to 2022, and logged a $2.2 billion net loss for the first nine months of last year. Its full-year results for 2023 are due at the end of January. Boeing\u2019s share price has recovered since the pandemic threw the global airline industry into turmoil but is still down about 34% from its peak in February 2020. In comparison, shares in Airbus, Boeing\u2019s European rival, are trading above their pre-pandemic peak, rose 2.5%\ufeff from their previous close in Paris on Monday. Together, Airbus and Boeing dominate the global aviation market. But Airbus overtook its American counterpart in 2018 in the number of jets it delivered to customers, and has stayed out in front ever since. In 2023, Airbus delivered 623 jets to customers within the first 11 months, compared with 461 for Boeing. Airbus will announce its full-year deliveries on Thursday, a company spokesperson told CNN. \ufeffSome of Boeing\u2019s woes have been beyond its control. Trade tensions between the US and China have largely closed off that key growth market. But the company has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft over the past five years. Ten days ago, Boeing asked airlines to inspect all of their 737 Max jets for\u00a0loose bolts in the rudder system, after an unnamed international carrier discovered a potential problem with the key part on two aircraft. \u2014CNN\u2019s Krystal Hur, Pete Muntean and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.",

            "text": "Boeing used to have a reputation for unmatched safety and quality in its commercial jets. No longer. The terrifying accident aboard a 10-week-old 737 Max 9 flight Friday night is only the latest in what has been a long line of safety and quality control questions about Boeing aircraft. Stunningly, no one was killed or seriously injured when a piece of the plane ripped out of the side of the fuselage only a few minutes into the flight from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, sending some of the contents of the plane hurling into the void. \u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that nobody died and there were not more serious injuries,\u201d\u00a0Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Safety Transportation Board (NTSB), told CNN. Investigators continue to comb through data and eyewitness accounts and examine the jet itself. Early details from the NTSB are harrowing: Homendy said that the headrests from seat 26A \u2014 which is immediately next to the refrigerator-sized hole in the plane\u2019s left side \u2014 as well as seat 25A in front of it, were missing. Seats structures are twisted, Homendy said, oxygen masks are dangling and there is a piece of clothing caught up in the hole by the missing door plug that separated from the airplane. \u201cThe video looks very calm, but I\u2019m sure it was completely chaotic and very loud,\u201d Homendy said, referring to videos taken by passengers. The cause of the accident has not been determined. The plane\u2019s auto pressurization fail light had illuminated three times in the past month, Homendy said, noting it is unclear if there is any correlation between the warning lights and the Friday incident. On Monday, United Airlines said it found loose bolts on the same part of an undisclosed number of its 737 Max 9 planes. The airline said the problem appears to be an installation issue. \u201cAs operators conduct the required inspections, we are staying in close contact with them and will help address any and all findings,\u201d Boeing said in a statement. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring every Boeing airplane meets design specifications and the highest safety and quality standards. We regret the impact this has had on our customers and their passengers.\u201d But the Alaska Airlines plane was put into service in October. The fact that the plane is essentially brand new suggests it could ultimately be Boeing\u2019s fault and not the maintenance crew at Alaska Airlines, said Richard Aboulafia,\u00a0managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace and defense management consultancy based in Michigan. The only good news for Boeing is that \u201cit\u2019s almost certainly not a design issue,\u201d said Aboulafia. But that doesn\u2019t absolve the aircraft maker, he said. \u201cThat leaves us almost certainly with the production process,\u201d he said. Boeing said it agreed with the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) decision to ground all 737 Max 9 planes while they are inspected. On Monday, Boeing said it sent airlines and maintenance companies instructions on how to inspect the planes. The FAA, Boeing\u2019s primary regulator, faces intense scrutiny of its own over a recent series\u00a0of airline delays and near misses between planes, as well as criticism for giving aircraft makers too much freedom to regulate themselves during the certification process. But the company, for five years, has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and the halt in deliveries of others. Boeing\u2019s (BA) stock tumbled nearly 9% in premarket trading Monday as investors grow concerned about more damage to its business. The most glaring quality problems for Boeing came with the 737 Max\u2019s design, which was judged to be responsible for two fatal crashes: one in Indonesia in October 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019. Together, the two crashes killed all 346 people aboard the two flights and led to a 20-month grounding of the company\u2019s best-selling jets, which cost it more than $21 billion. But the design flaws that caused the crashes brought to light questions about the decision making process at Boeing. Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as \u201cdesigned by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.\u201d Two other employees agreed that they would not allow their family members to fly on the plane. Boeing\u2019s release of the documents included an apology to the FAA, Congress, airlines and their passengers. The company said it would hold an all-employee meeting on Tuesday \u201cfocused on safety\u201d at the 737 Max factory in Renton, Washington. On Monday, the company sent a memo to staff, encouraging people to think about safety by: \u201cAsking ourselves what we can do individually and collectively to make safety and first-time quality the priority in all aspects of our business.\u201d Quality problems go beyond 737 Max The problems with the Max are only part of the quality control issues that have dogged the company. It had to twice halt deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, for about a year starting in 2021 and again in 2023, due to quality concerns cited by the FAA.\u00a0And the 777 jet also suffered a grounding after an engine failure on a United flight scattered engine debris onto homes and ground below. Some of those problems, such as the engine issues on the 777, were attributed to Boeing suppliers. But Boeing has worked to cut the costs it pays suppliers in recent years, such as those that make its fuselages and engines. Aboulafia suggested that effort could have contributed to the series of quality control problems with its planes. The company did not respond to a request for comment on whether the Alaska Airlines flight was linked to Boeing\u2019s recent quality problems. The problem with the Alaska Airlines 737 Max flight isn\u2019t the first problem since the plane was returned to service three years ago following the grounding. Just this past December, Boeing asked airlines to inspect all of their 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system, after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft. Whenever a new problem occurs, Boeing insists that safety and quality are the company\u2019s number one priority. \u201cSafety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers,\u201d said Boeing after the Alaska Airlines accident. A lost reputation for safety and quality It wasn\u2019t long ago that Boeing had an unmatched reputation for quality and safety.\u00a0\u201cIf it\u2019s not Boeing, I\u2019m not going,\u201d used to be an expression to express the trust passengers and airline crews placed in the aircraft maker\u2019s quality. Boeing still sells T-shirts and coffee mugs bearing that expression, which no longer rings true for many passengers. It\u2019s not easy to say when things started to change at Boeing. Some aviation industry experts point to a 1997 merger with McDonnnell Douglas that eventually gave the company top executives who were not former engineers as past Boeing leadership had been. Others point to the decision to move corporate headquarters away from its Pacific Northwest roots, first to Chicago in 2001 and then to Arlington, Virginia, in 2022, near the Pentagon and across the Potomac from Washington, DC. And Boeing\u2019s quality control problems haven\u2019t been limited to its commercial aircraft unit. Many of its military aircraft have also had quality issues that required the company to take large charges against earnings. The most-high profile of those problems includes two new 747 jets being reconfigured to be the next Air Force One presidential jets. Boeing has disclosed more than $2 billion in losses on those two planes alone. Its space efforts badly trail those of Elon Musk\u2019s upstart SpaceX, as its Starliner spacecraft designed to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station has yet to have a crewed flight because of a series of errors, delays and failures. Its first crewed flight is now scheduled for later this year, but that would come four years after SpaceX first carried astronauts to the space station. Quality issues hit bottom line As recently as 2019, the company was reporting strong sales and profits, topping $100 billion in revenue for the first, and maybe only, time in its history. But it has fallen badly behind rival Airbus since then, especially in the key market for single-aisle jets, such as the 737 Max. Some problems are beyond its control, such as the China-US trade tensions killing demand for its jets in the crucial China market. But many of these quality problems have angered airline customers, which have grown frustrated by the delays and groundings affecting their own expansion plans. In 2022, Michael O\u2019Leary, CEO of Ryanair, Europe\u2019s largest discount carrier and a key Boeing customer, let loose a public expletive-filled rant at Boeing management, saying they needed to \u201cget their s*** together\u201d and that company executives need either an immediate \u201creboot, or a boot up the a**.\u201d The delivery and production problems have resulted in the company reporting only one profitable quarter since 2019, and it\u2019s not clear when it will report an annual profit again. The fact that Boeing and Airbus are the only two major global aviation companies means that Boeing probably doesn\u2019t have to worry about being forced out of business, no matter how extensive its mistakes. Neither company could accommodate all commercial aircraft demand, and both have a backlog of orders stretching back years. But the problems have meant that Boeing continues to fall further behind Airbus. Boeing had to postpone plans for its next-generation jet, popularly known as the Boeing 797, which was supposed to offer airlines a mid-size, long-distance jet to compete with the Airbus A321XLR. And it has delayed plans to begin production of the next version of the 777, the 777X, which was originally due to start delivery to customers by the end of last year. Now Boeing won\u2019t be delivering the first 777X until at least 2025. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Pete Muntean, Gregory Wallace and Jackie Wattles contributed to this report",

The historic mission could set the tone for NASA to explore the lunar surface for the first time in more than 50 years. Here\u2019s what else you need to know to\u00a0Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Boeing The missing part of the Alaska Airlines aircraft that blew off mid-flight has been found in a backyard in Portland. A schoolteacher reached out to the National Transportation Safety Board after he found the missing Boeing 737 MAX 9 fuselage door plug in his yard, the agency said. Federal investigators had been searching for the missing part since it blew off the aircraft after taking off from Portland on Friday. By Saturday, the FAA ordered all Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft to be grounded until they are carefully inspected. Meanwhile, the FAA \u2014 Boeing\u2019s primary regulator \u2014 faces intense scrutiny of its own over a recent series of airline delays and near misses between planes, as well as criticism for giving aircraft makers too much freedom to regulate themselves during the certification process. 2. Presidential race The 2024 Republican presidential candidates are making their final pushes in Iowa with just one week left until the critical caucuses. A furious scramble is underway between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to emerge as the leading alternative to former President Donald Trump, who remains the frontrunner in the polls. Former Vice President Mike Pence told CNN on Sunday that the upcoming Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary present Republicans an opportunity for \u201cnew leadership\u201d in the party. He also denounced the debunked conspiracy theory that the FBI instigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. 3. Israel Secretary of State Antony Blinken is visiting the Middle East for a weeklong trip aimed at de-escalating tensions in the region. Blinken is holding talks with officials about the next phase of Israel\u2019s military campaign and post-war plans for Gaza as the conflict surpasses the three-month mark. On Sunday, Israel\u2019s president said the resettlement of Palestinians out of Gaza is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d Israel\u2019s position. It comes after some Israeli Cabinet members called for the forced displacement of Palestinians in parts of the Strip. The UN says that nearly 90% of the 2 million people living in Gaza have been forcibly displaced from the enclave since the October 7 Hamas attack. 4. Winter Storm A whirlwind of winter weather is in store for the Southeast today where a powerful storm is set to deliver heavy rain and the threat of tornadoes before creating headaches for those farther north. Around 70 million people are at risk for severe weather through at least Tuesday, according to the Storm Prediction Center \u2014 with a Level 3 of 5 enhanced risk today for cities including New Orleans, Gulfport, Mississippi and Mobile, Alabama. The storm already made its way through the Four Corners region on Sunday, causing treacherous travel conditions. It also arrives just a day after a winter storm dumped more than a foot of snow on the Northeast, which brought snow, ice and even a tornado as it tracked from the Gulf Coast to Maine. 5. Golden Globes The 81st annual Golden Globe Awards were held Sunday night in Los Angeles, honoring the best in film and television. Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d swept the major movie categories, including wins for best movie, best director and two acting awards. \u201cBarbie\u201d was the most nominated film ahead of the ceremony, but picked up just two awards \u2014 one of which was in a category that recognizes films that combine box-office success with cinematic achievement.

FlightAware, an airline tracking service, said 138 Alaska flights were cancelled Monday, amounting to 20% of its schedule. The cancellations come after the 737 Max 9 grounding weighed heavily on the airline\u2019s operation on Sunday, with about 170 flights cancelled, according to an Alaska Air statement. Alaska Airlines, which has 65 737 Max 9 aircraft in its fleet, said it can\u2019t return the planes to service until the US Federal Aviation Administration provides details about how to inspect the planes. \u201cWhile we await the airworthiness directive inspection criteria from the FAA and Boeing, our maintenance teams are prepared and ready to perform the required inspections,\u201d the\u00a0airline said in a statement.

A federal investigation has been launched. The FAA said its grounding directive will impact 171 planes around the world. Even though some of the affected airlines\u2019 fleets comprise hundreds of planes, temporary flight suspensions can still put strain on travelers as operators scramble to fix scheduling issues. Rescheduling depends on a variety of factors. Airlines with larger fleets will generally have an easier time shuffling aircraft around to meet customer demand. Airlines with smaller fleets and airlines relying more heavily on the affected planes could find it more difficult. Location can also play a role. Airports capable of supporting a larger number of aircraft are more likely to have spare planes to replace the grounded ones.

            "text": "Find the latest on the Alaska Airlines investigation here.  The missing part of the Alaska Airlines aircraft that blew off mid-flight has been found in a backyard in Portland, the National Transportation Safety Board announced. A Portland school teacher named Bob reached out to the agency after he found the missing Boeing 737 MAX 9 fuselage door plug in his yard, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said at a news conference. Federal investigators had been searching for the door plug since it blew off an Alaska Airlines aircraft after taking off from Portland on Friday, leading to the nationwide grounding of certain Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft and a slew of flight cancellations. The agency had asked for the public\u2019s help finding the part and had plans of possibly using a helicopter or drones to continue the search Sunday. Homendy had explained locating the missing part would provide key clues as to why it separated from the airplane. Federal investigators earlier had released their first image\u00a0from\u00a0inside\u00a0the aircraft that was left with a refrigerator-sized hole mid-flight,\u00a0and it shows\u00a0a headrest torn\u00a0from a nearby\u00a0seat and oxygen masks still hanging from the plane\u2019s ceiling. No passengers during the Friday flight were seated directly next to the section of the plane that blew off, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that nobody died and there were not more serious injuries,\u201d Homendy told CNN after touring the aircraft. Investigators were preparing to interview the flight crew, she said. The refrigerator-sized hole that suddenly opened up on the aircraft carrying 177 people from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, Friday sent panic throughout the plane as the cabin depressurized, oxygen masks descended and passengers screamed and texted their goodbyes. The plane landed safely with no serious injuries reported, authorities said. The ordeal resulted in the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s decision to temporarily ground certain Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft until they are carefully inspected. Boeing has faced a string of setbacks in recent years, most notably a 2019 grounding in dozens of countries following two tragic crashes. Alaska Airlines said Saturday night that emergency inspections of its fleet of Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes \u201cwill take more time,\u201d warning flight disruptions will likely continue. The number of Alaska Airlines cancellations has added up since the ordeal. The airline said Saturday afternoon that 160 flights \u2014 affecting roughly 23,000 travelers \u2014 had been canceled. In a Sunday update, the airline said 170 flights that day had been canceled and another 60 had been axed for Monday. \u201cCancellations will continue through the first half of the week, and we encourage guests with travel plans to continue to check their email and\u00a0alaskaair.com\u00a0for updates,\u201d the airline said. United Airlines also saw triple-digit cancellations with 270 flights axed this weekend, according to the airline. United said it also suspended services on all its Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft and was \u201cworking with the FAA to clarify the inspection process and the requirements for returning all MAX 9 aircraft to service.\u201d United said it has 79 of the aircraft in its fleet. In the meantime, investigators are beginning to dig into the Alaska plane\u2019s maintenance records, among other components, as they look into the mishap. On Tuesday, Boeing is scheduled to hold an all-employee meeting at its 737 Max factory in Renton, Washington, \u201cfocused on safety\u201d and the company\u2019s response to the accident, Boeing President and CEO David Calhoun said in a company-wide email. \u201cIt is critical for us to work transparently with our customers and regulators to understand and address the causes of the event and to ensure they don\u2019t happen again,\u201d Calhoun said in the email. Seat headrests were blown off Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 had reached 16,000 feet after taking off from Portland when the chaos unfolded. The plane was airborne for only about 20 minutes, according to the flight-tracking site\u00a0FlightAware. With a boom, the fuselage plug \u2013 which looks like the typical interior of a commercial jet from inside the airplane \u2013 blew off the plane, sucking items out the aircraft, according to video and passenger accounts. Some planes have an intentional opening that can be covered with a plug or an emergency door, depending on the seating configuration ordered by the airline. Miraculously, no one was sitting in 26A and 26B, the two plane seats right next to the plug door that blew off, Homendy said Saturday night. Alaska Airlines confirmed that no passengers were assigned to those seats. The force of the sudden depressurization of the passenger cabin ripped headrests and cushions off seats, Homendy told CNN. The back of the seat on 26A is completely gone, as are the headrests from seats 25A and 26A, Homendy said. Clothes were also scattered in the area. Seat assemblies are twisted, Homendy said, oxygen masks are dangling, and there is a piece of clothing caught up in the hole by the missing door plug that separated from the airplane. \u201cThe video looks very calm, but I\u2019m sure it was completely chaotic and very loud,\u201d Homendy said. What also prevented a more disastrous outcome was that it happened before the plane reached cruising altitude, when passengers typically begin unbuckling and walking around, Homendy said. Still, the incident spread panic on the plane. Passenger Nick Hoch, 33, described hearing a \u201cboom\u201d before the plane \u201cjolted.\u201d \u201cWe had our oxygen masks fall from the top and we put those on immediately, but it was a disorienting experience,\u201d Hoch told CNN on Saturday. Hoch said he was sitting on the left side of the plane, a few rows in front of where the panel blew off and \u201ca mist or cloud whooshed past me that kind of hit me in the face.\u201d \u201cThere were people much closer who I spoke with who lost AirPods out of their ears,\u201d he said. Several guests onboard the plane required medical attention due to injuries, and all \u201chave now been medically cleared,\u201d Alaska Airlines said in Saturday night\u2019s statement. \u201cI imagine this was a pretty terrifying event,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cWe don\u2019t often talk about psychological injury, but I\u2019m sure that occurred here.\u201d Alaska Airlines said it was working with Boeing to understand what happened on Flight 1282.  The Boeing\u00a0737 MAX 9 involved in\u00a0Friday\u2019s incident has been in service for about three months and has flown about 150 times since October 2023, according to FlightAware\u00a0and Federal Aviation Administration records. Alaska Airlines said it inspected 18 of the Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes in its fleet Saturday and returned those to service, but hours later, reversed course and said those aircraft would be removed \u201cuntil details about possible additional maintenance work are confirmed with the FAA.\u201d Final texts to loved ones Stephanie King\u00a0told CNN she\u00a0was in an aisle seat in row 12 on the flight to her home in California when she heard a loud roar of wind. \u201cI just knew that something bad had happened,\u201d she told CNN by phone Saturday. King said flight attendants made announcements, but because the plane was open, it was too loud for her to hear much of what was being said. Several passengers closer to the hole in the plane were frantic and moved to empty seats away from the incident, King told CNN. \u201cOne of the ladies was screaming and crying. She was inconsolable. She kept saying, \u2018My son! My son! He got his shirt ripped off!\u2019\u201d King said. \u201cIt was absolutely surreal.\u201d Fearing for her safety, King took out her phone to record video and draft final text messages to her loved ones. \u201cI drafted some text messages to my boyfriend and my mom to say something was going on, that I was scared and I love them,\u201d she said. Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX jets had previous issues According to Alaska Airlines, in the days before the incident, pilots had filed several reports of warning lights that indicated a loss of some cabin pressure and the plane was restricted from long-distance flights over water as a result, The Seattle Times\u00a0reported. Homendy told CNN she is aware that there were pressurization issues with the plane prior to the incident, and investigators will be asking what Alaska Airlines mechanics did to rectify them.\u00a0She said investigators also plan to review the onboard\u00a0aircraft maintenance records. Alaska Airlines has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. After the FAA ordered the temporary grounding\u00a0of Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft in light of the Alaska Airlines incident, Boeing said the company supported the FAA\u2019s decision. \u201cSafety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers,\u201d Boeing said in a statement. \u201cWe agree with and fully support the FAA\u2019s decision to require immediate inspections of 737-9 airplanes with the same configuration as the affected airplane.\u201d The latest grounding comes after a series of setbacks for Boeing. Last month, Boeing asked airlines to\u00a0inspect all of their 737 MAX jets\u00a0for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft. Boeing\u2019s engineering and quality problems have\u00a0posed major challenges\u00a0for the company. The crashes of two of 737-8 MAX jets that\u00a0killed all 346 people\u00a0on board the flights led to a crippling\u00a020-month grounding\u00a0of the plane. The Max returned to the air carrying passengers in most markets around the globe beginning in\u00a0late December 2020. But it has encountered other problems, including in April when Boeing said it has discovered a manufacturing issue with some\u00a0737 MAX aircraft\u00a0after a supplier used a \u201cnon-standard manufacturing process\u201d during the installation of two fittings in the rear fuselage \u2013 although Boeing insisted the problem did not constitute a safety risk.

            "text": "Alaska Airlines says emergency inspections of its fleet of Boeing 737 Max 9 planes mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration \u201cwill take more time,\u201d warning flight disruptions will likely continue after the terrifying incident aboard one of its flights in which a section of the plane blew off the aircraft mid-flight. The FAA on Saturday had ordered all Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft to be grounded until they are carefully inspected. Eighteen of Alaska\u2019s 737-9 MAX aircraft that were operating on Saturday after being inspected have now also been pulled from service \u201cuntil details about possible additional maintenance work are confirmed with the FAA,\u201d the airline said. \u201cWe are working with the FAA to ensure that our inspections meet their detailed requirements and comply with the EAD, but this process will take more time,\u201d Alaska Airlines said in a statement Saturday night. Alaska Airlines had announced earlier Saturday about a quarter of its Boeing 737 Max 9 fleet, 18 planes, were cleared to operate because they \u201chad in-depth and thorough plug door inspections performed as part of a recent heavy maintenance visit.\u201d But the airline later pulled the planes from service after the FAA ordered its emergency airworthiness directive, Alaska Airlines said Saturday night. The airline had canceled 160 flights \u2013 affecting roughly 23,000 customers \u2013 as of Saturday afternoon, and more cancellations could be in store for Sunday. \u201cWe are identifying necessary cancellations for tomorrow and expect the disruption to last through at least mid-week,\u201d the airline said in the statement. National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said investigators still have a lot of work to do to determine what led to Friday\u2019s \u201caccident.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve now determined, based on our definition of substantial damage, that it is an accident not an incident,\u201d Homendy said in a late Saturday night news conference. Investigators will be looking at several components, including the maintenance and repair records, she added. Homendy sought to assure travelers that air travel in the United States is safe. \u201cWe have the safest aviation system in the world. It is incredibly safe. We are the global gold standard for safety around the world,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cBut we have to maintain that standard.\u201d An extraordinary grounding Earlier Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered the temporary grounding of Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft, the model involved in an Alaska Airlines emergency landing in Oregon on Friday after a section of the plane apparently blew out in midflight. The FAA said the planes must be parked until emergency inspections are performed, which will \u201ctake around four to eight hours per aircraft.\u201d \u201cThe FAA is requiring immediate inspections of certain Boeing 737 Max 9 planes before they can return to flight,\u201d FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said Saturday in a statement. \u201cSafety will continue to drive our decision-making as we assist the (National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s) investigation into Alaska Airlines Flight 1282.\u201d The order impacts 171 Boeing 737 Max 9 jets, the agency approximates. Boeing said the company supported the FAA\u2019s grounding decision. \u201cSafety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers,\u201d Boeing said in a statement. \u201cWe agree with and fully support the FAA\u2019s decision to require immediate inspections of 737-9 airplanes with the same configuration as the affected airplane.\u201d United also said it has also suspended service on select Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft to conduct the FAA-required inspection. \u201cWe are working directly with impacted customers to find them alternative travel options,\u201d United said in a statement. \u201cRemoving certain Max 9 aircraft from service is expected to cause about 60 cancellations today.\u201d United, which has 79 Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft, said it\u2019s working \u201cworking with the FAA to clarify the inspection process and the requirements for returning all MAX 9 aircraft to service.\u201d What happened on Alaska flight 1282? Alaska Airlines flight 1282, which was headed from Portland to Ontario, California, returned safely to Portland International Airport around 5 p.m. PT after \u201cthe crew reported a pressurization issue,\u201d the FAA said. A panel of the fuselage, including the panel\u2019s window, popped off shortly after takeoff, passenger Kyle Rinker told CNN. \u201cIt was really abrupt. Just got to altitude, and the window/wall just popped off and didn\u2019t notice it until the oxygen masks came off,\u201d Rinker said. Firefighters were called to assess minor injuries after the landing, and no serious injuries were reported, the Port of Portland Fire Department said. Several guests onboard the plane required medical attention due to injuries, and all \u201chave now been medically cleared,\u201d Alaska Airlines said Saturday night\u2019s statement. The airline did not provide further details on the nature of the injuries. A passenger\u2019s video posted to social media shows a side section of the fuselage, where a window would have been, missing \u2013 exposing passengers to the outside air. The video, which appears to have been taken from several rows behind the incident, shows oxygen masks deployed throughout the airplane, and least two people sitting near and just behind the missing section. \u201cWe are very, very fortunate here that this didn\u2019t end up in something more tragic,\u201d Homendy said. No one was seated in seats 26A and 26B, where the piece blew off, and it happened before the plane reached cruise altitude, when passengers could have been unbuckled and walking around, Homendy said. Homendy said investigators are learning just how \u201cchaotic\u201d the scene was from individuals who have spoken to the flight crew. Missing headrests on seats 26A and 25A, as well as a missing back portion of 26A is just some of the damage Homendy described. In a statement late Friday, Alaska Airlines said it was working with Boeing to understand what took place on Flight 1282. The part of the aircraft involved was the \u201cplug door\u201d \u2013 a specific panel of the fuselage near the rear of the aircraft, Alaska said Saturday. A manufacturer can put a plug door in place of an emergency exit door, depending on the configuration requested by an airline. \u201cWhat you would see in the cabin if\u00a0you are a passenger is a window and just part of the cabin, you would not see those as doors,\u201d Homendy said Saturday.\u201d The aircraft is a 737 Max 9 that\u00a0received its certificate of airworthiness on October 25, 2023, according to the FAA. The airline said Saturday that it had received the aircraft on October 31. According to\u00a0FlightAware, the flight was airborne for about 20 minutes. The plane departed from Portland International Airport around 5:07 p.m. local time and landed at 5:27 p.m. The plane \u201clanded safely back at Portland International Airport with 171 guests and six crew members,\u201d the airline said Friday. \u201cMy heart goes out to those who were on this flight \u2013 I am so sorry for what you experienced,\u201d Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci said in a statement. The NTSB asked for the public\u2019s help finding the piece of the plane that blew off. \u201cWe believe, from looking at radar data, that the door is around Barnes Road near I-217 in the Cedar Hills neighborhood. If you find that please, please contact local law enforcement,\u201d Homendy said. \u2018A really loud bang\u2026 and a whoosh noise\u2019 Evan Smith, a passenger on the flight, told CNN affiliate KPTV that he was sitting at least six rows in front of the section where the incident took place. \u201cThere was a really loud bang toward the rear of the plane and a whoosh noise and all of the masks dropped,\u201d Smith said. Emma Vu, another passenger, was asleep and woke up to a sensation of falling and seeing emergency masks drop down, she told CNN in a phone call. She apparently woke up after the panel section popped off; it wasn\u2019t clear how close to the missing panel she was. Vu said she texted her parents their code word for emergencies to let them know about the incident. \u201cI\u2019ve never had to use it before, but I knew that this was that moment,\u201d Vu said. People sitting on either side of her comforted her, she said. \u201cThe flight attendant came over too, and told me it was going to be OK,\u201d Vu said.\u00a0\u201cThe fact that everyone was kind of freaking out and she took that time to kind of make me feel like I was the only passenger \u2013 honestly that was really sweet.\u201d Vu plans to take a different flight to her intended destination on Saturday morning, she said. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the incident, both agencies said. In a statement to CNN, Boeing said it was aware of an incident involving Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 and was working to gather additional information. Previous issues with Boeing\u2019s 737 Max jets CNN reported last month that Boeing has asked airlines to inspect all of their 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft. CNN transportation analyst Mary Schiavo said Saturday that issue probably had nothing to do with Friday\u2019s incident. But, overall, the issues raise serious questions about Boeing quality control in manufacturing that the FAA must investigate, Schiavo said. Boeing\u2019s engineering and quality problems have\u00a0posed major challenges\u00a0for the company. The crashes of two of 737-8 Max jets that\u00a0killed all 346 people\u00a0on board the flights led to a crippling\u00a020-month grounding\u00a0of the plane. It also was one of the most expensive corporate tragedies\u00a0in history, costing Boeing more than\u00a0$20 billion. The Max returned to the air carrying passengers in most markets around the globe beginning in\u00a0late December 2020. But it has encountered other problems, including in April when Boeing said it has discovered a manufacturing issue with some\u00a0737 Max aircraft\u00a0after a supplier used a \u201cnon-standard manufacturing process\u201d during the installation of two fittings in the rear fuselage \u2013 although Boeing insisted the problem did not constitute a safety risk.

            "text": "Some airlines have experienced delays this weekend after an Alaska Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing Friday when a panel and window blew out of the Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft. The incident has led to a federal investigation, and a number of airlines have grounded portions of their fleets for safety concerns. With snow battering parts of the northeast and more on the way, weather-related setbacks could also exacerbate air travel holdups. On Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to ground many of their Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes for inspection. The FAA said its directive will impact 171 planes around the world. Even though some of the affected airlines\u2019 fleets comprise hundreds of planes, temporary flight suspensions can still put strain on travelers as operators scramble to fill scheduling holes. Rescheduling depends on a variety of factors. Airlines with larger fleets will generally have an easier time shuffling aircraft around to meet customer demand. Airlines with smaller fleets and airlines relying more heavily on the affected planes could find it more difficult. Location can also play a role. Airports capable of supporting a larger number of aircraft are more likely to have spare planes to replace the grounded ones. Alaska Airlines temporarily grounded its MAX 9 fleet and said it was inspecting the plug doors on all its jets. The \u201cplug door\u201d refers to a portion of the plane\u2019s fuselage the manufacturer can put in place instead of an emergency exit door. As of Saturday evening, the airline said it has canceled 160 flights, \u201caffecting roughly 23,000 guests.\u201d While it is working with affected customers, the airline estimated \u201cthe disruption (will) last through at least mid-week.\u201d On Sunday, United Airlines said 180 of its 265 scheduled flights were canceled, but that it managed to save 85 flights by switching to different aircraft. United has 79 MAX 9 aircraft in its fleet, and all of them are being inspected to comply with the FAA. \u201cWe are working with customers to re-accommodate them on other flights,\u201d the company said in a statement. Turkish Airlines said it has five MAX 9 aircraft in its 440-plane fleet and told CNN it is conducting a \u201cprecautionary examination\u201d of these planes. \u201cUntil the technical investigation process is completed and the measures requested by the authorities are implemented, Turkish Airlines has decided to withdraw \u2026 MAX 9 aircraft in its fleet from operation at the first airport they land at,\u201d spokesperson Yahya Ustun said in a statement. Panama-based Copa Airlines said it has suspended the 21 MAX 9 planes according to the FAA\u2019s directive. \u201cCopa has initiated the necessary technical inspections and expects to return these aircraft safely and reliably to the flight schedule within the next 24 hours,\u201d the airline said Saturday in a statement. \u201cThe airline\u2019s team is working to minimize the impact on our passengers, although some delays and cancellations are expected due to this situation beyond the airline\u2019s control.\u201d Aviation trial attorney Robert Clifford told CNN this incident will have consequential reputational repercussions for Boeing and will likely be on the hook to pay airlines for lost revenue. \u201c(Boeing) has to stop giving lip service to the idea that they put safety over profits because right now it looks like they put \u2026 speed to the marketplace over safety,\u201d he said. \u201cThey put the need to have a competitive advantage against Airbus over safety.\u201d Boeing and Airbus together own more than 90% of the commercial plane market share. Boeing has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Clifford is the lead counsel for the pending civil litigation against Boeing for the 737 MAX 8 flight that crashed in Ethiopia in March 2019, killing all 157 people on board. That crash eventually led the FAA to ground all 737 MAX planes for 20 months, alongside dozens of other countries across the globe. While the cause of the MAX 8 crash was a software issue rather than the structural malfunction that led to the Alaska Airlines incident, according to Clifford this incident still raises important public safety questions. \u201cThis incident with the Max 9 should force the aviation community, particularly government regulators, to determine if allowing the Boeing Max 8 was allowed to fly again too hastily in Boeing\u2019s efforts to get those planes back in the air,\u201d he said, noting the repercussions were relatively minor because the plane was only 16,000 feet in the air. \u201cIf something like this happened at 30,000 feet, everyone would perish,\u201d he added. Clifford said the immediate action taken by the FAA and airlines to ground the flights means the operators and regulatory bodies are focusing on whether \u201cthere is a defect in the fleet of Boeing 737 Max 9 plug structures. The government clearly doesn\u2019t want to repeat the tragedy that occurred with the Max 8. The potential for further problems cannot be understated.\u201d",

            "text": "It happened in a moment: The Boeing 737 Max-9 was gaining altitude after taking off from Portland. Then a loud boom \u2013 an explosion \u2013 then a rush of air and screams as a refrigerator-sized hole was left in the side of the 220-passenger plane. A boy\u2019s shirt was ripped clean off his body, flying out the hole, amid the air pressure loss after a part of the plane\u2019s fuselage blew off. Some passengers screamed and cried, drafting text messages to their loved ones as a rush of air entered the plane and oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling. Nick Hoch, a 33-year-old passenger on the plane on Friday, called the ordeal \u201ctraumatic,\u201d \u201ctense,\u201d and \u201cjarring,\u201d in a phone interview with CNN. \u201cA mist or cloud whooshed past me that kind of hit me in the face,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople\u2019s hair was flying all over the place.\u201d After the initial \u201cboom,\u201d he said the plane \u201ckind of jolted.\u201d Oxygen masks fell, everyone put them on and he said he felt disoriented. \u201cI was pretty startled and frightened, and I think other folks were pretty distraught as well.\u201d Hoch said he was sitting on the left side of the plane a couple of rows in front of where the panel blew off.\u00a0\u201cThere were people much closer who I spoke with who lost AirPods out of their ears,\u201d he said. Soon after the portion of the plane blew off, Hoch said people were \u201cremarkably calm,\u201d as they sat quietly listening to the flight crew. Hoch told CNN the flight crew and pilot did a magnificent job. He said they were calming and reassuring.\u00a0\u201cThere were a few frantic passengers but mostly everybody was calm,\u201d he said. The flight had reached 16,000 feet after taking off from Portland, Oregon, bound for Ontario, California, about 5:07 p.m., according to\u00a0FlightAware. Shortly after takeoff, a panel, including a window, popped off, passenger Kyle Rinker told CNN. \u201cIt was really abrupt. Just got to altitude, and the window/wall just popped off.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d like to get down,\u201d the pilot told air traffic control, according to a recording posted on\u00a0liveatc.net. \u201cWe are declaring an emergency. We do need to come down to 10,000.\u201d The plane, with 171 passengers and six crew members on board, la\ufeffnded safely about 20 minutes later at the airport. One person was taken to a hospital. The airline said in a Saturday statement several guests on Flight 1282 were injured and required medical attention but have all since been medically cleared. Alaska Airlines temporarily grounded the rest of its Boeing 737-9 Max fleet and said it was inspecting the plug doors on all its jets. The \u201cplug door\u201d refers to a portion of the plane\u2019s fuselage the manufacturer can put in place instead of an emergency exit door, depending on the configuration requested by an airline. The Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday said it was grounding many aircraft of the model for inspections, affecting 171 jets used by airlines. Alaska Airlines said it inspected 18 of the Boeing 737 Max 9 in its fleet Saturday and returned those to service, but hours later, reversed course and said those aircraft would be removed \u201cuntil details about possible additional maintenance work are confirmed with the FAA.\u201d Passenger Emma Vu said passengers comforted each other during the ordeal. \u201cThe flight attendant came over, too, and told me it was going to be OK,\u201d Vu told CNN.\u00a0\u201cThe fact that everyone was kind of freaking out and she took that time to kind of make me feel like I was the only passenger \u2013 honestly that was really sweet.\u201d Passengers applauded as the plane landed, King\u2019s video shows. Some passengers stood up. Flight attendants reminded them to remain seated. One man can be heard saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a f**kin\u2019 hole inside the plane.

            "text": "Boeing faces scrutiny over the safety of its aircrafts after an Alaska Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing Friday when a panel and window blew out. Although it\u2019s unclear what or who was to blame for the incident, engineering and quality problems have plagued Boeing in recent years. The aircraft maker has seen a string of incidents that have resulted in tragedies, groundings and ongoing worries about safety. Perhaps the most notable incident, in 2019, all 737 Max planes were grounded across dozens of countries following crashes of two of of its jets \u2014 one in Ethiopia and one near Indonesia \u2014 that killed all 346 people on board. It was determined a design flaw in the plane was a major cause of the crashes. The US grounding lasted 20 months, with planes starting to return to service in December 2020. Other countries, including China, kept the planes on the ground even longer. The Max grounding was one of the most expensive corporate tragedies in history, costing the company more than $20 billion. And the costs are ongoing.\u00a0Boeing has faced massive operating losses in recent quarters as it tries to deliver the huge backlog of 737 Max planes to customers and racks up cost overruns on other planes, including the aircraft that will replace the current Air Force One jets. Boeing has encountered a slew of other problems in recent years and as recently as December when the FAA urged airlines to inspect all 737 Max planes in their fleets after the discovery of missing bolts in two planes\u2019 rudder control systems. In April, Boeing said it discovered a manufacturing issue with some 737 Max aircraft after a supplier used a \u201cnon-standard manufacturing process\u201d during the installation of two fittings in the rear fuselage \u2013 although Boeing insisted the problem did not constitute a safety risk. The Max has also faced numerous notices for additional inspections since it returned to service in 2020. Boeing says that\u2019s a result of its increased focus on safety. And problems have not been limited to the Max:\u00a0Boeing has faced massive operating losses in all but one quarter since 2019. It was forced to halt deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner widebody jet because of quality control problems. Though the Dreamliner was not grounded like the Max, it still hurt the company\u2019s bottom line. Throughout this, Boeing has racked up cost overruns on other planes, including losses of more than $2 billion on the two aircraft now being worked on that will replace the current Air Force One jets.",

            "text": "Gautam Adani has had a good start to 2024. After a tumultuous year, the Indian tycoon has just retaken his former position as Asia\u2019s richest man, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The founder of the sprawling Adani Group is now worth $97.6 billion, which makes him the 12th wealthiest person on the planet. The self-made industrialist and college dropout has gained more than $13 billion in net worth over the last two days, which has allowed him to overtake fellow countryman Mukesh Ambani as the continent\u2019s biggest billionaire, the tracker said. Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, is currently worth $97 billion. Adani\u2019s jump in wealth \u2014 the world\u2019s largest this year, according to the index \u2014 comes almost 12 months after his ports-to-power conglomerate was accused by the US short-seller Hindenburg Research of \u201cbrazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme.\u201d As a result of the scrutiny that followed those accusations, Adani\u2019s fortune, which in September 2022 was worth more than that of Jeff Bezos, saw a stunning fall. At one point, the businessman lost over $80 billion following\u00a0Hindenburg\u2019s release of the report in January 2023. His net worth recovered somewhat in the months that followed. At the end of last year, the Bloomberg index put his wealth at a healthy $84.3 billion, but that was still over 40% below the September 2022 level. In its investigation, which Hindenburg said took two years to compile, the American firm had questioned the \u201csky-high valuations\u201d of Adani companies and said their \u201csubstantial debt\u201d put the entire group \u201con a precarious financial footing.\u201d Short-sellers make money by betting that a company\u2019s stock will fall. The Adani Group published a 400-page rebuttal, calling the Hindenburg analysis \u201cnothing but a lie.\u201d But that did not prevent the stock market meltdown early last year, which hammered the conglomerate\u2019s market value and Adani\u2019s personal fortune. The country\u2019s market regulator also launched a probe into the group. But Adani stocks have rallied this week after India\u2019s top court ordered the regulator to wrap up its investigation quickly and said that no further probes into the group were needed. Adani welcomed the ruling, saying \u201ctruth has prevailed\u201d and that his \u201chumble contribution to India\u2019s growth story will continue.\u201d Shares in Adani Enterprises, his\u00a0flagship firm, have risen almost 7% this week. Seen as a close ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Adani has at times been\u00a0compared\u00a0to business magnates\u00a0such as John D. Rockefeller and Cornelius Vanderbilt, who built vast monopoly businesses in the 1800s during America\u2019s Gilded Age. He began his career with diamond trading, before setting up a commodity trading business in 1988, which later evolved into Adani Enterprises. He now has firms in key sectors ranging from ports and power to media and clean energy. Before the start of the Hindenburg saga, markets had relentlessly cheered for Adani, betting on his ability to grow his business in sectors that Modi has prioritized for development.",

The Department of Transportation released statistics for 2023 that show among the 16.3 million flights in the United States, there was a total cancellation rate below 1.2%, marking \u201cthe lowest rate in a decade,\u201d the agency said. The same figure for 2022 was 2.3%, the second-highest amount of cancellations in the past 10 years, according to DOT\u2019s numbers. 2014 had the highest cancellation rate in the past decade, at 2.4%. Holiday air travel over the past few weeks was also \u201cnotably smooth\u201d with just a cancellation rate of 0.8% between December 17, 2023 and January 1, 2024, DOT said, adding that it saw a \u201crecord number\u201d of passengers. That\u2019s a steep drop from the cancellation rate over a similar time period in 2022, when it was 8.2% because of a massive winter storm that snarled flyers\u2019 plans. \u201cThanks to the tireless work of our nation\u2019s aviation safety professionals, millions of travelers were able to fly safely and without disruption last year,\u201d said Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in a press release. Over the past year, airlines have bolstered hiring. Employment in the sector is now at its highest level in more than two decades as travel bounces back following the Covid-19 pandemic and global lockdowns. In May 2023, the Biden administration also announced a proposal for a new rule that would require mandating airlines to compensate and cover expenses for customers facing cancellations or delays. Despite the rosy figures, problems still plague US aviation, including an ongoing shortage of air traffic controllers and aging technology used by airlines.",

            "text": "Too often, headlines about airlines and airports focus on the bad \u2013 extensive delays, inclement weather, nightmare passengers and the like. So when there\u2019s a chance to celebrate something good in the aviation world, it requires a look. Aviation analytics company Cirium has crunched the numbers to reveal which airlines and airports around the world have the best on-time ratings. No matter where in the world you live \u2013 or are planning to go \u2013 these stats give some hope that your next trip can be smooth sailing. Flying high Although Cirium recognizes winners in different continents, the overall prize for Most Punctual Airline was won by Avianca, the Colombian flag carrier. Usually styled with a lowercase A at the beginning, it\u2019s part of the Star Alliance network. While Avianca got overall recognition, the airline nabbing the title of most punctual in South America was Copa, the national airline of Panama. The most on-time airline in Asia was Japan\u2019s All Nippon Airways (ANA). In North America it was Delta Air Lines, while Iberia Express won the title for Europe. The most punctual airline in the Middle East and Africa was Oman Air, which celebrated its 30th birthday in 2023. However, digging a bit deeper into the data shows a more diverse portrait of punctual planes. Cirium looked at several factors when compiling their rankings: on-time arrivals, tracked flights and total flights made. According to Cirium\u2019s analysis, Avianca had 85.73% on-time arrivals out of 213,039 total flights. Meanwhile, two US-based airlines \u2013 Delta and American Airlines \u2013 far outpaced the rest of the list in terms of flight totals. Delta had 1,635,486 flights take off in 2023, with an 84.72% on-time arrival rate; American was responsible for 1,998,844 flights with an 80.61% successful on-time arrival record. Also scoring highly were Qatar Airways (85.11%) and Japan Airlines (82.58%). For David White, senior director of advanced initiatives at Cirium, 2023 was a year of resilience for the airline industry after being battered by the pandemic. \u201cDespite the challenges, the leading airlines managed to finish the year with impressive on-time performance metrics,\u201d White said in a statement. Cirium also shouted out smaller, low-cost carriers. The top five were Safair (South Africa), Azul (Brazil), Hong Kong Express, JetStar Japan and Iberia Express (Spain). The full report also noted that not all delays are the fault of the airline itself. Weather, airport traffic and staffing issues can also be contributing factors. Airport awards According to Cirium, the best airport in the world for punctuality in 2023 was Minneapolis-St Paul (MSP) in Minnesota. The most punctual medium-sized airport was Osaka International (ITM) in Japan. However, that\u2019s not the primary air hub for Osaka, as most international visitors come via Kansai International Airport (KIX), about an hour outside the city. Osaka International, also called Itami, is a smaller airport that \u2013 despite its name \u2013 acts as a domestic hub in the country. Meanwhile, the winner in the small-airport category was Mariscal Sucre International Airport (UIO), which serves Quito, Ecuador.",

The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R.\u00a0Ford will head back to its homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, after its first combat deployment, an eight-month cruise that began on May 2, the statement said. The Ford \u2013 described by a Navy spokesperson as the \u201cmost adaptable and lethal combat platform in the world\u201d \u2013 was commissioned in 2017 and is the US Navy\u2019s newest aircraft carrier and the lead ship in the Navy\u2019s first new carrier class designed in over 40 years.

With the Ford\u2019s departure,\u00a0the USS Eisenhower\u00a0is the lone US aircraft carrier in the region as tensions increase over Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The Houthis have\u00a0launched dozens of attacks\u00a0on commercial vessels since October 7, saying they are acting in solidarity with Hamas amid the group\u2019s war with Israel.

US guided-missile destroyers, including some of\u00a0which have brought down Houthi drones and missiles\u00a0in recent weeks, are also in the region, Sixth Fleet said. In addition, the US has\u00a0begun Operation Prosperity Guardian, a maritime coalition aimed at beefing up security in the southern Red Sea. \u201cWe are collaborating with Allies and partners to bolster maritime security in the region.

            "text": "SpaceX\u2019s hulking Falcon Heavy rocket returned to the skies Thursday evening, and this time it launched a mysterious spacecraft for the US military that will carry out cutting-edge research. The rocket lifted off from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 8:07 p.m. ET, carrying the military\u2019s X-37B space plane \u2014 which is uncrewed and operates autonomously \u2014 to unprecedented altitudes. The launch streamed live on SpaceX\u2019s website. The side boosters returned to Earth and safely touched down. It is not clear, however, exactly where the space plane is going. The X-37B\u2019s activities in space have long been the subject of fascination and speculation in the space community as amateur enthusiasts race to track its whereabouts and share theories about its activities. Resembling a miniature NASA space shuttle with the windows blacked out, the reusable and fully autonomous X-37B has been known to carry out research on concepts such as relaying solar energy from space for use back on Earth and studying the effects of radiation on seeds used to grow food. And this mission \u2014 the seventh trip to space for an X-37B plane \u2014 promises to be even more intriguing than earlier flights. A powerful ride This launch marked the first time the space plane has hitched a ride on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy, one of the most powerful operational rockets in the world. Previously, the X-37B has launched on the SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle and the Atlas V rocket built by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The Falcon Heavy produces more thrust than both of those rockets combined. The launch via the Falcon Heavy could indicate that X-37B is destined for more distant orbits, perhaps even to the moon or Mars, suggested Paul Graziani, CEO of COMSPOC, a company dedicated to tracking objects in space. If it does travel much deeper into the cosmos than earlier flights, it could be far more difficult for sky-gazers on Earth to determine where the vehicle is. If the military doesn\u2019t want people to track the X-37B, Graziani added, the vehicle can be hidden in the glare of the sun or by various other means \u2014 including changing its position often. The X-37B has already proven on previous flights that it\u2019s capable of making multiple maneuvers in space. COMSPOC will attempt to search for the vehicle if the spacecraft winds up in geosynchronous orbit, which lies about 22,400 miles (36,000 kilometers) from Earth and is where most massive communications satellites operate. Geosynchronous orbit is where the company focuses its sensors for tracking satellites, said Graziani and Bob Hall, COMSPOC\u2019s director of operations integration. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the most interesting things that\u2019s happened in space in a long time, whatever it\u2019s going to do,\u201d Graziani said of the X-37B launch. Space technology innovations The X-37B makes it possible for the United States to carry out experiments to understand how to improve ongoing and upcoming space operations and push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible, according to a statement by Gen. B. Chance Saltzman, chief of space operations. Among the research on board this mission is a NASA experiment that aims to find ways to sustain astronauts on future deep-space missions. Called Seeds-2, it will \u201cexpose plant seeds to the harsh radiation environment of long-duration spaceflight\u201d and build on research carried out on previous X-37B missions. Learning how to grow food in the harsh, soilless environment of outer space could be crucial for astronauts on lengthy missions to the moon or beyond \u2014 places where it\u2019s more difficult to deliver fresh supplies. It\u2019s unclear how long the spacecraft will spend in orbit for this stint, though historically each X-37B flight has been longer than the last. The last trip to space for the autonomous X-37B concluded in November 2022 after the spacecraft logged nearly 909 consecutive days in space. During that sixth mission, as CNN previously reported, the space plane carried experimental technology designed by the US Navy to convert solar energy and transmit it back to the ground, according to the military. The X-37B has already spent more than 3,700 days in space on other uncrewed missions. When it returns to Earth, it will land on a runway, much like an airplane swooping down from the skies. Challenging China This launch came after more than two weeks of delays. SpaceX was prepared to lift off on December 10. The launch was pushed off twice because of weather and issues with the ground pad before SpaceX abruptly delayed the mission indefinitely to \u201cperform additional system checkouts.\u201d But during the downtime, China \u2014 which the US government considers its chief competitor in a modern space race \u2014 sent its own secretive spacecraft into orbit. Little about the spacecraft from China is known. Some in the industry speculate it is a doppelganger of the X-37B in form and function, though no official photos of the vehicle have been released. China\u2019s state-run Xinhua News Agency reported that the clandestine spacecraft launched aboard a Long March 2F rocket. The agency\u2019s post added only that during its stay in space, the vehicle will test out reusable space technology and carry out unspecified science experiments \u201cfor the peaceful use of space.\u201d It is not clear how long China\u2019s space plane will spend in orbit.",

            "text": "Boeing has asked airlines to inspect all of their 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft. An unnamed international airline found a bolt with a missing nut in a rudder-control linkage mechanism while conducting routine maintenance \u2013 and it found a similar bolt that wasn\u2019t properly tightened in a yet-to-be delivered plane. An airplane\u2019s rudder is used to control and stabilize the aircraft while in flight. Boeing said the plane with the missing bolt was fixed, but it wants to ensure all 1,370 737 Max planes in service worldwide are checked for similar problems. \u201cThe issue identified on the particular airplane has been remedied,\u201d a Boeing spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, we are recommending operators inspect their 737 Max airplanes and inform us of any findings.\u201d Boeing informed the Federal Aviation Administration, which said Thursday that the inspection involves looking for \u201ca possible loose bolt in the rudder control system.\u201d The task takes about two hours, according to the FAA, and airlines will report progress of their inspections to the regulator. Boeing said the repair involves removing an access panel and visually validating the nuts and bolts. Boeing will perform the inspection on all new aircraft going forward. The FAA said it would \u201cconsider additional action based on any further discovery of loose or missing hardware.\u201d The part in question is a critical safety item, for which the FAA requires double inspection. That means two sets of eyes must sign off that it is ready for flight. Boeing\u2019s engineering and quality problems have posed major challenges for the company. The crashes of two of 737 Max jets that\u00a0killed all 346 people\u00a0on board the flights led to a crippling\u00a020-month grounding\u00a0of the plane. It also was one of the most expensive corporate tragedies in history, costing Boeing more than $20 billion. The Max returned to the air carrying passengers in most markets around the globe beginning in late December 2020. But it has encountered other problems, including in April when Boeing said it has discovered a manufacturing issue with some\u00a0737 Max aircraft after a supplier used a \u201cnon-standard manufacturing process\u201d during the installation of two fittings in the rear fuselage \u2013 although Boeing insisted the problem did not constitute a safety risk. The Max has faced numerous notices for additional inspections since it returned to service. Boeing says that\u2019s a result of its increased focus on safety, but a missing nut on a crucial system cannot be explained away, noted CNN safety analyst David Soucie. \u201cIf the airplane left the factory with this missing part, it indicates the past three years of safety culture improvements and improved inspections on critical safety of flight systems at Boeing isn\u2019t working,\u201d Soucie said. Boeing has faced problems, delays and financial charges for just about all of its other passenger jets too: The FAA flagged quality problems with the company\u2019s 787 Dreamliners, leading Boeing to temporarily halt deliveries last year. Though the Dreamliner was not grounded like the Max, it still hurt the company\u2019s bottom line. Boeing has faced massive operating losses in recent quarters as it tries to deliver the huge backlog of 737 Max planes to customers and racks up cost overruns on other planes, including the aircraft that will replace the current Air Force One jets.",

            "text": "Passengers will fly in 2024 with airlines that are putting their post-lockdown plans into place. And that includes shiny new airplanes containing new seat designs arriving at a rapid pace. A scattering of new airports and terminals will change the game in a few key regions, although some routes and airplanes will be delayed into 2025 or further because of supply chain difficulties. Let\u2019s start with those new airports and terminals before taking a look at the airplane deliveries and new seats. A big new terminal and a major airport upgrade Abu Dhabi International Airport, home to Etihad Airways, fully opened its Terminal A in late 2023 after much delay. This enormous facility is a huge improvement and will allow Etihad to offer much improved connections, a much more pleasant space for passengers and new lounges as the carrier expands into 2024. Meanwhile, at Los Angeles\u2019 LAX, the biggest news is outside the terminals \u2014\u00a0sort of. The Automated People Mover train system at the airport has taken five years to complete with six stations, connecting the terminals with the new rental car facility, ride-hailing zones, parking lots and the new Metro Transit Center station for the local C and K Metro Rail lines. It\u2019s a massive improvement and will hopefully go a long way toward reducing the airport\u2019s traffic snarls when it opens in 2024. Across the world, expect to see a number of quality-of-life improvements to airports rolling out, such as more of the new bag scanners that mean you don\u2019t have to take liquids or electronics out in security lines and more integrated airline and airport apps that reduce queueing times and speed up boarding. New small planes will make a big difference onboard The big news is in little planes \u2014 well, not that little. The Airbus A321XLR is the longest-range version of Airbus\u2019 A320neo family of single-aisle planes, with XLR standing for \u201cextra long range\u201d of 4,700 nautical miles or roughly nine to 10 hours of flying. After some delays, it\u2019s expected to start flying in late 2024. You might be familiar with the A320neo from shorter flights of a few hours, but the XLR version can fly as far as a much bigger plane \u2013 and more economically for airlines. Its extra long range opens up a lot of routes known as \u201clong and thin\u201d: the ones with too little passenger demand for a big plane, but too far for previous versions of the small planes to fly. \u201cIf everything goes well, I think this will really change the city pairs that would be served, and it could bring additional frequency to existing routes, so I think this aircraft will bring a lot of convenience,\u201d said Flavien T\u00eate, co-founder and chief executive officer of the popular flight review website Flight-Report.com. The relatively small plane compared with big widebodies \u201calso means shorter boarding and deboarding times,\u201d T\u00eate told CNN Travel, \u201cand also new cabins. The narrow-body cabin was not necessarily designed for full flat seats or premium economy seats, and these were not really optimized for the [previous] narrow-body fleet. So with the A321XLR, we\u2019re really going to see brand new seats, brand new ambience \u2014\u00a0we\u2019ll feel very cozy.\u201d Onboard the A321XLR, the big news will be in business class, where you\u2019ll find big new suites with doors, along the lines of what JetBlue has done with its Airbus A321LR (\u201clong range\u201d) in starting flights to Europe. New suites such as Stelia\u2019s Opera and Safran\u2019s Vue will arrive, leapfrogging older business class seats in comfort terms. In economy, expect the same kind of fully featured seats with big entertainment screens, power sockets and inflight WiFi options that you\u2019re used to on long flights. Newer seats such as the Recaro CL3810 also sculpt away some of the support structures at knee and shin level to give you a bit of extra legroom. In Australia, Qantas will take its first A321XLRs in 2024, and the airline is already starting to take its first Airbus A220 airplanes, replacing elderly Boeing 717s and adding space and features to its regional experience. A flock of new big planes mean new seats and services As airlines accelerate away from the pandemic downturn, the new planes they ordered are starting to arrive, featuring new cabins and new seats. Japan Airlines will start operating its first Airbus A350-1000 in January 2024, initially to New York and later in the spring to Dallas-Fort Worth as well. With luxurious first class suites, big business suites, upmarket premium economy and some of the most spacious economy seats in the sky, this is an airplane to watch out for. Watch out \u2014\u00a0or listen out \u2014\u00a0also for the new headrest speakers in first and business class seats, launched on these JAL A350s. This is Safran\u2019s Euphony system, which adjusts automatically to account for cabin noise so that whatever you\u2019re listening to isn\u2019t audible outside your own suite. It\u2019s not meant for swelling orchestral or cinematic masterpieces, but it\u2019s superb for falling asleep to a documentary or podcast without a big headset (or losing a Bluetooth earbud down the side of your seat). Lufthansa, meanwhile, is due to introduce its Allegris generation of products, with new seats in first, business, premium and economy, bringing its onboard experience up to date. Production delays, however, mean there may be some extra time to wait for the experience. Air India is also getting the first A350s that it designed itself, fresh from its rebrand with lovely new airplane paint jobs and superb new uniforms from fashion designer Manish Malhotra. While the airline has been taking a few A350s previously intended for Russia\u2019s Aeroflot in late 2023, these will be the first all-Air-India-designed cabins, with new seats throughout. Emirates, too, gets its first A350 in mid-2024, which will have new seats that have yet to be unveiled. The Dubai-based airline is also planning on replacing seats on its older Boeing 777 airplanes with a new business class product \u2014 not a moment too soon given the age of the seats on these aircraft. American Airlines adds to the list of new seats, for both smaller narrow-body and larger wide-body airplanes. More widely, Airbus will be ramping up\u00a0deliveries of its \u201cNPS\u201d or \u201cNew Production Standard\u201d A350s, which offer a slightly updated cabin. For passengers, this means thinner side walls and more space for galley kitchens, meal storage, lavatories and crew areas at the front and back of the plane. For airlines that keep their current 3-3-3 seat layout, this is good news for passengers: the 4-inch-wider cabins mean a little more shoulder room. But some airlines, reportedly including Etihad based in Abu Dhabi, are adding in a 10th seat to every economy row. But it\u2019s not all bad news for economy: Air New Zealand will launch its Skynest bunks in 2024 on flights to New York and Chicago, with six pods that let passengers grab some much-needed shut-eye. The airline expects to charge between $400 to $600 for a four-hour snooze. In economy, aircraft cabin designer Daniel Baron, the managing director of Lift Aero Design in Tokyo, tells CNN that \u201cthe post-Covid era is an overflowing river of complaints about the customer experience, reflecting frustration with eternal lines at airports, mishandled baggage, packed lounges, fees for things that used to be free, and compact living space in always-full economy class.\u201d \u201cAs a strategy to help mitigate the pain points,\u201d Baron predicts, \u201cairlines will be investing more in the back of the bus, with greater seat comfort, snazzier aesthetics and free connectivity. The creature features include better seat cushions and brighter colors, plus snack counters and mood lighting. It is very important for airlines to deliver tangible, relevant enhancements that keep people interested in flying.\u201d All of these new planes mean that airlines can choose to replace their older fleets or expand to new destinations. Keep an eye out as schedules are announced, especially for intercontinental flights \u2014 the transatlantic and transpacific routes are seeing a lot of new nonstop services pop up, which may be much more convenient.",

            "text": "What a difference one year can make \u2013 as many people who traveled by air during the now-notorious last week of 2022 could tell you. But at the tail end of 2023, you\u2019d mostly hear tales of improvement. As the days between Christmas and New Year\u2019s tick off, airlines are continuing their streak of few flight cancelations after last year\u2019s disastrous holiday travel meltdown. Figures from FlightAware show that US carriers have canceled less than 1% of all flights over the past week. Airlines scheduled more than 162,000 flights from December 20 to 26 and canceled just 1,100 of them. The FAA has warned that ground stops could go into place Wednesday for flights departing for major East coast airports in Philadelphia, Boston, New York and Washington as pilots and air traffic controllers battle low cloud ceilings and reduced visibility. But as of 3 p.m. ET, those ground stops have yet to materialize. Airlines have canceled only 129 flights in the United States and delayed another 3,800, according to FlightAware. The scene is diametrically opposed to Southwest Airlines\u2019 schedule meltdown over the last 10 days of 2022, which caused the cancelation of 16,900 flights and left two million passengers stranded. Even still, Southwest Airlines has delayed the most flights of any US carrier during the holiday rush \u2014 roughly one in four flights over the last week. From December 20 to 26, Southwest delayed 27% of its schedule, or 8,096 flights. Only 2% of Southwest flights have been canceled over the same period. Southwest delayed another 985 flights \u2014 or one in five flights scheduled \u2014 on Wednesday. Delays over the last week peaked on Tuesday, when US airlines delayed nearly 28% of all flights which arrived an average of 52 minutes late, according to FlightAware figures. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between a delay and a cancellation,\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said last week during a news conference. Buttigieg stressed the rate of flight cancelations are what he considers \u201chealthy,\u201d but \u201cthat does invite us to pay more attention to the issue of delays and to press the airlines on how they\u2019re behaving.\u201d American Airlines said late Tuesday that a handful of its regional flights have been canceled because of weather, boasting that it \u201ccontinues to have the fewest cancellations among major carriers this holiday period.\u201d",

            "title": "Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella is CNN Business\u2019 CEO of the Year",
            "text": "It was the year of artificial intelligence, and no Big Tech company leaned into the trend like Microsoft. In 2023, the company\u2019s CEO Satya Nadella made a multi-billion dollar investment in AI, commercialized and added AI tools like ChatGPT into its suite of products before rivals, and stunned industry onlookers with his ability to handle a crisis quickly, calmly and thoughtfully. Under his leadership, the company is re-emerging as a tech innovator after years of riding the success of Windows. Wall Street has noticed, too: Microsoft\u2019s stock is up 55% this year. That\u2019s why CNN Business\u2019 staff chose Nadella as the CEO of the Year, beating out other contenders including Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. \u201cThere\u2019s no question 2023 was the year of AI,\u201d Nadella told CNN in an emailed response. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer just talking about innovation in the abstract; we\u2019re seeing real product-making, deployment and productivity gains. At the end of the day, though, this innovation will only be useful if it\u2019s empowering all of us in our careers, in our communities, in our countries.\u201d Since 2018, the CNN Business\u2019 team of writers and editors have met at the end of each year to select one person whose executive performance stood out. The process is admittedly subjective \u2014 we choose someone based on criteria that shifts year to year. Maybe the company\u2019s stock outperformed its rivals. Maybe the CEO righted the ship after a messy product launch or the company developed a lifesaving vaccine that altered the course of human history (tip of that hat to 2021\u2019s CEO of the Year, Pfizer\u2019s Albert Bourla). This year\u2019s CEO of the Year is once again a man, indicative of a larger representative problem in corporate America\u2019s top positions. About 10% of CEOs at Fortune 500 companies are women, according to Fortune. But our aim has never been to endorse any one executive over another. Rather, we hold a mirror up to the business world and tell a story about what we see. (We also considered non-CEO leaders, and chose Taylor Swift as our business leader of the year.) For 2023, Nadella\u2019s decisions have heavily impacted and influenced the direction of AI, the most significant innovation to come from Silicon Valley in decades. As Gil Luria, a senior research analyst at wealth management firm DA Davidson, puts it: \u201cHis ability to steer the aircraft carrier that is Microsoft into this new era has been nothing short of remarkable.\u201d Changing the narrative Nadella\u2019s background doesn\u2019t entirely fit the Ivy League dropout archetype of Silicon Valley. Born in India, Nadella came to the US in the late 1980s to pursue a master\u2019s in computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, later receiving an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Nadella\u2019s standout performance is a culmination of his work from prior years. He joined the company in 1992 as an engineer, at a time Microsoft was characterized by regulators as a monopoly. When he was promoted to CEO nearly 10 years ago, Microsoft had developed a reputation for being slow to adapt to major trends, such as mobile. Fast forward to now and tech companies are lining up to partner with Microsoft and align with its mission to commercialize artificial intelligence for the masses. In Nadella\u2019s 2017 book, \u201cHit Refresh: The Quest to Rediscover Microsoft\u2019s Soul and Imagine a Better Future for Everyone,\u201d he wrote about his experience reworking everything internally, team by team and product by product, so Microsoft would be better set up for employees to collaborate with others. He also worked to soften and revitalize Microsoft\u2019s image. As far back as 2016, the company partnered with OpenAI \u2014 a then-emerging company with new AI tools \u2014 and allowed them to operate the technology on its Azure cloud servers in exchange for access to those tools. But after a massive $13 billion investment in OpenAI earlier this year, following the viral launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Microsoft rolled out AI-powered versions of its flagship products, such as Word, PowerPoint and Excel, breathing new life into otherwise dulled software. Nadella\u2019s push to commercialize these tools quickly gave it a head start against competitors such as Google and Amazon, who were working on similar technologies, and helped ignite an arms race across the industry. Now as more companies, from Instacart to Snapchat, add ChatGPT and other OpenAI technologies to their own services, Microsoft\u2019s cloud business is poised for deeper growth. Microsoft has reported strong Azure growth over the last three quarters.  Nadella\u2019s remarkable moment While Nadella had an impressive year across the board, his leadership shined even brighter during the string of events that followed the surprising ousting of OpenAI\u2019s Altman, the Friday afternoon before Thanksgiving week. The timing was noteworthy too: Just four days before, Nadella joined Altman on stage at OpenAI\u2019s first developer conference to discuss the future of artificial intelligence and their partnership together. The executives represented one of the most dynamic and key relationships in the tech industry, not only of the year but in years: Altman had clearly emerged as the face of the generative AI movement, and Nadella was one of the most powerful tech leaders funding the development of these tools. \u201cYou guys have built something magical,\u201d said Nadella at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s been fantastic for us.\u201d But despite his long-standing relationship with OpenAI, Nadella reportedly found out about Altman\u2019s removal from the company \u201cjust before\u201d OpenAI released a statement, rendering Microsoft with no control over the situation. The company in a statement said an internal investigation found that Altman was not always truthful with the board. Microsoft\u2019s stock sank in response, perhaps because OpenAI was to serve as a linchpin to their plans to expand AI across its products.\u00a0\u201cIt was not a good look for Microsoft,\u201d Luria said. Nadella swiftly picked up the phone and offered to hire Altman at Microsoft to lead a new AI research lab, along with one of the co-founders, Greg Brockman, and any of the 700 Open AI employees who wanted to leave the company. He also spoke to some OpenAI board members \u2014 the people who initially kept him out of the loop \u2014 and was able to get them on board with a solution that would be favorable to Microsoft, according to Luria. Altman ultimately returned to OpenAI, with a new board intact. \u201cHe turned what looked like a bad and embarrassing situation into a way to improve Microsoft\u2019s standing with this very important partner,\u201d Luria added. \u201cWhat we saw from Mr. Nadella is an interpersonal skill you don\u2019t always find with CEOs, who can be visionaries and luminaries and great at product, but aren\u2019t necessarily able to pick up a phone, talk to people and get them to see things your way.\u201d As Fred Havemeyer, a senior enterprise software analyst at the Macquarie financial services firm, said in a letter to investors, \u201cMr. Nadella may have pulled off his own coup, acquiring the most important part of OpenAI \u2014 its ambitious talent.\u201d By Monday morning, Microsoft was in better shape than they were a week before. Its stock reached a record that day; shares rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44, beating the previous record of $376.17. What\u2019s ahead According to Stuart Carlaw, chief research officer at ABI Research, Nadella\u2019s successful year can be largely attributed to the fact that he\u2019s remained extremely \u201cfocused.\u201d \u201cHis approach to the mechanics of leadership remains people driven,\u201d Carlaw said. \u201cHe understands that people drive outcomes, and remained true to that ethic in the way he dealt with Sam Altman and the wider OpenAI team.\u201d Nadella also narrows in on where he wants to spend his energy. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been on a scattergun spree of investment ever since he took the reins,\u201d Carlaw said. \u201cHe has been very focused on accretive areas that take the Microsoft brand forward.\u201d Takeshi Numoto, Microsoft\u2019s chief marketing officer who has been employed in various roles at the company for 25 years, said he felt an internal culture shift this year, saying the company feels \u201cfresh\u201d and \u201cenergizing.\u201d \u201cThere is a sense that we are contributing to building the next wave of computing broadly for the world, and doing so thoughtfully,\u201d he said. Nadella told CNN he indeed remains \u201cfocused\u201d on empowering both people and organizations to achieve more, as it continues to make and deploy new products. \u201cThat\u2019s our mission at Microsoft \u2026 and what we continue to focus on as we look to 2024 and beyond,\u201d he said. \u201cJust imagine if 8 billion people had access to a personalized tutor, a doctor that provided them medical guidance, a mentor that gave advice for anything they needed. I believe all that\u2019s within reach. It\u2019s about making the impossible possible.\u201d The biggest challenge, however, is if Nadella can take Microsoft to the next level by making these AI-powered products profitable. \u201cYou are only as good as your last results release,\u201d Carlaw said. \u201c[But] he is not the only one facing this dilemma.\u201d \u2014CNN\u2019s Allison Morrow contributed to this report.",

Lasting approximately 12 minutes in total, the flight departed from Hollister Airport, in Northern California, and was operated by Reliable Robotics, which has been working since 2019 on a semi-automated flying system in which the aircraft is controlled remotely by a pilot. The company recently announced that the 50-mile flight took place in November. The plane was a Cessna Caravan, a robust single-engine aircraft that is a popular choice for flight training, tourism, humanitarian missions and regional cargo. \u201cCessna has made 3,000 Caravans \u2014 it\u2019s the most popular cargo plane you\u2019ve never heard of,\u201d says Robert Rose, CEO of Reliable Robotics. \u201cPilots will tell you it\u2019s the workhorse of the industry. \u201cBut the challenge with this aircraft is that it flies at lower altitudes and more adverse weather conditions than many large aircraft do today. So operating it is much more dangerous, and automation is going to go a long way to improve the safety of these operations.\u201d Consultancy firm AviationValues told CNN there are currently 900 Caravans in active service, and FedEx \u2014 which has been using the type since 1985 \u2014 is the largest operator with about 200 of them. Reliable Robotics is now working with the Federal Aviation Administration to certify its technology for commercial operations, and expects that process to be complete in as little as two years. Not a video game The remote operator \u2014 a real pilot who must be certified to fly the aircraft exactly as if they were sitting in the cockpit \u2014 sends commands to the plane via encrypted satellite signals, but does not pilot the aircraft in real time nor gets any visual feed from the plane itself. The interface they use is closer to those used by air traffic controllers than drone pilots. \u201cThis is not a video game,\u201d says Rose. \u201cThere\u2019s no joystick and you don\u2019t have the ability to hand-fly the plane remotely. There\u2019s no video feed that gives you real-time feedback. The way they control the aircraft is essentially a menu of options: you can think of it like a \u2018choose your own adventure\u2019 based on where the aircraft is, and there\u2019s a set of buttons to allow the pilot to redirect the plane somewhere else.\u201d Each command sent to the plane includes all instructions required to land, so the aircraft always knows what to do even if communications are lost. \u201cYou could say that the aircraft is autonomous,\u201d Rose explains. \u201cIf you tell it to do nothing else, or if you lose communications with it, it\u2019s going to do the last thing you told it to do, which is the definition of autonomy. It has no direct human control.\u201d Compared to a traditional autopilot, the Reliable Robotics system is able to perform all phases of a flight, including moving out of the gate and towards the runway, as well as taking off and landing. But as far as other aircraft or air traffic controllers are concerned, this is just like any other plane, Rose says, because the remote operator will respond to radio calls and handle voice communications in such a way that it\u2019s impossible to tell they\u2019re not aboard. What if something goes wrong? According to Rose, there\u2019s at least one advantage in handling emergencies remotely: if a pilot loses control of the plane, they can immediately inform air traffic control of its position and last command. \u201cIn many ways this is better than the way aircraft operate today, because if you\u2019re flying around in the sky and you lose radio communications, or something goes wrong with the plane, you have to do something and air traffic control has no idea what you\u2019re going to do. So they have to clear the airspace all around you because nobody knows what your intentions are.\u201d Larger planes Once the system becomes commercially available, other security measures will come into effect, including a smart card that will be required to operate any aircraft. In addition, pilots will work from a control center where other people will be watching over them. For now, Reliable Robotics is looking to certify the system for the Caravan, but is already testing it on a larger aircraft with the US Air Force \u2014 the KC-135 Stratotanker, a military refueling plane based on the old Boeing 707 \u2014 and hopes to start testing on jet cargo aircraft within five to 10 years. According to Rose, remotely controlled regional cargo planes would have positive effects on both safety and the ongoing pilot shortage. \u201cThe pilot shortage is putting pressure on smaller aircraft operations, because the larger planes are sucking up all the pilots, and it\u2019s becoming much more difficult to sustain operations with smaller aircraft fleets. \u201cWe see remote piloting as a way to solve that problem in the near future.\u201d He adds that airlines will be able to streamline their operations because layovers will no longer be required, as pilots will be able to work from a single location. As for safety, Rose says that the system will prevent common types of accidents that are linked to human error, such as \u201cunintentional collisions with terrain\u201d and loss of control in flight, which account for the majority of fatal crashes. Rose explains that the Reliable Robotics system has been designed to prevent them, for example by cross-checking against a terrain and obstacle database in case the plane is erroneously programmed to fly into something. \u201cSignificant milestone\u201d The history of pilotless aircraft goes back to the early years of aviation, with the first examples of unmanned planes developed in the US and Britain during World War I. Most unmanned aerial vehicles today are categorized as drones, performing a range of functions from military action to search and rescue and photography. Merlin Labs and XWing, both in the US, and Volant in the UK, are among the companies developing similar systems to Reliable Robotics, with a similar attention to the cargo sector. In recent years, the concept of pilotless air taxis has also gained interest, with a first historic flight performed by German company Volocopter in Dubai in 2017; the Emirate is now planning to inaugurate its first \u201cvertiport\u201d for flying taxis within three years, albeit using vehicles manned by human pilots. In China, urban air mobility company EHang was the first to obtain, in October, full certification from the local authorities to fly a pilotless passenger-carrying UAV \u2014 the result of over 40,000 test flights. According to Jack W. Langelaan, a professor of Aerospace Engineering at Penn State University, who\u2019s not involved with Reliable Robotics, the company has achieved a significant milestone by completing a flight from hangar to hangar without an on-board pilot. \u201cThere are lots of hard things in robotic aircraft,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cTwo of them are dealing with the unexpected and fitting into the existing air traffic control system. The unexpected includes things like mechanical and sensor failures. \u201cWe can\u2019t anticipate everything and we need to prove that the robotic \u2018pilot\u2019 is at least as competent as a good human pilot. Fitting into the air traffic control system is also tricky: at the moment it\u2019s managed by humans talking to each other by radio, so Reliable used a remote pilot to manage this aspect of the flight. And of course, the human remote pilot was also ready to step in to deal with the unexpected.\u201d Gary Crichlow, head of commercial analysts at consultancy firm AviationValues, agrees that the technology to enable uncrewed operations is impressive. \u201cThat being said, the jump between crewed operations and uncrewed operations on a global scale is an extremely large one,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the technology, it\u2019s also about the economics and politics of replacing a highly skilled group of people with that technology. If anything, I\u2019d expect those barriers to be even more difficult to overcome than the technological hurdles.\u201d",

            "text": "Alibaba has reshuffled its top ranks after the stellar performance of a competitor caused a stir at the tech giant. Eddie Wu, Alibaba Group CEO, will now also head the firm\u2019s e-commerce business, replacing Trudy Dai, who has been with the company for over two decades, according to an internal letter from Joe Tsai, chairman of Alibaba Group, which was seen by CNN. Dai, who is one of Alibaba\u2019s 18 co-founders, will be setting up an asset management company for the group, the letter said. Shares in Alibaba (BABA) were up over 3% in Hong Kong on Wednesday. The shakeup comes weeks after billionaire co-founder Jack Ma called for \u201cchange\u201d at the company, as the dramatic success of rival PDD (PDD), the group behind\u00a0Chinese online shopping giant Pinduoduo\u00a0and\u00a0US-based retail upstart Temu, rattled China\u2019s e-commerce industry. PDD\u2019s stock has skyrocketed 77% so far this year, allowing it\u00a0to surpass\u00a0Alibaba in market capitalization for the first time last month. The surprise management change comes just three months after Wu replaced Daniel Zhang to become Alibaba Group\u2019s fourth CEO in its 24-year history. He also took over as head of the cloud division after Zhang\u2019s\u00a0surprise exit\u00a0from the unit. \u201cEddie has \u2026 navigated tough trade-offs and made difficult but necessary decisions,\u201d Tsai said in his letter. \u201cEddie\u2019s leadership of both Alibaba Cloud and TTG will ensure total focus on, and significant and sustained investment in, our two core businesses of cloud computing and e-commerce, as well as enabling TTG to transform through technology innovation.\u201d TTG refers to the Taobao and Tmall Group, which includes Alibaba\u2019s online shopping platforms. Alibaba\u2019s shares have tumbled 18% so far this year as it battles concerns over a sweeping restructuring, a\u00a0leadership shuffle\u00a0and fierce competition. Last month, Ma urged employees to \u201cpay any price and sacrifice\u201d to help reform the company after PDD\u2019s performance caused nervousness. PDD, which was founded in 2015, has enjoyed a bumper year. It has also attracted international attention for its launch of Temu, an affordable online superstore that has become\u00a0hugely popular\u00a0in markets such as the United States and Australia. Temu sells everything from home goods to apparel and electronics.",

            "text": "US Steel was once the pride and joy of the United States and the most valuable company in the entire world. The 122-year-old company has agreed to be bought by Japanese firm Nippon Steel in a $14.1 billion deal. But this isn\u2019t the first instance of an international company snapping up a classic American brand. \u201cAll-American\u201d companies like Jeep and Budweiser have some international flair, as do many other classic US brands. Here are some of the most notable examples: GE appliances Perhaps no company better embodies America\u2019s trailblazing spirit than General Electric. The company was founded by legendary American inventor Thomas Edison. But Americans with a GE microwave or washing machine in their homes may not realize that General Electric\u2019s century-old appliance division is owned by Haier Group, based in Qingdao, China. Haier bought the division from General Electric for $5.6 billion in 2016, as General Electric\u2019s business stalled and it looked to raise cash to chip away at a mountain of debt. Haier is itself a major appliance seller in the United States, with its own products offered at US stores such as Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s. Budweiser Budweiser\u2019s red and white cans and Bud Light\u2019s blue cans are instantly recognizable to many Americans. Budweiser\u2019s brewer, named Anheuser-Busch after the company\u2019s founders, was created in the United States in 1879 and helped pioneer pasteurization technology that allowed beers to be shipped across the country without spoiling, according to its website. But Budweiser\u2019s parent company was acquired by European alcohol conglomerate InBev in 2008, forming a new company: AB InBev, based in Leuven, Belgium. AB InBev also owns other well-known beer brands like Corona and Stella Artois. Burger King The current home of the Whopper is Toronto, Canada \u2014 kind of. The seminal fast food chain, founded in Miami in 1954, has been part of Canadian conglomerate Restaurant Brands International for nearly a decade. RBI was formed in 2014 with a $12.5 billion merger between Burger King and Canada-based coffeehouse Tim Hortons. While RBI\u2019s headquarters is in Toronto, Burger King\u2019s functional headquarters remains in Miami. Since RBI\u2019s creation, it has snapped up two more popular food brands: Popeye\u2019s Louisiana Kitchen and Firehouse Subs. 7-Eleven With its classic Slurpee and Big Gulp beverages, 7-Eleven is one of America\u2019s most recognizable convenience store chains. More than 13,000 7-Eleven stores operate in the US, making it one of the largest convenience store chains in the country. But there are even more 7-Eleven stores in Japan, according to the company. That\u2019s because the corner store, founded in 1927 in Texas, is owned by Seven & I Holdings, a Japanese retailer based in Tokyo. Seven & I officially became the sole owner of 7-Eleven in 2005, after Ito-Yokado, a unit of Seven & I, first bought a stake in the convenience store in 1991. Trader Joe\u2019s California-based Trader Joe\u2019s brands itself as a \u201cnational chain of neighborhood grocery stores.\u201d But the grocery chain known for its private label goods and competitive prices is owned by the same German family that founded another well-known grocery store: Aldi. Aldi, which was founded by brothers Karl and Theo Albrecht in 1946, was cleaved in half in the 1960s. One half of the Albrecht family owns Aldi Nord, while the other half owns Aldi Sud. Trader Joe\u2019s has been under Aldi Nord\u2019s ownership since 1979, while Aldi-branded grocery stores in the US are owned by Aldi Sud, meaning the two chains have no business relationship. Jeep, Chrysler and Dodge cars The Jeep Wrangler was first introduced at the 1986 Chicago Auto Show, but its roots date back to World War II, when the US Army used an earlier version as a reconnaissance vehicle around battlefields, according to Jeep. The famed model, with its rugged design and off-road capabilities, has had enduring appeal in America. But Jeep and its siblings Chrysler and Dodge have belonged to European companies since 2014, when Italian company Fiat Group acquired 100% ownership of Chrysler Group. In 2021, Fiat Chrysler Automotive Group, as it was then called, merged with French manufacturer PSA Group, creating Stellantis. The Amsterdam-based auto giant is now the fourth-largest automaker in the world by volume and part of the Detroit \u201cBig Three\u201d automakers in the US. Frigidaire Refrigerator appliance company Frigidaire is responsible for a lot of firsts in America: According to the company, it is the inventor of the first self-contained refrigerator and the first-ever home freezer, which it originally called the \u201cice cream cabinet.\u201d Frigidaire joins GE Appliances as a brand once owned by General Electric. The refrigerator maker was part of the Edison-founded conglomerate from 1919 to 1979. After brief ownership by White Consolidated Industries, Frigidaire was bought by Swedish multinational home appliance manufacturer Electrolux AB in 1986 \u2014 and it has remained in its ownership ever since. Ben & Jerry\u2019s Ben & Jerry\u2019s is best known for its quirky ice cream flavors with pun-filled names like \u201cCherry Garcia\u201d and \u201cPhish Food.\u201d The ice cream company, which was founded in 1978 by school friends Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield in a converted Vermont gas station, was acquired by British conglomerate Unilever in 2000. That means the sweet treat shares a home with consumer goods like Axe Body Spray and Vaseline. One company that is American\u2026 While many brands with international owners may seek to highlight their American roots, at least one of Ben & Jerry\u2019s competitors decided on a different route. H\u00e4agen-Dazs was cooked up by Polish immigrants Reuben and Rose Mattus in 1960 in the Bronx, New York. The couple invented a made-up Danish-sounding name for the brand, likely adding an air of mystery to the ice cream makers\u2019 origins in the decades since.",

            "text": "Travel rewards for free flights comes in all types. There are first-class flights to Asia, premium economy seats to Europe and even quick jaunts to your neighboring state. But some of the best value you can get for your miles can be found from short-haul flights. Saving on short-haul flights using travel rewards is especially true if you\u2019re traveling at the last minute. With American Airlines, in particular, that\u2019s possible by using British Airways miles, which are called Avios. Because British Airways and American Airlines are partners, you can use your Avios for nearly free American flights. Better yet, it\u2019s incredibly easy to earn Avios, so even if you\u2019ve never flown with British Airways before, you could still be in luck. Let\u2019s dive into everything you need to know about booking short-haul American Airlines flights through British Airways\u2019 Executive Club loyalty program. Why you can use British Airways Avios on American Airlines flights While it may not seem logical \u2014 especially if you never plan to travel to the UK\u00a0\u2014 US travelers should care about the British Airways Executive Club. British Airways and American Airlines are both part of the Oneworld alliance, a global network of airlines, which also includes airlines such as Australia\u2019s Qantas, Japan Airlines and Spain\u2019s Iberia. An airline alliance frequently offers travelers the ability to search and book flights through each other\u2019s frequent flyer programs, and travelers with elite status get additional benefits such as complimentary lounge access and priority check-in even when traveling with a partner airline. So, with that in mind, in the Oneworld alliance, travelers can search for American Airlines flights directly through British Airways\u2019 website. And yes, you can use British Airways Avios even if you aren\u2019t flying to or from the United Kingdom. In fact, some of the best ways to use Avios are right here in the United States on American Airlines flights. How to interpret the British Airways award chart for AA flights Knowing you can use British Airways Avios for free American Airlines flights is the first step. Next comes learning how many Avios you\u2019ll need in order to take you where you need to go. In other words, it\u2019s time to get to know British Airways\u2019 award chart, which prices out exactly how many Avios you\u2019ll need to spend. British Airways uses what\u2019s known as a distance-based award chart. That means you\u2019ll use more Avios the farther you fly, but it also means the inverse \u2014 you\u2019ll need fewer points for short distances. British Airways has a separate award chart for flights on partners like American Airlines, which is what we\u2019ll focus on. Figuring out how many miles are between airports may sound difficult, but it couldn\u2019t be easier. You can use websites like Great Circle Mapper to plug in your departure and arrival airports and find out how many miles your flight will be. With that in mind, let\u2019s break down how many Avios you would need for short-haul flights to a few destinations around the US. If you wanted to fly from Miami (MIA) to Atlanta (ATL), for example, you\u2019d only need 8,250 Avios and $5.60 in taxes and fees for an economy flight, provided there\u2019s award availability on your travel dates. That\u2019s because the flight is just 595 miles in distance, which is fewer than the 650-mile cap under the Zone 1 North America line of BA\u2019s partner award chart. A flight between Chicago (ORD) and Dallas (DFW) is over 650 miles in distance, which puts it in the Zone 2 band on BA\u2019s partner award chart. That means you\u2019d need 11,000 Avios plus $5.60 in taxes to book the flight in economy \u2014 provided there\u2019s award availability. This, as opposed to paying cash for the flights that can often cost hundreds of dollars. Once you\u2019re ready to see how you can use Avios for American flights, you can search for award availability via British Airways\u2019 website. You\u2019ll need to create a free Executive Club account in order to search and find if there are any award seats available on your dates of travel. How you can earn British Airways Avios Even if you\u2019ve never flown with British Airways before, earning Avios is easy to do. In fact, British Airways Avios are some of the easiest points to earn. You can earn Avios by opening a British Airways-branded credit card, by transferring points from other credit cards or by flying with a partner airline and crediting your flight to BA. Let\u2019s take a look at the two easiest ways to earn Avios quickly. Earn Avios via British Airways\u2019 credit card Getting the British Airways Visa Signature\u00ae Card is arguably the easiest way to earn a massive haul of Avios for short-haul flights. The card has an impressive sign-up bonus wherein you can earn 75,000 Avios after you spend $5,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. Plus, with the current welcome offer, you\u2019ll also earn 5 Avios per dollar spent, on up to $10k in gas, grocery stores, and dining purchases for first 12 months. As a regular benefit of the card, you\u2019ll also earn three Avios per $1 spent on purchases with British Airways, along with its partners Aer Lingus, Iberia and Level. You\u2019ll also earn two Avios per dollar spent on hotel accommodations when purchased directly with the hotel. Finally, you\u2019ll earn one Avios per dollar spent on all other purchases. What\u2019s unique about this card is while it does have a sizable sign-up bonus, the card has a modest $95 annual fee, which is perfect for travelers who don\u2019t want to pay hundreds of dollars per year to keep a travel rewards credit card open. Earn Avios via transfer partners If you\u2019ve got a travel rewards credit card that earns points in a transferable currency, you could also be in good shape. That\u2019s because British Airways is a transfer partner of several of the programs. For example, you can transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae points earned from cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card to British Airways at a 1-to-1 ratio, which means you\u2019ll get one Avios for every Chase point you transfer. It\u2019s the same for American Express Membership Rewards\u00ae and Capital One miles, where one Membership Rewards point and one Capital One mile equals one Avios. Finally, if you\u2019ve got a load of Marriott Bonvoy points in your account, they can also transfer to British Airways \u2014 though at a less-than-favorable 3-to-1 ratio. Most of these partners transfer to British Airways instantly, so you should see your miles in your Avios account shortly after initiating the transfer. Bottom line Ultimately, having the option to save money on flights is a terrific thing to have. Better yet, you can save on flights within the US using a mileage currency that\u2019s often overlooked by way of British Airways\u2019 Avios. Next time you see exorbitant airfare, consider putting your travel rewards to use. Looking for a travel credit card?

            "text": "The first launch in more than a year of Blue Origin\u2019s New Shepard tourism rocket, designed to vault paying customers on brief trips to the edge of space, was scrubbed Monday morning. The Jeff Bezos-founded company said the scrub of the uncrewed science mission was \u201cdue to a ground system issue the team is troubleshooting,\u201d according to an update shared on X, formerly known as Twitter. Initially, Monday\u2019s launch of New Shepard was delayed by an hour due to cold temperatures at the launch site at Blue Origin\u2019s facilities on a private ranch in West Texas, according to the company. Blue Origin said it will make another launch attempt Tuesday beginning at 11:37 AM ET. The launch will stream live on the company\u2019s website. The mission would have marked the rocket\u2019s return to flight after Blue Origin spent months recuperating from a failed uncrewed test flight. New Shepard\u2019s 2022 failure A New Shepard rocket and spacecraft were set to launch a batch of science instruments on September 12, 2022. But one minute into flight, the rocket endured Max Q \u2014 an aerospace term that refers to a moment of maximum stress on a vehicle at a relatively low altitude where the atmosphere is still fairly thick, and the rocket is moving at nearly the speed of sound. Around that time, the rocket appeared to emit a massive burst of flames. The New Shepard capsule, which rides atop the rocket, then initiated its launch abort system \u2014 firing up a small engine to blast itself safely away from the malfunctioning rocket. That system worked as intended, parachuting the capsule to a safe landing. Blue Origin later revealed that the cause of the failure was a problem with the engine nozzle, a large cone that directs the flaming exhaust at the rocket\u2019s bottom. Onboard computers accurately detected the failure and shut the engine down, according to the company. No injuries were reported on the ground, and Blue Origin said the science payloads and the capsule could be flown again. But the rocket, left without a functioning engine, smashed back into the ground and was completely destroyed. Typically after New Shepard launches, the rocket booster guides itself back to a safe upright landing so it can be flown again. During a Thursday interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Bezos\u00a0 said that the escape system that jettisoned the capsule to safety is the most difficult piece of engineering in the entire rocket \u2014 but \u201cit is the reason that I am comfortable letting anyone go on New Shepard.\u201d \u201cThe (rocket) booster is as safe and reliable as we can make it,\u201d Bezos added. \u201cThe power density is so enormous that it is impossible to ever be sure that nothing will go wrong. \u2026 So the only way to improve safety is to have an escape system. \u201cA tourism vehicle has to be designed in my view \u2026 to be as safe as one can make it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make it perfectly safe. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d What went wrong When New Shepard does lift off again, a success could tee up the company to restart its trips to space for thrill seekers. Before the September 2022 failure, New Shepard rockets had flown 22 consecutive successful missions \u2014 including six with passengers on board.\u00a0Bezos flew aboard the rocket\u00a0in 2021. The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches and is charged with ensuring public safety, oversaw an investigation into the failure. The probe revealed that the engine nozzle failed because it experienced higher temperatures than what the company had anticipated. To fix the issue, Blue Origin said it implemented \u201cdesign changes to the combustion chamber\u201d \u2014 the area of the engine where fuel explosively mixes with oxidizer \u2014 and adjusted \u201coperating parameters,\u201d or the data that the company uses to model safe flights. \u201cAdditional design changes to the nozzle have improved structural performance under thermal and dynamic loads,\u201d the company said in a March statement. The FAA formally concluded the mishap investigation on September 27, outlining 21 \u201ccorrective actions\u201d Blue Origin must implement before returning to flight. The agency did not reveal details on what those actions were, noting the report \u201ccontains proprietary data and U.S \u00a0Export Control information and is not available for public release.\u201d New Glenn on the horizon New Shepard\u2019s expected return to flight comes as Blue Origin is racing to deliver on another key project: It\u2019s developing a massive rocket called New Glenn that\u2019s capable of hauling satellites and other large payloads into orbit. That rocket is years overdue. And the same engines that will power New Glenn\u2019s rocket booster, the BE-4 engines, will also fuel a new line of rockets developed by United Launch Alliance \u2014 a joint Lockheed Martin and Boeing venture. United Launch Alliance\u2019s new Vulcan Centaur rocket is slated to launch its first mission, delivering a NASA-sponsored lander to the moon, in January. New Glenn likewise has an important first launch on the horizon, potentially carrying a NASA satellite to study the magnetized area of space around Mars as soon as next year. Bezos admitted during last week\u2019s podcast interview that he is \u201cextremely nervous\u201d about the first launch of New Glenn. \u201cEvery launch I go to, for New Shepard, for other vehicles, too, I\u2019m always nervous for these launches,\u201d he said. \u201cA first launch \u2014 to have no nervousness about that \u2014 would be some sign of derangement.\u201d",

            "text": "United is in the midst of revamping its narrow-body fleet, and the Airbus A321neo is a big part of said plans. The airline ordered 130 of these aircraft, and the first two just went into service with flights from Chicago O\u2019Hare (ORD). And while domestic jets aren\u2019t usually the most interesting planes in the sky, this plane has a lot to be excited about in both first class and economy. It\u2019s outfitted with the latest tech \u2014 think 4K seat-back screens, Bluetooth audio and wireless charging \u2014 as well as larger overhead storage bins for carry-on bags. So, what\u2019s it like to fly this brand-new plane? Let\u2019s take a look at my experience onboard United\u2019s Airbus A321neo on a flight from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale. Your first look at United\u2019s new domestic first-class product on the Airbus A321neo United\u2019s Airbus A321neo has 20 first-class seats, making it one of the larger first-class cabins in United\u2019s fleet. On my flight from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale, the cabin was booked solid prior to departure, with only one complimentary upgrade clearing at the gate. After you board the plane, you\u2019ll notice its first-class seats are completely redesigned from older planes in the United fleet. They more modern, with marble accents, sharp lines and privacy dividers. But tech is where this new cabin really shines. Each first-class seat has a massive 13-inch 4K OLED seat-back screen with a plethora of movies, TV shows and entertainment to choose from. It\u2019s by far the best-looking screen I\u2019ve seen on a domestic plane. Even better, you can connect your AirPods or other Bluetooth headphones to the plane\u2019s in-flight entertainment screen. Each seat \u2014 in both first class in economy \u2014 has Bluetooth capability. Each first-class seat has a USB-A, USB-C and power outlet underneath the in-flight entertainment screen. Plus, there\u2019s a wireless charging pad in the armrest. This brings United\u2019s first-class cabin up to date with modern charging standards, and I\u2019d love to see them update the rest of the fleet with the same capabilities. There\u2019s plenty of storage, with area for a laptop under the armrest and another cubby at knee level. There\u2019s also a small shelf underneath the seat-back display for your phone while it charges. Onboard service on my flight to Fort Lauderdale was standard for a United domestic first-class flight. Since the flight was over 800 miles, there was meal service. We were also served a pre-departure beverage \u2014 water or sparkling wine \u2014 before leaving the gate. Flight attendants were attentive and friendly. Wi-Fi is available on United\u2019s A321neo for $10 per domestic flight, though the price drops to $8 per flight if you\u2019re a United MileagePlus member. It\u2019s fast too, with 50+ mbps download speeds. United\u2019s A321neo economy cabin has major improvements too United gave CNN Underscored access to the plane before boarding, so I was able to check out the 180-seat economy cabin too. While the seats themselves look similar to economy seats you\u2019ll find on other United aircraft, there are some major tech improbvements. For example, seat-back entertainment got a big upgrade with 12-inch 4K OLED displays. And like in first class, Bluetooth audio and USB-C ports are present. Elite members will like this new cabin too, since there are 57 Economy Plus seats at the front of the cabin, which United Premier Gold elite members and higher can reserve for free at the time of booking. How to fly United\u2019s new first-class seat As mentioned, United\u2019s A321neo is only flying between Chicago O\u2019Hare (ORD) and Fort Lauderdale (FLL) and Phoenix (PHX) at the time of writing. It will expand service from Chicago to Orlando (MCO), Fort Meyers (RSW) and Las Vegas (LAS) on Jan. 9, 2024, and we expect more routes to come as the airline takes delivery of more aircraft. How much you\u2019ll pay for a first-class seat varies widely on when and where you fly. The cheapest A321neo route we could find in February 2024 was Chicago to Orlando for $314, which is a solid deal on this route. Most dates on this route \u2014 or others operated by this aircraft \u2014 will cost roughly double that. So, you might consider redeeming airline miles or credit card points for your ticket. United MileagePlus prices award tickets dynamically, meaning award prices vary by day, route and other factors. One example flight on the Chicago to Orlando route costs 37,700 miles in first class, but it could be more or less depending on the day you fly. You can earn United miles with these credit cards: Alternatively, if you have American Express Membership Rewards\u00ae, Bilt Rewards, Capital One Miles or Citi ThankYou points, you can book dates with saver award space by transferring points to Avianca LifeMiles. Chicago to Florida routes cost 25,000 LifeMiles, plus minimal taxes and fees, though award space is minimal. Bottom line United\u2019s new Airbus A321neo is a great addition to its fleet and a glimpse into the future of United\u2019s aircraft. I\u2019m a huge fan of the upgraded technology and new seats, which bring the plane up to date with modern charging standards and make the in-flight entertainment experience more enjoyable. Keep an eye out for United\u2019s Airbus A321neo the next time you\u2019re booking a flight. With 130 aircraft set to join the fleet, it\u2019s bound to fly to an airport near you sooner than later.

On October 5, two days before the attack, there were 63 airlines serving Tel Aviv with a total of 256 fights to the airport, according to data from aviation analytics firm Cirium. El Al accounted for about 26% of those flights. Lufthansa had five flights a day to Tel Aviv at that time, or 2% of the total. The most recent data for Thursday shows only 10 airlines serving the airport with a total of 72 flights, and with El Al responsible for 76% of that flight volume. The three US airlines that had served Tel Aviv - American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines - all said their flights to Israel remain halted.

American Airlines, the country\u2019s largest carrier, expects Friday, December 22, to be its busiest of a 19-day-long holiday travel period that begins Wednesday, December 20. In all, the airline plans to serve 12.7 million passengers. \u201cThe 2023 holiday period is longer than previous years, reflecting the changing travel habits of our customers and school schedules in many of American\u2019s hub markets,\u201d the airline said. The Federal Aviation Administration says holiday air traffic\u00a0overall\u00a0will peak on the Thursday before Christmas with the agency\u2019s air traffic controllers handling\u00a048,959 flights. In a sign of how spread out winter holiday travel has become,\u00a0Delta Air Lines spokesperson Morgan Durant told CNN that there is a \u201cseven-way tie\u201d for that carrier\u2019s busiest days. Delta is expecting to serve around 9 million people in total, including 600,000 customers each day on December 21 and 22 as well as from December 26 to 30. Industry lobby group Airlines for America says that 2.8 million passengers will fly each day overall during the holiday rush, representing a 16% increase in the number of holiday fliers\u00a0over\u00a02022.

That appeared to pay off over Thanksgiving when very few flights were canceled, though the airlines also benefited from favorable weather. Figures from FlightAware show that US-based airlines canceled only 329 flights during the week of Thanksgiving, a rate of less than 1%, when Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said weather would be the \u201cx-factor.\u201d United Airlines plans to fly around 9 million people, a 12% increase over last year.

            "text": "If you\u2019ve ever wanted to own a piece of the iconic A380 superjumbo, here\u2019s your chance: Emirates is preparing to launch a limited-edition collection of luggage and accessories made from upcycled parts, sourced from the carrier\u2019s Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft. The collection includes suitcases, backpacks, handbags, cardholders, toiletry bags, belts and shoes, all fashioned in-house and handmade by a team of tailors at an Emirates Engineering facility in Dubai. Scheduled for sale in 2024, the collection is entirely made to order, meaning customers will be able to request items to personal specifications or include engravings of their initials. All proceeds will be donated to children in need, via the Emirates Airline Foundation. The initiative is part of a large retrofit project involving 120 aircraft, which are getting entirely new interiors. Old cabin components are usually recycled, but Emirates says it is upcycling materials from First and Business classes for the collection. Items collected so far include seatbelts, headrests, leather from A380 lounges and fur from the lining of cockpit seats. The airline says that more than 30,000 pounds of material has been recovered from 16 aircraft so far, with plans to obtain up to 595 pounds of leather and 1,382 pounds of seat fabric for each refurbished aircraft. A piece of history A selection of items from the collection was displayed at the Dubai Air Show in November, made with leather from First Class, Business class and Sofa seats, as well as aluminum from headrests. \u201cWe have produced a carry-on case and backpacks which are already garnering a lot of interest,\u201d says Ahmed Safa, Emirates\u2019 divisional senior vice president for engineering. \u201cThe leather is laundered in our partner facility, then further deep cleaned by hand, then leather-conditioned, and thoroughly disinfected before being made into the case and bags. Brand new lining is added along with the handle and clasps. We have an in-house workshop and dedicated team in Emirates Engineering where most of this activity happens. \u201cThe idea for the different designs come from our internal team, who looked up current styles and popular luggage shapes and functional backpacks to create patterns for each piece.\u201d Work is carried out by a group called Engineering Maintenance Assistants, an in-house team of 14 tailors who are usually tasked with maintenance of cabin fittings. Four of them are currently working exclusively on the initiative, says Emirates. When aircraft reach the end of their life, they are usually recycled by specialist companies that can recover up to 90% of the material to give it a second life. Emirates had previously auctioned for charity a few hundred items from one of its decommissioned A380s. But the materials used for the new collection come from planes that are still in service, and that the airline is refreshing with redesigned cabins. The retrofit process, which started in 2022 and is expected to take two years, involves 67 A380s and 53 777s, which will see about 4,000 new seats installed and thousands of First Class suites and Business Class seats refurbished and upgraded to new designs. \u201cEmirates has not had this massive aircraft retrofit initiative before, so we have not had these materials before in any quantity,\u201d Safa says. \u201cOnce the retrofit is complete, we will not have any more fabrics to work with. It\u2019s a once-off chance to own a piece of aviation history.\u201d The work didn\u2019t come without challenges, Safa adds, such as how to clean the fur lining from the Captain\u2019s seats without damaging it. \u201cWe are now using an air cleaning method and disinfection,\u201d he explains. Other airlines have previously created collections made from upcycled plane parts, including Lufthansa, which released a line of home furniture and accessories with components taken from a retired A340-600. According to Nina Gbor, a sustainable fashion expert and educator, upcycled products can sometimes be perceived as lesser quality, but Emirates seems to be doing a good job in exemplifying that upcycling can also be stylish and of good quality. \u201cIt\u2019s also clever to see how they\u2019ve retained and incorporated elements of the aircraft, such as the seat belts, in their original form, and used them as bag straps for example,\u201d she says. Considering there is scope to recover hundreds of pounds of leather and fabric from each aircraft, Gbor hopes that Emirates continues this range beyond just a limited edition. \u201cI also hope that other product manufacturers are inspired by this and commit to using existing materials to redesign and repurpose most or all of their products,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a revolutionary path towards a much-needed circular economy in our world.\u201d",

            "title": "New York plans a $10 billion chip research center with IBM, Micron and others",
            "text": " A new $10 billion mega chip-making complex is coming to New York state. Governor Kathy Hochul announced New York\u2019s efforts to build a High NA Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography research and development center. In a statement Monday, she said the state will invest $1 billion and join forces with chip industry giants including IBM, Micron and Applied Materials to move the project forward. The center will create at least 700 new jobs and could generate an estimated $9 billion in private spending, according to the statement, as well as support talent development through a range of programs including within the workforce and K-12 STEM academic initiatives. The \u201cnext-generation semiconductor research and development center\u201d is set to be built at the Albany NanoTech Complex near the University of Albany, a 1.65 million square-foot complex that has been growing in stages since the 1990s. The complex is operated by NY CREATES, a nonprofit that will also oversee the new center\u2019s construction and install new chip-making equipment acquired from Dutch machinery company ASML Holding. NY CREATES is an acronym for New York Center for Research, Economic Advancement, Technology, Engineering and Science. A bid for federal funding New York\u2019s plans to expand microchip production are intended to enhance the state\u2019s bid for research hub designation under the federal CHIPS and Science Act, a $53 billion bipartisan bill passed last year to help boost America\u2019s chip manufacturing. With the designation, New York could unlock over $11 billion in federal funding with the designation. \u201cWe have a focus on economic development, and it\u2019s really to drive the innovation economy around the region of the Northeast as well as across the nation,\u201d NY CREATES President David Anderson said Tuesday at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS). New York has already made chip production a statewide priority: in January, Hochul announced the creation of the Governor\u2019s Office of Semiconductor Expansion, Manufacturing, and Integration (GO-SEMI), a $45 million effort. Multiple large chip factories already call New York State home, and a $100 billion Micron-funded factory was announced last year. \u201cThis investment in Albany NanoTech will reinforce New York\u2019s position as a global leader in semiconductor research and development,\u201d Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said in the statement. \u201cEstablishing this new semiconductor center will also bolster our national security, allowing the United States to develop the world\u2019s most complex and powerful semiconductors right at home.\u201d New York looks to compete internationally Monday\u2019s announcement shows a doubling down on the state\u2019s continuing efforts to boost the economy and contribute to US efforts to renew semiconductor manufacturing, driven by economic and national security concerns. America is in the midst of an ongoing chip production battle with China, Russia, Iran and other countries, with new rules unveiled in October to further tighten a sweeping set of export controls first introduced last year. The \u201cUS can\u2019t afford to be behind again,\u201d said Gaurav Gupta, a vice president and analyst of emerging technologies and trends at Gartner in an email to CNN. \u201c[T]his will go a long way to create a center where researchers/engineers from private semiconductor companies can come together and work \u2013 NY state can become a semiconductor research and manufacturing hub.\u201d An international trade war over chip production has been a focal point of policy and discussion in recent years, with the US limiting the types of semiconductors American companies can sell to foreign countries and China announcing in July it would curb overseas exports of germanium and gallium, both essential for making semiconductors. Semiconductors are also impacted by soaring global demand for artificial intelligence in the past year, with limits in the supply chain for powerful chips and export bans on some US companies to avoid shipping some chips to China. Tech giants voice concerns about chip issues Multiple companies including Microsoft and OpenAI have voiced concern over the limited supply of graphics processing units (GPUs) and the possible risk factor for investors. \u201cFor the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements,\u201d Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a shareholder letter in October when discussing GPUs. \u201cHowever, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\u201d In another milestone Monday for US chip production, the Department of Commerce announced its first agreement under the CHIPS Act with the United Kingdom\u2019s BAE Systems, Inc. in a $35 million deal going toward modernizing a New Hampshire facility to help quadruple chip production for military aircraft. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is the first step of many to come,\u201d the White House wrote in a release. \u201cIt will advance our national security goals, and it will spur local investment and job creation.\u201d",

            "text": "SpaceX has postponed the next launch of its Falcon Heavy rocket until at least Tuesday evening, delaying the latest mission of a mysterious space plane that remains one of the US military\u2019s most fascinating\u00a0projects\u00a0as the country races to journey deeper into the cosmos. The secretive X-37B robotic spacecraft was set to take off aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket at 8:14 p.m. ET from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Monday. But the company said Monday evening that it was pushing back the launch \u201cdue to a ground side issue\u201d \u2014 indicating a problem with the rocket\u2019s launchpad or fueling systems, according to a social media post from SpaceX. The company said it is now working toward lifting off at the next available launch opportunity, which is Tuesday at 8:14 pm ET. Resembling a miniature NASA space shuttle with the windows blacked out, the reusable X-37B space plane is set to begin its seventh experimental mission. Many of the X-37B\u2019s mysterious tasks have been classified, but the US Space Force did provide a few details about the goals for this uncrewed mission. What X-37B is doing The space plane makes it possible for the United States to carry out experiments to better understand how to improve ongoing and upcoming space operations and push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible, according to a statement by Gen. B. Chance Saltzman, chief of space operations for the US Space Force. Among the research on board will be a NASA experiment that aims to find ways to sustain astronauts on future deep-space missions. Called Seeds-2, it will \u201cexpose plant seeds to the harsh radiation environment of long-duration spaceflight\u201d and build on previous research carried out on X-37B missions. The experiments also \u201cinclude operating the reusable spaceplane in new orbital regimes, experimenting with future space domain awareness technologies, and investigating the radiation effects on materials provided by NASA,\u201d according to the US Space Force. Orbital regimes are areas of space where different celestial bodies have the biggest gravitational influence. If Earth\u2019s gravity is dominant, for example, it\u2019s called the \u201cgeocentric regime.\u201d And our entire solar system is part of the \u201csolar regime,\u201d where the sun is the biggest gravitational source, the US Space Force \u201cSpacepower\u201d publication explains. By \u201cnew orbital regimes,\u201d the military likely is referring to the fact that the X-37B can be placed much deeper into space than previous missions \u2014 perhaps even to the \u201ccislunar regime,\u201d which is defined as the gravitational system that includes Earth and the moon. A powerful ride The launch will mark the first time that the space plane has hitched a ride on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy, which was briefly the most powerful operational rocket in the world after its debut in 2018. The rocket looks like three of the company\u2019s Falcon 9 rockets strapped together, with the two boosters on each side providing additional thrust and power. Previously, the X-37B has launched on the SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle and the Atlas V rocket built by United Launch Alliance, a Lockheed Martin-Boeing joint venture. The Falcon Heavy produces more thrust than both of those rockets combined. Space technology innovations It\u2019s not clear how long the spacecraft will spend orbiting Earth for this stint, though historically each X-37B flight has been increasingly longer than the last. The last trip to orbit for the autonomous X-37B concluded in November 2022, after the spacecraft logged nearly 909 days in space. During that sixth mission, as previously reported by CNN, the space plane carried experimental technology designed by the US Navy to convert solar energy and transmit it back to the ground, according to the military. In August 2020, the X-37B won the prestigious Robert J. Collier Trophy, which honors aerospace achievements,\u00a0besting the Hubble Space Telescope. (The James Webb Space Telescope won the prize most recently.) \u201cSophisticated and uncrewed, the X-37B advances reusable spaceplane technologies and operates experiments in space that are returned for further examination on earth,\u201d said Barbara Barrett, secretary of the US Air Force in a statement at the time. The X-37B has already spent more than 3,700 days in space on prior uncrewed missions.",

            "text": "Shares of Macy\u2019s soared more than 17% early Monday on a Wall Street Journal report that the iconic 165-year old retailer closely associated with the holiday season might itself be bought. The report said the offer, which would pay shareholders a 32% premium above the stock\u2019s closing price Friday, comes from Arkhouse Management, a real-estate focused investing firm, and Brigade Capital Management, a global asset manager, noting that that the bidders had discussed the proposal with Macy\u2019s. It isn\u2019t clear how the retailer views the proposal. Spokespeople for Macy\u2019s and Arkhouse had no comment on the Journal report. Brigade did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Macy\u2019s has 722 store locations in 43 states, Washington, DC; Puerto Rico and Guam. It operates about 500 Macy\u2019s branded stores, as well as 55 of the more upscale Bloomingdale\u2019s branded stores and 160 locations of the beauty and skin-care chain Bluemercury, which it acquired in 2015. \u201cWhere Arkhouse likely sees value is in Macy\u2019s real estate,\u201d said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst with GlobalData.\u00a0\u201cAn investor group that sells off real estate and perhaps takes other actions such as spinning off the ecommerce business, would certainly make some short-term gains.\u201d But this strategy would hurt Macy\u2019s as a retailer, Saunders said. \u201cUnless some of those profits were reinvested in revitalizing the core retail business, it would leave Macy\u2019s in the worst of all worlds,\u201d he said. Macy\u2019s and other traditional department stores have struggled for decades now. Competition both from online retailers like Amazon and big box retailers, such as Walmart and Target \u2013 which offer shoppers the chance to buy groceries as well as clothes and other household goods \u2013 has left Macy\u2019s with a smaller slice of the retail pie. Macy\u2019s has long outlived its early rival, Gimbel\u2019s, which closed in 1986. It is not only known as the sponsor of the Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York, it was one of the pioneers in the 19th century in getting Americans to associate the Christmas holiday with shopping for gifts. The 1947 film \u201cMiracle on 34th Street\u201d about Santa Claus bringing the spirit of Christmas back to retailing is still a holiday classic film more than 75 years after its debut. In recent years Macy\u2019s has closed stores to cut costs. The number of full department stores under the Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s brands is down by a third, or 280 stores, in the last nine years. Its net income in the first three quarters of this fiscal year fell 74% compared to a year earlier. Sales at stores open at least a year were down 7%. Share price is also down from a peak of $73 a share in June of 2015. The $5.8 billion offer being discussed, while a 32% increase from Friday\u2019s closing valuation, is down 75% from that 2015 peak. Since then, Macy\u2019s has spent $3 billion on share repurchases in an unsuccessful attempt to support its steadily declining stock price. In June it cut its annual profit and sales forecast after customer demand slowed. \u201cThe US consumer, particularly at Macy\u2019s, pulled back more than we anticipated,\u201d Macy\u2019s CEO Jeff Gennette said on an earnings call Thursday. Customers \u201creallocated\u201d spending to food, essentials and services, he said. Gennette, who has run the 165-year old retailer for the last seven years, is set to retire in 2024. Investor groups such as private equity funds and hedge funds have been active in recent decades in buying struggling or under-performing retailers, with the stated goal of taking them private, improving their operations and selling them for a profit. But the results have often led to closure, not salvation, for many well-known companies. The new owners often load up the company with unaffordable amounts of debt, and sometimes split the retailers\u2019 extensive real estate holdings apart from its retail operations.\u00a0With the real estate and retail operations now legally belonging to two separate companies, the retail operation is forced to pay rent to the real estate company, which now officially owns the building the stores are in. The long-term prognosis for the legacy retailer in such a set-up might be poor, but it does allow the real estate\u2019s new owner to extract a maximum return on the property. There have been numerous major retailers that have gone out of business once private equity becomes involved. Lord & Taylor, Toys R Us, Payless ShoeSource, Sports Authority, RadioShack, The Limited, Wet Seal, Claire\u2019s and Aeropostale all filed for bankruptcy and closed all their US stores after being purchased by private equity. Sears Holdings, which was bought by a hedge fund and operated both Kmart and Sears, another iconic department store chain, filed for bankruptcy as well, and while it remains in business it has only a handful of locations where it once had hundreds of stores under each brand.",

            "text": "Cinemagoers in Japan will soon be able to see box office hit \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d months after much of the rest of the world. The blockbuster\u2019s release was postponed amid controversy over an unofficial marketing campaign that critics said trivialized the 1945 nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Film distributor Bitters End said in a statement posted to social media Thursday that the movie, directed by Christopher Nolan, would be released in Japan in 2024. \u201cIt is being referred to as \u2018Nolan\u2019s ultimate masterpiece\u2019 and gaining attention as a prime contender in all film awards categories,\u201d read the statement posted on Instagram. A specific release date wasn\u2019t announced. The three-hour biopic has broken several records since its global release earlier this year, becoming the highest-grossing movie set during World War II, according to Universal. However, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d was also at the center of some controversy. The movie, which tells the story of\u00a0J. Robert Oppenheimer, considered the father of the atomic bomb, was released on the same July weekend as \u201cBarbie,\u201d a film about the iconic Mattel doll, in many parts of the world. As a result, many people went to see both movies as a kind of double-header, and social media was awash with unofficial fan-made \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d memes. The posts\ufeff triggered outrage in Japan, and the Warner Bros. Film Group apologized after the X account, formerly Twitter, for its \u201cBarbie\u201d film sparked backlash over its embrace of memes that appeared to depict the character immersed in atomic blast imagery from \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d The posts from the official \u201cBarbie\u201d account responding to the unofficial memes were later deleted. But screengrabs posted on X showed the \u201cBarbie\u201d account responding positively to a meme of a mushroom cloud superimposed on the head of Margot Robbie, the film\u2019s star, and to another post depicting \u201cOppenheimer\u201d actor Cillian Murphy carrying a cheerful Barbie on his shoulder against a burning backdrop. Critics said the posts trivialized the nuclear attacks on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the US Air Force in 1945, which killed at least 110,000 people instantly and tens of thousands more from its aftereffects. Warner Bros. Film Group said in a statement to CNN at the time: \u201cWarner Brothers regrets its recent insensitive social media engagement. The studio offers a sincere apology.\u201d Warner Bros., like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery. Meanwhile, a rival hashtag \u2013 \u201cNoBarbenheimer\u201d \u2013 garnered attention on social media in Japan, with people using it to criticize the \u201cBarbie\u201d account\u2019s conflation of the two films. Jeffrey J. Hall, a US academic based in Tokyo,\u00a0tweeted: \u201cThe #NoBarbenheimer controversy is a reminder of the perception gap between Japan and the US over the issue of nuclear weapons. \u201cJapanese grow up learning about the horrors of the a-bombs and every year\u2019s memorial ceremonies are treated as national news \u2026 Although 78 years have passed, these events are far from forgotten in Japan.\u201d",

            "text": "Alaska Air (ALK) on Sunday announced it will buy rival Hawaiian Airlines (HA) for $1.9 billion. The acquisition was the culmination of \u201cseveral months\u201d of negotiations, according to Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci. It will include $900 million in Hawaiian Airlines debt. \u201cThis is a fantastic deal that bring two airlines that have amazing loyalties in our regions together,\u201d said Minicucci in a news conference, adding that the merger will give customers in both states expanded domestic and international choices. The deal, which is forecast to take between nine and 18 months, will see both companies keep their brands, a unique decision Minicucci and Hawaiian Airlines CEO and President Peter Ingram say was made out of respect for the nearly 100-year legacy of the two airlines and the communities they serve. Both states are \u201cuniquely reliant upon air travel,\u201d Alaska Airlines said in a news release Sunday. The airline currently serves 19 cities, many of which are not connected by roads. Alaska will pay $18 a share in cash for each share of Hawaiian Airlines under the terms of the deal, a 270% premium over Friday\u2019s closing price. Hawaiian shares, which had been down more than 50% so far this year, soared more than 180% in midday trading, while shares of Alaska Air fell about 15% in trading. Antitrust approval needed to close deal The deal would need to be approved by federal antitrust regulators before it could be complete. Most airline mergers in recent decades have been approved with little trouble, which has allowed a series of mergers that took the 11 largest US airlines down to only four major carriers that control 80% of the nation\u2019s air traffic. But the Biden administration has taken a much harder line on antitrust issues, particularly on airline mergers, arguing that they result in higher fares by reducing choices for passengers. It has already won the end of an alliance between American Airlines and JetBlue in the Northeast United States, and it is challenging a proposed merger between JetBlue and Spirit Airlines. Closing arguments in a federal court case in that merger are due to begin on Tuesday. But Minicucci said that while he has not spoken to regulators about his proposed deal, he said this merger would be different between other airline combinations in which the two airlines serve many of the same routes. \u201cWhen you combine these complementary networks, we\u2019ll have about 1,400 flights a day,\u201d said Minicucci on a call with investors Sunday.\u00a0\u201cOn those 1,400 flights, we only have 12 overlap markets. So from a competitive standpoint, I think that lands really, really well.\u201d But data from Cirium, an aviation analytics firm, shows that Hawaiian airlines has 24% of the available seats on flights between the mainland United States and Hawaii, and Alaska already has 15%, the fourth most behind Hawaiian, United and Southwest, so combining the two would give a single carrier nearly 40% of the capacity on those flights. CIrium\u2019s data also shows the two airlines\u2019 average fares between the mainland and Hawaii at just over $290 one-way, very close to one another, and more than 8% below the industrywide average. So allowing the two to merge would remove one of the lower cost carriers from the market, even if Southwest remains. Those facts could set off concerns among regulators. Financial problems for Hawaiian Hawaiian Airlines has been struggling financially, and appeared to be in the need of a partner. While major US airlines have all returned to profitability with the help of strong demand for travel and high airfares, Hawaiian has been facing increased competition in its home market from the entry of Southwest Airlines into the market in 2019. The increased competition has driven down the average revenue from passengers for every available seat Hawaiian Airlines flies, a key measure of airfares. That fare measure is lower compared both to a year ago, and to the same period before the pandemic. It has only reported one profitable quarter since the start of the pandemic, and losses have increased in the latest quarter as well as year-to-date, despite lower fuel costs. Part of the financial strain comes from rising labor costs. At the start of the year it reached a deal with its pilots union that will increase wages 32% over the four years of the contract, including an immediate 16% pay hike. While pay increases of that magnitude have become common across the airline industry, the new contracts have helped to raise labor costs at the airline by 18% so far this year. The merger would also shape Honolulu into the company\u2019s second-largest hub, \u201cenabling greater international connectivity for West Coast travelers throughout the Asia-Pacific region with one-stop service through Hawaii,\u201d according to the news release. Alaska Airlines\u2019 fleet will expand from about 300 to 365 planes, and serve a total of 138 destinations, including \u201cnon-stop service to 29 top international destinations in the Americas, Asia, Australia and the South Pacific,\u201d the company said in the release. Given Alaska\u2019s membership in the Oneworld international airline alliance, Hawaiian Airlines loyalty customers will have access to improved benefits such as lounge access, an enhanced credit card loyalty program and the ability to earn and redeem more miles. \u201cIn Alaska Airlines, we are joining an airline that has long served Hawaii, and has a complementary network and a shared culture of service,\u201d said Ingram. \u201cWith the additional scale and resources that this transaction with Alaska Airlines brings, we will be able to accelerate investments in our guest experience and technology, while maintaining the Hawaiian Airlines brand.\u201d Minicucci, who will become the CEO of both airlines, heralded the move as \u201cpro-consumer\u201d and would allow for the nation\u2019s fifth-largest airline to compete more robustly with United, Delta, Southwest and American Airlines, which currently own 80% of the domestic market share.",

While Musk and Bezos have notoriously been publicly competitive and have a history of openly sparring on social media, with Musk regularly making crude jokes about Bezos and Blue Origin, it is not uncommon for business rivals to team up in the world of rocket launches. Some Amazon satellites will still ride on a large rocket made by Blue Origin, dubbed the New Glenn. But it\u2019s been delayed for years and will make its launch debut next year at the earliest. Amazon announced the deal in a news release Friday, saying the company has signed an agreement to launch its satellites on three SpaceX Falcon 9 launches, which are expected to begin as soon as mid-2025. Amazon is working to build a constellation of thousands of internet satellites, called Project Kuiper, that is planned to beam connectivity across the planet. It will compete directly with SpaceX\u2019s Starlink service, which already has more than 5,000 satellites in orbit. Amazon is well behind its competitor. It has two prototype satellites, which were launched in October aboard a rocket built by United Launch Alliance, which is a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The Jeff Bezos-founded company made headlines in April 2022 when it signed a contract worth billions of dollars to launch Kuiper satellites on 77 rockets built by Blue Origin \u2014 another Bezos-founded venture \u2014 as well as ULA and European launch provider Arianespace. But those initial contracts also spurred a shareholder lawsuit. Filed by the The Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund in August, the lawsuit alleges Amazon executives \u201cconsciously and intentionally breached their most basic fiduciary responsibilities\u201d in part by forgoing the option of launching Project Kuiper satellites on rockets built by SpaceX, which the suit claims is \u201cone of the most cost-effective launch providers.\u201d \u201cThe claims in this lawsuit are completely without merit, and we look forward to showing that through the legal process,\u201d said an Amazon spokesperson at the time. In its statement Friday, Amazon said that the earlier deal \u201cprovides enough capacity to launch the majority of our satellite constellation, and the additional launches with SpaceX offer even more capacity to support our deployment schedule.\u201d Regardless of who gets to launch the satellites, however, first Amazon must get the satellites to work. In an interview last month, Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper, told CNN the prototypes were wholly successful. \u201cSo far, everything that we\u2019ve tested on ground, we\u2019re getting the same results up in space,\u201d Badyal said. That paves the way for Amazon to begin launching more batches of operational satellites. Badyal said the company is planning to begin beta testing the service with customers as soon as late 2024.",

PDD reported blockbuster third-quarter earnings Tuesday, smashing analyst expectations. Revenue soared 94% to 68.8 billion yuan ($9.7 billion) compared with the same period in the previous year, while operating profit surged 60% year-on-year to nearly $16.7 billion (about $2.3 billion).

Ma went on to congratulate PDD on its recent strong performance, adding that \u201cthe era of AI e-commerce has just begun, and it is an opportunity and a challenge for everyone.\u201d \u201cI firmly believe that Alibaba will change,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEveryone has been awesome, but those who can reform for tomorrow and are willing to pay any price and sacrifice are respected. Back to our mission and vision, Alibaba people, come on!\u201d Ma founded Alibaba in 1999. He\u00a0stepped down\u00a0as chairman of the company in 2019, about\u00a0a year before\u00a0landing in hot water with Chinese authorities for criticizing the country\u2019s financial regulators and banks. Since then, the entrepreneur has kept a relatively low profile while remaining an Alibaba shareholder. Alibaba\u2019s shares have tumbled 15% so far this year as it battles concerns over a sweeping restructuring, a leadership shuffle and fierce competition. Meanwhile, PDD has enjoyed a bumper year. On Tuesday, chairman and co-CEO Chen Lei attributed its results in part to the recovery of the Chinese economy, which he said on an analyst call was \u201cclearly felt\u201d by the company. PDD, which was founded in 2015, has also recently attracted international attention for its launch of Temu, an affordable online superstore that has become hugely popular in markets such as the United States and Australia. Temu sells everything from home goods to apparel and electronics.",

            "text": "The pre-dawn fog was so dense when two jets nearly collided\u00a0on\u00a0an Austin airport runway that the air traffic controller could\u00a0see\u00a0only the lights of\u00a0one aircraft, and a pilot could\u00a0only make out the \u201csilhouette of the left wing\u201d\u00a0on\u00a0the other. These\u00a0details\u00a0are from first-hand accounts of the February incident,\u00a0one of the most serious in a series of\u00a0near-collisions at US runways this year, and includes pilots and air traffic controllers\u2019 interviews with investigators.\u00a0The National Transportation Safety Board\u00a0on\u00a0Wednesday released more than 2,000 pages of interviews, transcripts, air traffic control recordings, and flight track data it has collected\u00a0on\u00a0the February 4 incident. The crew of the landing FedEx aircraft, a 767 cargo jet with three crew\u00a0members onboard, told investigators the plane was\u00a0on\u00a0autopilot for the approach into Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. They were aware of a Southwest Airlines 737 jet, with 128 passengers and crew, that was cleared to depart from the same runway, and had confirmed with air traffic controllers their clearance to land. FedEx co-pilot Robert J. Bradeen, Jr. said that \u201cprobably 100 to 150 feet\u201d above the point where the plane would land, he was alternating his view from outside and inside the airplane. He said during \u201cone of [the] glance-outs there was a white light that did not match the runway lighting.\u201d Bradeen said the light \u201cquickly morphed into a silhouette of the left wing with the airplane, just above the glare shield from my point of view.\u201d The FedEx crew called for the Southwest crew to abort the takeoff. Concurrently, the FedEx crew aborted their landing. The air traffic controller who had cleared both flights told investigators in a separate interview that he could\u00a0see\u00a0nothing\u00a0on\u00a0the ground through the fog \u2014 a type of fog he\u2019d experienced \u201cmaybe a handful of times.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any ground visibility,\u201d said controller Damian Campbell, who has worked at Austin for four years. \u201cI mean, you couldn\u2019t see anything.\u00a0You couldn\u2019t see the approach end of the runway, we couldn\u2019t see our turnoff points.\u201d Campbell had\u00a0only\u00a0seen a landing light of the approaching FedEx plane through the fog and never actually saw the Southwest plane as it taxied. Campbell described a confidence that Southwest pilots would take off promptly after being cleared\u00a0onto the runway.\u00a0He said the airline is the \u201conly carrier that I would do any squeeze play with.\u201d Because he could not\u00a0see\u00a0the Southwest plane, he described realizing it may not have departed yet because he \u2014 in the tower \u2014 could not \u201chear the engines of the 737.\u201d About 21 seconds before the urgent FedEx abort instruction, he radioed the Southwest pilots to ask if they were departing. \u201cRollin now,\u201d the Southwest crew replied, according to a transcript of the radio exchanges published by the\u00a0NTSB. Campbell told investigators he did not know why he did not call off the FedEx plane\u2019s landing clearance, but suggested he was concerned if he called them off too late, the two planes could collide in the air. \u201cSo if he\u2019s coming down, and we give him a go-around that\u2019s short and Southwest is actually rotating, we make a worse situation even worse,\u201d\u00a0 he said. He said in hindsight he could have stopped the Southwest flight from taking off as well. \u201cIt looked to be a safe operation. But hindsight being 20/20, definitely could have held them,\u201d he said noting the poor visibility would have been a reason to stop it and put more separation between the arriving and departing planes. Campbell also told investigators that he was working an overtime shift. Because of staffing issues at the tower, he said, controllers were scheduled for six-day workweeks.",

Be prepared,\u201d he said at the 2023 New York Times DealBook Summit in New York. \u201cInterest rates may go up and that might lead to recession.\u201d Governments across the globe need more money, he said, to fund the green economy, remilitarize and to address energy crises \u2014 and that will all be inflationary. \u201cI\u2019m cautious about the economy,\u201d he said. The labor market in the United States has been resilient, but \u201cinflation is hurting people.\u201d Stimulus money handed out during Covid shutdowns and quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve had injected \u201cdrugs directly into our system\u201d and caused an economic \u201csugar high,\u201d said Dimon. But that\u2019s fading. \u201cI think quantitative easing and tightening and these geopolitical issues can bite,\u201d he said. In previous interviews, Dimon has said that the Fed may be far from finished with its aggressive regimen of interest rate hikes in the fight against elevated inflation, and that it\u2019s possible the central bank will continue hiking rates by another 1.5 percentage points, to 7%. Geopolitical woes Dimon stressed that this may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades and that the wars in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza could have far-reaching impacts on energy and food supply, trade and geopolitical relationships. It could even, he said, lead to \u201cnuclear blackmail.\u201d Mankind faces huge risks, he said. One is obviously war in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. But beyond that, Dimon is worried about nuclear proliferation, climate change and the risk of another pandemic. The United States, he said, needs to make sure it has \u201cthe best military in the world, bar none.\u201d It\u2019s an expensive task, he said, but the stakes are high, \u201cThis is about keeping the Western world together,\u201d he said at the DealBook Summit. \u201cWe need American leadership to make sure this all stays together. I don\u2019t want a book written in 50 years about how the West lost.\u201d Business in China JPMorgan Chase does business with TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance and is partially underwriting the planned IPO of Chinese fast-fashion company Shein, according to a recent report from Reuters. Dimon said on Wednesday that he\u2019ll follow the lead of the US government when it comes to doing business in China but that he believes companies like Shein do not present a threat to US national security. While some US lawmakers have said that TikTok is a national security threat, Dimon countered that JPMorgan Chase does due diligence on all of its clients. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of China,\u201d he said.",

            "text": "For the first time, a transatlantic flight operated by a commercial airline will be powered by 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) \u2014 a type of plane fuel that bears the promise of a much lower climate impact than traditional ones. Traveling from London Heathrow to New York\u2019s JFK, the flight, which is meant purely as a demonstration and will not carry any paying passengers (although it will carry scientists and media), is operated by Virgin Atlantic using a Boeing 787, with both its engines running on the fuel. However, while Virgin Atlantic says that using SAF will reduce the aircraft\u2019s emissions by 70%, critics say the flight is little more than a gimmick, and that the kind of SAF used by the plane will do little to clean up aviation\u2019s climate impact. Commercial restrictions Current regulations prohibit airlines from using a blend of more than 50% SAF on commercial flights, as engine manufacturers and aviation authorities work together to ensure that these new fuels are safe to use in higher concentrations. To operate the flight, a special permit was issued by the UK Civil Aviation Authority, which came after a series of technical reviews including ground tests with 100% SAF on the same type of engines used during the flight. The flight is the latest in a series of recent tests involving 100% SAF. Last week, Emirates powered one of the four engines of an Airbus A380 superjumbo with it. Days earlier, business jet maker Gulfstream completed what it billed as the world\u2019s first transatlantic flight using 100% SAF. Large twin-engine jets have performed flights using 100% SAF on both engines before, but these flights involved military aircraft. The flight will use a total of 70 tons of SAF, mostly made from waste cooking oils and animal fat, plus a small portion coming from corn waste used to produce animal feed. Virgin Atlantic says that the SAF alone will cut the flight\u2019s emissions by 70%, but it is also adopting other measures to limit environmental impact and increase efficiency, such as operating the taxi phase (when the plane goes from gate to runway) with just one engine, and limiting the amount of potable water onboard to what is strictly necessary, reducing weight. SAF is a big bet for commercial aviation, which produces about 2.5% of global carbon emissions but is facing a harder path to decarbonize than other sectors. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF will play a major role in the industry\u2019s path to net zero, which it hopes to achieve by 2050: by then, up to 65% of the reductions in emissions will come from it. Although SAF burns like normal jet fuel and produces the same amount of emissions while the plane is flying, it has a lower carbon footprint during its entire production cycle, because it\u2019s usually made from plants that have absorbed carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere when they were alive. That CO2 is released back into the atmosphere when the SAF burns, whereas burning jet fuel made from fossil fuels emits carbon that had been locked away. Not all SAFs are equal SAF can be made in several different ways, including using exclusively renewable energy rather than plant waste. However, it is currently more expensive \u2014 up to 6 times \u2014 than regular kerosene, and represents just 0.1% of all jet fuel in use globally, meaning its impact is currently very far from the levels needed to meet IATA\u2019s future projections. The goal of Virgin Atlantic\u2019s flight and those before it is to provide data about technical feasibility, as well as bring attention to these new sustainable fuels in a bid to scale up their production. However, according to Cat Hewitt, policy director at the Aviation Environment Federation, a UK non-profit that monitors aviation\u2019s environmental impact, the flight is more of a gimmick than a game changer. \u201cOne flight on 100% alternative fuel isn\u2019t going to change the fact that 99.9% of aviation fuel is fossil fuel and there\u2019s no great option for feedstock (raw materials) that can be scaled up sustainably,\u201d she says. Hewitt says that while advocates argue that using a fuel made from plants offsets the plane\u2019s tailpipe emissions, if the fuel is made from waste products, the carbon dioxide would have been captured regardless, \u201cSo we\u2019re not convinced there\u2019s really any carbon reduction associated with this fuel.\u201d She adds that while most SAF is currently produced from waste, the only truly sustainable option is to make a synthetic fuel produced using captured carbon combined with green hydrogen. However, Hewitt adds that these \u201ce-fuels\u201d are \u201cvery expensive and very energy intensive to produce.\u201d \u201cWe would need to hugely increase our supply of renewable energy to be able to make these fuels in meaningful quantities, and airlines would need to be prepared to pay a lot more,\u201d she says. Scaling up is also going to be a challenge, Hewitt adds, citing a report from the Royal Society, the UK\u2019s national academy of sciences, which states that producing enough biofuels to sustain domestic use would require more than half of the country\u2019s agricultural land. However, Graham Hutchings, who chaired the group that compiled that report, doesn\u2019t believe that the Virgin Atlantic flight is a gimmick. \u201cI think it\u2019s important as it raises the awareness in the public,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the short term, SAFs are likely to play a part as a \u2018drop-in\u2019 fuel that can work in existing aircraft engines while other technologies develop. But industry, regulators and legislators need to ensure that their environmental impacts are fully accounted for.\u201d Matteo Mirolo, SAF lead at the European Federation for Transport and Environment, which bills itself as Europe\u2019s leading clean transport campaign, agrees that the focus should be on synthetic fuels and advanced biofuels, which have greater potential than current waste-derived ones. \u201cSAF is not a single thing, but an umbrella term for lots of different ways of making jet fuel,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of them can reduce aviation\u2019s climate impact, whilst others can be a cure worse than the disease.\u201d Hewitt added: \u201cUntil we have genuinely zero-emission technology available for flying, there\u2019s really one thing that we know definitely works to cut aviation emissions \u2014 and that\u2019s to fly less.\u201d",

            "text": "Jack Ma has put off plans to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Alibaba shares after the Chinese tech giant\u2019s stock plummeted last week. Two regulatory filings from last Thursday revealed that Ma had been looking to offload 10 million shares, worth nearly $871 million. But because the company\u2019s stock price has fallen below the billionaire\u2019s expectations, he has not sold \u201ca single share,\u201d according to a Wednesday post from Alibaba (BABA) Chief People Officer Jane Jiang Fang on the company\u2019s internal forum seen by CNN. The sales were initially planned to take place this Tuesday through JC Properties and JSP Investment, two entities linked to Ma and his philanthropic foundation, according to the filings. The disclosure of the intended sales came the same day Alibaba reported third quarter earnings, when it announced that it would drop plans to spin off its cloud computing arm partly due to uncertainties caused by US\u00a0controls on chip exports\u00a0to China. Alibaba\u2019s stock plunged 9% in New York on Thursday and nearly 10% in Hong Kong on Friday, wiping out about $20 billion from the company\u2019s market value. So far this year, Alibaba\u2019s shares have fallen more than 10%. Jiang said the fact that both pieces of news came at the same time was just a \u201ccoincidence.\u201d The news of the sale had triggered rumors that Ma had lost confidence in the company, but Jiang urged employees to dismiss such speculation. The executive said the transactions were part of a long-term plan laid out in August, which would allow Ma\u2019s office to invest in agricultural technology and welfare projects both in and outside China. Ma believes that the Hangzhou-based firm\u2019s stock \u201cis currently significantly lower than Alibaba\u2019s actual value, and he will not sell it,\u201d she said. Alibaba Chairman Joe Tsai also weighed in, writing in a comment on the same post seen by CNN that he had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in\u00a0the company. On Friday, Ma\u2019s office told the South China Morning Post, the Hong Kong newspaper owned by Alibaba, that he remained \u201cvery positive\u201d about the company\u2019s prospects, despite plans for \u201ca partial sell-down.\u201d Ma\u2019s foundation and Alibaba did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the matter, or whether the share sale would proceed if the company\u2019s stock price rebounded. The group is currently in the midst of a major restructuring, which was announced in March and originally intended to result in a split of six separate units, each overseen by its own chief executive and board of directors. But last week, Alibaba said it would rethink plans not just for its cloud business, but for a listing of its grocery chain Freshippo, citing a need to \u201cevaluate market conditions.\u201d Ma founded Alibaba in 1999. He stepped down as chairman of the company in 2019, about a year before landing in hot water with Chinese authorities for criticizing Chinese financial regulators and banks. Since then, the entrepreneur has kept a relatively low profile while remaining an Alibaba shareholder.",

            "text": "SpaceX\u2019s gargantuan deep-space rocket system, Starship, safely lifted off Saturday morning but ended prematurely with an explosion and a loss of signal. The Super Heavy booster and Starship spacecraft successfully separated after liftoff, as the Starship lit up its engines and pushed away. That process ended up destroying the Super Heavy booster, which erupted into a ball of flames over the Gulf of Mexico. But the Starship spacecraft was able to briefly continue its journey. The Starship system made it much farther into flight than the first attempt in April. The rocket and spacecraft lifted off the launchpad at 8 a.m. ET, with the Super Heavy booster igniting all 33 of its Raptor engines. Even during ground tests, SpaceX has had a hard time getting all of those engines, clustered together at the base of the rocket, to power on consistently at the same time. The Starship upper stage had begun its trip Saturday morning strapped to the top of the Super Heavy first stage, a 232-foot-tall (70.7-meter-tall) rocket. About two and a half minutes after roaring to life and vaulting off the launchpad, the Super Heavy booster expended most of its fuel, and the Starship spacecraft fired its own engines and broke away. The Starship spacecraft used its own six engines to continue propelling itself to faster speeds. SpaceX aimed to send the spacecraft to near orbital velocities, typically around 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 kilometers per hour). Starship climbed to an altitude of about 93 miles (150 kilometers) above the Earth\u2019s surface, reaching the edge of space. The US government considers 50 miles (80 kilometers) above Earth\u2019s surface the edge of outer space. Internationally, the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, located 62 miles (100 kilometers) above sea level, is often used to mark the boundary between our planet and space \u2014 but there\u2019s a lot of\u00a0gray area. The SpaceX team awaited acquisition of signal from the spacecraft, but shared during the livestream that the \u201csecond stage was lost.\u201d \u201cThe automated flight termination system on second stage appears to have triggered very late in the burn as we were headed down range out over the Gulf of Mexico,\u201d aerospace engineer John Insprucker said. The flight termination system is essentially a self-destruct feature that SpaceX engaged to prevent the Starship from traveling off course. \u201cThe booster experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly shortly after stage separation while Starship\u2019s engines fired for several minutes on its way to space,\u201d SpaceX shared on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cWith a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today\u2019s test will help us improve Starship\u2019s reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multiplanetary.\u201d The Federal Aviation Administration, which licensed the Starship\u2019s test flight today, issued a statement after the test flight. \u201cA mishap occurred during the SpaceX Starship OFT-2 launch from Boca Chica, Texas, on Saturday, Nov. 18. The anomaly resulted in a loss of the vehicle. No injuries or public property damage have been reported,\u201d according to an FAA spokesperson. The agency will conduct a mishap investigation to determine the root cause of the loss of Starship, which is standard procedure. \u201cA return to flight of the Starship Super Heavy vehicle is based on the FAA determining that any system, process, or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety,\u201d according to the FAA. It took more than four months for the FAA to complete the last mishap investigation after Starship\u2019s test flight in April. Starship goals NASA is investing up to $4 billion in the rocket system with the goal of using the Starship capsule to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface for its Artemis III mission, currently slated to take off as soon as 2025. The endeavor is aiming to return humans to the moon for the first time in five decades, and the successful completion of this test flight would have brought the US space agency and SpaceX one step closer to that goal. \u201cCongrats to the teams who made progress on today\u2019s flight test,\u201d NASA Administrator Bill Nelson shared on X. \u201cSpaceflight is a bold adventure demanding a can-do spirit and daring innovation. Today\u2019s test is an opportunity to learn \u2014 then fly again. Together @NASA and @SpaceX will return humanity to the Moon, Mars & beyond.\u201d \u201cEach test represents a step closer to putting the first woman on the Moon with the #Artemis III Starship human landing system. Looking forward to seeing what can be learned from this test that moves us closer to the next milestone,\u201d Jim Free, NASA associate administrator for exploration systems development, shared on X. The failure could spell significant delays for Starship\u2019s development and the key missions lined up on its manifest, most notably NASA\u2019s Artemis III mission. The US space agency tapped Starship in 2021 to serve as the lunar lander for that mission. \u2018Hot staging\u2019 process The root cause of the Starship rocket\u2019s failure on Saturday was not immediately clear. But the booster explosion occurred after a phase called \u201chot staging\u201d that SpaceX tried for the first time Saturday. The method was used to separate the Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket after liftoff. Almost all rockets go through a process during launch called \u201cstage separation,\u201d in which the bottommost rocket booster diverges from the rest of the rocket or spacecraft. When SpaceX launches its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, for example, the first-stage booster \u2014 or the bottommost portion of the rocket \u2014 breaks away from the upper part of the rocket less than three minutes into flight. The Falcon 9 does so using\u00a0pneumatic pushers that are housed within the rocket\u2019s interstage, or black band around the center. Instead, the Starship spacecraft fired up its own engines to push itself away from the Super Heavy booster \u2014 and it\u2019s essentially separation by blunt force trauma. It marked a crucial moment for SpaceX, as hot staging was expected to be \u201cthe riskiest part of the flight,\u201d SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said in October. SpaceX had already said it would consider the mission a success if Starship made it past hot staging. But after hot staging, the Super Heavy booster began tumbling out of control and exploded over the Gulf of Mexico just moments later. SpaceX had hoped to reignite the Super Heavy\u2019s engines and guide it to a controlled landing. \u201cWe did know that hot staging was going to be incredibly dynamic,\u201d said Kate Tice, senior manager of SpaceX\u00a0Quality Systems Engineering, during the livestream. We knew that there was a chance that the booster would not survive, but we\u2019re going to take that data and figure out how we can make the booster better for the next hot stage.\u201d Initially, the Starship spacecraft continued moving along after separation. About eight minutes after liftoff, cheers could be heard echoing throughout mission control as the Starship was approaching the end of its engine burn \u2014 putting it on a path toward Earth\u2019s orbit. But nine minutes after launch, SpaceX made it clear that it lost video signal with Starship. And about 11.5 minutes into the flight, the company confirmed it had lost data, indicating Starship wasn\u2019t flying as planned. Then, the spacecraft\u2019s flight termination system was triggered to prevent it from veering off course, bringing an early end to the test flight. If all had gone according to plan, Starship would have continued accelerating toward space. The Starship spacecraft was then slated to complete nearly one full lap of Earth, aiming to splash down in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. The destruction of the vehicle shortly after liftoff was reminiscent of the Starship\u2019s first launch attempt in April. During that test flight, several of the Super Heavy\u2019s engines unexpectedly powered off and the rocket began spiraling out of control just minutes after liftoff. SpaceX was forced to trigger the system\u2019s self-destruct feature, blowing up both stages over the Gulf of Mexico. SpaceX took several months to recover from the April mishap. The company was forced to rebuild its launch site, which had been torn to pieces by the sheer force of the rocket powering its engines. The company also implemented upgrades to both the Starship spacecraft and the Super Heavy booster. SpaceX typically embraces fiery mishaps in the early stages of rocket development. The company has long maintained that it can learn how to build a better rocket more quickly and cheaply by flying \u2014 and occasionally exploding \u2014 early prototypes rather than relying solely on ground testing and computer modeling. After April\u2019s explosive first test flight, SpaceX noted \u201csuccess comes from what we learn, and we learned a tremendous amount.\u201d",

            "text": "There are\u00a0short runways, bumpy runways and runways that are notoriously buffeted by crosswinds, but here\u2019s a new one for nervous flyers to get alarmed about: an ice runway. Norse Atlantic Airways landed a Boeing 787 Dreamliner in rather different conditions than usual on Wednesday. The destination:\u00a0Antarctica. The landing strip: a \u201cblue ice runway\u201d 3,000 meters (9840 feet) long and 60 meters (100 feet) wide, sculpted from the snow and ice. The Dreamliner landed at Troll Airfield on Wednesday just after 2 a.m. \u2013 in bright sunlight, since it\u2019s summer in the southern hemisphere at the moment. It\u2019s the first time a Dreamliner \u2013 a widebody aircraft which can carry up to 330 passengers, depending on the model \u2013 has made it to the sixth continent. But before you start looking to book your own flight to Troll, know that flight N0787 was no regular passenger route. The 45 passengers included scientists from the Norwegian Polar Institute, which had contracted the flight to take them and 12 tons of equipment to the Troll research station in Queen Maud Land, Antarctica. It was no quick hop across the ocean, either. The plane departed Oslo on November 13, stopping in Cape Town before heading further south on Wednesday night to make its record-breaking landing. The Dreamliner\u2019s ample cargo space made it the ideal aircraft for the flight, said Daniel Carey of Aircontact, the broker which arranged the flight. Its fuel efficiency was also a factor, said Paul Erlandsson, field service representative at Boeing. The aircraft made it to Antarctica and back to Cape Town without needing to refuel. \u201cIt is a great honor and excitement on behalf of the entire team Norse that we have achieved together a momentous moment of landing the first 787 Dreamliner,\u201d Norse Atlantic Airways CEO, Bj\u00f8rn Tore Larsen, said in a statement. \u201cIn the spirit of exploration, we are proud to have a hand in this important and unique mission. It is a true testament to our highly trained and skilled pilots and crew, and our state-of-the-art Boeing aircraft.\u201d Camilla Brekke, the Norwegian Polar Institute director, said that using the larger aircraft was a more sustainable way or reaching the famously fragile continent. \u201c\u201dThe most crucial aspect is the environmental gain we can achieve by using large and modern aircraft\u2026 [which] can help reduce overall emissions and the environmental footprint in Antarctica,\u201d she said. \u201cLanding such a large aircraft opens up entirely new possibilities for logistics at Troll, which will also contribute to strengthening Norwegian research in Antarctica.\u201d",

            "text": "Alibaba has dropped plans to spin off its cloud computing arm, sending its stock tumbling, because of US controls on chip exports to China which the company said had created \u201cuncertainties\u201d for the division\u2019s prospects. The announcement came only hours after crucial talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden appeared to put the often rocky relationship between the world\u2019s top two economies on a steadier footing. In a statement Thursday, Alibaba (BABA) said the new US restrictions \u201cmay materially and adversely\u201d affect the ability of Cloud Intelligence Group to operate, impacting on profitability and casting doubt over the value of a separate listing for shareholders. Alibaba\u2019s shares fell nearly 10% in Hong Kong on Friday, wiping about $20 billion off the company\u2019s market value. \u201cWe will focus on developing a sustainable growth model for Cloud Intelligence Group under the fluid circumstances,\u201d the company said. \u201cThese new restrictions may also affect our businesses more generally by limiting our ability to upgrade our technological capabilities.\u201d Alibaba, which reiterated as recently as September that it planned to list its cloud unit as a separate company, has been forced into the rethink by the escalating chip war between the United States and China. The two countries have been locked in a year-long feud over China\u2019s access to the most advanced semiconductors, as well as the materials and equipment needed to create the components, used in products ranging from smart phones and medical equipment to electric vehicles. Last month, the US government further tightened a sweeping set of export controls first introduced a year ago, effectively reducing the range of semiconductors that American companies are able to sell to China. During talks with Biden Wednesday, Xi described the restrictions as \u201ctechnological containment,\u201d according to a senior US official. Biden said in response that the United States is not going to provide technology to China that could be used against it by the Chinese military. China, for its part, has imposed its own curbs. In August, it limited exports of gallium and germanium, two elements essential to making semiconductors. And days after the announcement of the latest US chip restrictions, Beijing unveiled plans\u00a0to restrict exports of graphite, a mineral required to make batteries for electric vehicles. In contrast, far friendlier relations between the two countries were on display this week. Biden called Wednesday\u2019s talks between the leaders \u201csome of the most constructive and productive discussions we\u2019ve had,\u201d saying he and Xi had agreed to pick up the phone and talk during periods of disagreement. Xi also met with American business leaders in San Francisco Wednesday, telling an audience that included Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk that China is willing to be \u201ca partner and a friend.\u201d He said China and the United States should not engage in a zero-sum game, in which one wins at the expense of the other. \u201cWe need to build more bridges and pave more roads for people-to-people exchanges, instead of erecting various obstacles and creating a chilling effect,\u201d Xi said. His comments came amid a slump in foreign investment in China, which is also grappling with a deepening property crisis and weak consumer spending. Alibaba, which was founded by billionaire Jack Ma 25 years ago, is in the midst of a historic overhaul that was originally meant to create six separate units, each overseen by its own chief executive and board. The group said Thursday that it is also pausing plans to list its supermarket chain Freshippo, to \u201cevaluate market conditions.\u201d But it confirmed plans for an IPO of its logistics arm, Cainiao, in Hong Kong, without providing a date for the listing. Alibaba\u2019s revenues for the June-to-September quarter climbed 9% on the previous year to 224.8 billion renminbi ($31 billion). Net profit was 26.7 billion renminbi ($3.7 billion), compared with a net loss previously, due to an increase in the value of the group\u2019s equity investments.",

            "text": "Imagine boarding a plane and stepping into a \u201ccocoon-like\u201d private bedroom fitted with a king-size bed, and a bathroom featuring the largest rain and massage shower ever built on an aircraft, which can merge with the sleeping quarters to form a self-contained retreat, providing total privacy. That\u2019s the centerpiece of Lufthansa Technik\u2019s new cabin design for the upcoming BBJ 777-9 \u2014 the private jet version of Boeing\u2019s new widebody aircraft, the 777X. Called CelestialSTAR, the design takes full advantage of the plane\u2019s extremely spacious cabin, which offers 343 square meters (about 3,700 square feet) of space and pairs with the aircraft\u2019s ability to stay in the air for 22 hours \u2014 which means it could connect any two cities in the world without stopovers, according to Boeing. But with the combined price of the plane plus the custom interior easily exceeding half a billion dollars, this will be a luxury for the very few. Lufthansa Technik, which is the engineering and maintenance arm of Germany\u2019s flag carrier, says that the concept, which was unveiled this week at the Dubai Airshow, primarily targets customers from royal families in the Middle East. That\u2019s why the design incorporates traditional patterns and influences from the region\u2019s cultural heritage. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination between a Middle Eastern touch and a very modern, sleek design,\u201d says Hassan Gasim, a sales director at Lufthansa Technik. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of the old and the new world and this region is famous for that \u2014 it values the traditions of the past, but is also very confident about the future.\u201d Other features include a \u201cwork & balance\u201d area next to the bedroom and bathroom, fitted with rotating and sliding seats, which passengers can use around large desks but can also turn and move towards the divans off to the side for conversations and meetings. The room comes with \u201ctrapezoidal wall niches,\u201d which can be used as displays or exhibits, and then closed to become invisible within the wall structure. The large dining area, Lufthansa says, functions as a \u201cmajlis\u201d \u2014 the traditional Middle Eastern gathering and meeting room \u2014 and offers 11 individual seats and features such as monitors that can be fully retracted into the table. The second half of the cabin has six deluxe suites for guests or a delegation, and there are 32 additional seats in the executive area, equivalent to business class seating. At the back end of the fuselage there\u2019s still space for an Entourage Area, similar to a premium economy cabin. Delayed giant The long-awaited 777X, the world\u2019s largest twin-engine jet, is expected to enter service in 2025, so this concept exists purely on paper for now. But Lufthansa, which will be among the first airlines to operate the type, says the concept is based on the aircraft\u2019s actual specifications, which means it can become a reality should a customer place an order for it. Gasim says Lufthansa Technik has fitted out over 150 Boeing BBJs of various models, but because of confidentiality agreements, it\u2019s never been able to show the work publicly. \u201cSo that\u2019s why we\u2019ve come up with those conceptual designs, to show what is actually possible and have a base for discussion,\u201d he says. At the Dubai Airshow, potential customers and curious attendees could experience the designs in virtual reality. For the real thing, the wait is a bit longer. \u201cIt takes quite a while to actually put such an aircraft together,\u201d says Clemens Schrettl, also a sales director at Lufthansa Technik, \u201cSo I would say the first ones will be delivered to customers in 2027 or 2028.\u201d According to Schrettl, the business jet version of the 777X will be in high demand in the GCC area, which comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. He says there are more than 30 747s in the region flying as private jets, adding, \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be even more than that for the 777X.\u201d The cost to fit one out with the CelestialSTAR cabin will be between $130 and $160 million, he says, plus the price of the aircraft itself, which is about $450 million. More than private jets The Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) range was developed in the late 1990s to produce dedicated corporate jets based on the Boeing 737, explains Gary Crichlow, an aviation analyst at consulting firm AviationValues. \u201cBoeing then began offering a BBJ variant across all of its models, including widebodies,\u201d he says. \u201cThe BBJ line is primarily aimed at ultra-high net worth individuals and heads of state.\u201d Information on buyers and sale prices is rarely disclosed, for privacy reasons, he adds. \u201cThe completion price is purely down to the imagination and budget of the customer,\u201d says Crichlow. \u201cIt\u2019s a specialist project in and of itself. Once the design is finalized, the actual fitout of the interior is not done by Boeing; after delivery of the aircraft, it is ferried to one of several specialist completion centers that are licensed to carry out the work.\u201d Boeing has produced over 250 BBJs to date, and currently offers models based on the 737 MAX, the 787 and the upcoming 777X. The vast majority of the BBJ fleet is made up of narrowbody aircraft, according to Syed Zaidi, a consultant at aviation analytics firm Cirium. The widebody BBJ family is very limited, Zaidi adds, with around 20 aircraft in service and nearly all of them in a national government or head of state role. They also come with high environmental costs, as private jets emit 10 times more pollutants than commercial planes per passenger. The Boeing 777X was one of the stars of the Dubai Airshow, where it performed a flight demonstration. Among the biggest deals at the airshow, the Emirates airline, which had already ordered 105 777Xs prior to the event, signed up for an additional 90, bringing its total to 205. It also ordered another 35 787s, and 15 Airbus A350s.",

            "text": "After months of rebuilding and clearing red tape following the April explosion of the Starship system\u2019s first test flight, SpaceX is set for its next attempt. The megarocket \u2014 the most powerful launch vehicle ever built \u2014\u00a0was expected to lift off on Friday, but SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said in a social media post Thursday that the company would hold off until Saturday to allow for time to replace a small rocket part. The company is targeting a 20-minute launch window that opens Saturday at 7 a.m. CT (8 a.m. ET), according to the SpaceX website. Musk shared that the reason for the delay was the need to replace an actuator \u2014 or a mechanical component that allows movement \u2014 on one of the rocket\u2019s grid fins. Grid fins are metal, mesh squares that line the top of Starship\u2019s Super Heavy rocket booster, and they\u2019re used to orient the booster as it heads in for a landing after flight. Riding on Starship\u2019s eventual success is the company\u2019s hopes for human exploration of the moon and Mars. The Starship spacecraft stacked atop the Super Heavy booster is intended to play a key role in the NASA Artemis III moon mission, currently slated for 2025. How the launch attempt fares could have a deep impact on the US space agency\u2019s lunar exploration goals. SpaceX will carry a live stream of the launch from the company\u2019s Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas. CNN will also provide live updates. The inaugural integrated test flight of Starship and Super Heavy in April ended just minutes after takeoff when the vehicle began tumbling tail-over-head, forcing SpaceX to initiate self-destruct mode and explode both rocket stages over the Gulf. Debris rained down over parts of the South Texas landscape, sparking outcry among environmental and wildlife groups. Local officials are expected to keep people far away from the launch site, recommending a viewing location about 5 miles (8 kilometers) across the water on Texas\u2019 South Padre Island. What to expect Standing at 397 feet (121 meters) tall, the gargantuan rocket consists of two parts: the upper spacecraft, referred to as Starship, and the lower first-stage booster, called Super Heavy, that gives the initial burst of power at liftoff. If all goes according to plan, the Super Heavy will ignite up to 33 of its massive engines and vault the Starship capsule out over the Gulf of Mexico. After its fuel is spent, the Super Heavy will detach from the Starship spacecraft and fall back toward the ocean. Starship will then ignite its own engines and attempt to propel itself to speeds quick enough to enter Earth\u2019s orbit, a feat that typically requires spacecraft to travel about 5 miles (8 kilometers) per second. \u201cTechnically it\u2019s a scooch below orbit because it\u2019s going to do almost a complete circuit of the Earth but then splash down somewhere in the Pacific just off the coast of Hawaii,\u201d said Musk, referring to the upcoming flight test, on October 5 during the International Astronautical Congress in Baku, Azerbaijian. All told, the mission will likely last about an hour and a half. Musk\u2019s Starship hopes and what\u2019s at stake If successful, the test flight will be considered a monumental step, queuing up SpaceX to begin testing far more complex Starship missions, including delivering satellites to orbit and attempting to refuel the spacecraft while it\u2019s in orbit. Being able to top off the ship\u2019s fuel in space could allow it to complete missions deeper into the cosmos. If the test mission fails, the consequences will have a ripple effect, potentially pushing back deadlines for SpaceX\u2019s \u2014 and NASA\u2019s \u2014 stated goals for the rocket system. SpaceX has framed Starship as the rocket that will fulfill the company\u2019s founding purpose: Put humans on Mars for the first time and pave the way for a permanent Martian settlement. Musk has said he thinks the first test flight to Mars could take place within the next \u201cthree or four years,\u201d though he\u2019s known for offering overly optimistic time frames. Perhaps closer on the horizon is the mission that NASA is hoping Starship will help fulfill. The space agency intends to land humans on the moon \u2014 returning US astronauts there for the first time in five decades \u2014 as part of its Artemis program. And Starship is slated to complete the final leg of the journey, taking the astronauts from their spacecraft in lunar orbit and ferrying them down to the moon\u2019s surface. SpaceX received a $2.89 billion contract from NASA in 2021 to get the job done, with another deal worth up to $1.15 billion awarded a year later. The company will receive payments as it completes certain milestones in Starship\u2019s development. NASA hopes the first moon landing using Starship will take place as soon as late 2025. \u201cWith the difficulties that SpaceX has had, I think that\u2019s really concerning,\u201d said Jim Free, associate administrator of NASA\u2019s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, in June. \u201cYou can think about that launch date slipping probably into \u201926.\u201d The US space agency is aiming to put boots on the moon sooner rather than later, as it\u2019s racing against China to create the first permanent lunar base. What success looks like for SpaceX High hopes aside, SpaceX has been known to embrace fiery mishaps and explosions in the early stages of developing a new rocket. SpaceX has said its approach to rocket development is geared toward speed. The company makes use of an engineering method called \u201crapid spiral development.\u201d That essentially boils down to a desire to quickly build prototypes and willingly blow them up in the name of learning how to construct a better one \u2014 faster than if the company solely relied on ground tests and simulations. After the first test flight\u2019s explosion, the company immediately sought to frame the mishap as a success, saying in a statement at the time, \u201cWith a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and we learned a tremendous amount.\u201d Previous explosions have grounded a rocket for a year or more. But SpaceX quickly developed a new prototype, implemented \u201cthousands\u201d of upgrades, and was ready to fly another test vehicle in early September, according to updates shared by Musk on social media. Musk has said that the company has made enhancements\u00a0to both the Starship spacecraft and the Super Heavy booster design to incorporate lessons learned from the first launch. The launchpad, for example, was blown to bits after the inaugural launch because of the sheer force of the Super Heavy booster\u2019s engines. SpaceX has since equipped the pad with a water deluge system that will spew water up as the engines ignite, dampening their blast and hopefully sparing the pad. Musk has likened the contraption to a colossal showerhead. SpaceX is also changing the method Starship will use to break away from the Super Heavy booster midflight, opting to use the Starship\u2019s own engines to push away, rather than a separate mechanical system. It\u2019s not clear whether all those changes will lead to success. \u201cI do want to set expectations, well, not too high,\u201d Musk said at the October conference when asked about his goals for this test mission. Musk also posted in August on social media that he foresees about a \u201c50% probability of reaching orbital velocity,\u201d though he cautiously added that \u201ceven getting to stage separation would be a win,\u201d referring to the launch phase when the Super Heavy rocket detaches from the Starship spacecraft. Those are still better odds than Musk gave the April test flight, which he had said would have been a success if the rocket made it off the launchpad. Regulators and environmentalists Starship couldn\u2019t fly when SpaceX first claimed it was ready in September due to regulatory hurdles. The company was still waiting on the Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, to close an investigation into the explosive April test flight and issue a new launch license. William Gerstenmaier \u2014 SpaceX\u2019s vice president for build and reliability who previously served as NASA\u2019s associate administrator for human exploration \u2014 blasted the regulatory process during an October US Senate hearing, accusing them of hamstringing Starship\u2019s development. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame when our hardware is ready to fly, and we\u2019re not able to go fly because of regulations or review,\u201d Gerstenmaier said. \u201cThese delays may seem small in the big scheme of things but \u2026 delays in each and every test flight adds up. And eventually we will lose our lead and we will see China land on the moon before we do.\u201d On the other end of the spectrum, however, are environmentalists, who say the FAA isn\u2019t doing nearly enough to ensure the company is not damaging the public lands and wildlife refuges that surround SpaceX\u2019s South Texas launch site. One group of activists sued the FAA in May, alleging regulators had failed to comply with federal environmental law when they greenlit Starship\u2019s April test flight.\u00a0That case is ongoing, and the FAA could face another complaint over the second launch license, which was issued Wednesday by the federal agency, a senior attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, Jared Margolis, told CNN November 8. The environmental groups have protested SpaceX testing operations, saying its explosive mishaps have spewed shrapnel onto public beaches and into the nearby wildlife reserves, in addition to burning acres of land with unintended brush fires. SpaceX, which is involved in the case as an intervener, denied many of the allegations in the lawsuit but admitted its testing operations have flung debris into nearby areas. But both SpaceX and the FAA maintain that they have complied with federal environmental laws. In a written reevaluation of its environmental assessment signed by the FAA on Wednesday, the agency noted that SpaceX made changes at the launchpad that could reduce the amount of debris generated by the next test flight. The agency also concluded, \u201cNew information from the first launch and ongoing monitoring does not present any significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns.\u201d SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment for this story, nor does the company typically respond to inquiries from reporters.",

            "text": "Tencent rushed to build up \u201cone of the largest inventories of AI chips in China\u201d before US export restrictions took hold, an executive said Wednesday. Martin Lau, president of the Chinese tech giant, told analysts on an earnings call that it had purchased components from Nvidia (NVDA) early, allowing it to keep developing its generative AI model for at least \u201ca couple of generations.\u201d \u201cOne of the key things that we have done was actually we were the first to put in orders for [the] H800, and that allows us to have a pretty good inventory,\u201d Lau said. He added that Tencent was now scouting new suppliers within China \u201cfor these training chips.\u201d Lau did not specify when the purchase took place, but the H800 is among the products restricted from sale to China due to US export curbs announced last month, Nvidia\u00a0said\u00a0in October regulatory filings. It is one of the chipmaker\u2019s advanced AI chips designed for use in data centers, the physical facilities used to store troves of electronic information. In late October, Nvidia disclosed that the just-announced restrictions had come into effect \u201cimmediately,\u201d weeks earlier than scheduled. Over the past year, the United States and China have progressively escalated a feud over access to the most advanced semiconductors, as well as the materials and equipment needed to create the technology. Washington\u2019s decision to reduce the types of semiconductors that American companies can sell to China last month further tightened a set of export controls first introduced in October 2022 on national security grounds. The Biden administration deems the latest measures necessary to prevent potential use of the hardware for China\u2019s military advancement and to close loopholes in existing regulations. In response, Beijing has accused Washington of \u201cweaponizing trade and tech issues.\u201d The standoff has led other Chinese firms to build up their chip supplies. This month, one of China\u2019s most prominent tech investors, Kai-Fu Lee, told Bloomberg that his new Beijing-based startup, 01.AI, had also stockpiled chips it needed for the near future.   The company began assembling its reserve of chips earlier this year, even using borrowed funds from Lee\u2019s venture firm Sinovation Ventures, because \u201cwe felt we had to,\u201d he told the media outlet in an interview. The venture capital firm did not respond a request for comment on the matter. The practice of stockpiling is not new. In recent years, before it was slapped with crippling US trade restrictions in 2020, Chinese tech giant Huawei also \u201cstockpiled a two-year supply of chips prior to US entity restrictions taking effect,\u201d according to a report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. China\u2019s top chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), has also \u201camassed a large number of machines and potentially also a large stockpile of spare parts that it can draw from,\u201d the report said. While the US export ban currently does not \u201caffect the development of Hunyuan and our AI capability in the near future,\u201d Tencent is concerned it could affect its ability to resell components to other customers, according to Lau, referring to its AI bot. \u201cGoing forward, we will have to figure out ways to make \u2026 the usage of our AI chips more efficient,\u201d namely by working to retain most of the company\u2019s high-performance chips for training the model, he added. Hunyuan, which Tencent says is meant to denote \u201csomething that is all encompassing and without limit,\u201d was launched by the Shenzhen-based company in September. The bot was developed specifically for corporate users, allowing them to catch up on meetings by viewing automated summaries or put together documents more efficiently, Lau told analysts. The platform is currently available on a limited basis to customers and the public, according to Tencent. The company has reported solid earnings for the quarter ended September, logging a 10% jump in revenue that met analyst expectations. Sales surged to 154.6\u00a0billion yuan\u00a0($21.3 billion) compared to the same period a year ago, while profit attributable to shareholders climbed 39% to 44.9\u00a0billion yuan ($6.2\u00a0billion).",

The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, said Wednesday that SpaceX has permission to launch the mission after the agency determined it \u201cmet all safety, environmental, policy and financial responsibility requirements.\u201d SpaceX\u2019s website states that the company is targeting a two-hour launch window on Friday, November 17, that opens at 7 a.m. CT (8 a.m. ET). Public notices issued to mariners indicate that backup opportunities for liftoff could include the mornings of November 18, 19 and 20. The Starship spacecraft and its Super Heavy booster are at the center of SpaceX\u2019s plans to eventually put humans on Mars, as well as aid NASA\u2019s effort to return humans to the moon\u00a0for the first time in more than 50 years. Starship is intended to serve as the lunar lander for the Artemis III mission, currently slated for 2025. And if the test flight once again fails, it could bog down NASA\u2019s lunar exploration timeline. April\u2019s inaugural integrated test flight of Starship and Super Heavy \u2014 the massive rocket expected to propel the spacecraft to orbital speeds \u2014 ended just minutes after takeoff when the vehicle began tumbling tail-over-head, forcing SpaceX to initiate self-destruct mode and explode both rocket stages over the Gulf of Mexico. SpaceX has spent the past several months rebuilding the launch site and making upgrades to the rocket system at the company\u2019s Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas. The launchpad was torn to pieces by the sheer force of Super Heavy\u2019s engines igniting, sending debris into the surrounding coastal area. The rocket mishap\u2019s potential impacts galvanized a group of environmental and wildlife advocates to file a May lawsuit againt the FAA, claiming the agency had failed to comply with federal environmental laws when it greenlit Starship\u2019s first test flight. William Gerstenmaier, SpaceX vice president for build and reliability, faulted regulators for holding up the second test flight, saying at a mid-October US Senate hearing, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame when our hardware is ready to fly, and we\u2019re not able to go fly because of regulations or review.\u201d The FAA finished its safety investigation in September, laying out 63 corrective actions for SpaceX. The agency then completed a safety review on October 31 for SpaceX\u2019s planned second test flight. However, as part of its environmental review, the FAA set up a consultation with the US Fish and Wildlife Service under the Endangered Species Act. That process concluded on November 14, according to a statement from the agency, allowing FAA to issue the launch permit. Now, SpaceX is set for another attempt to propel Starship off the launchpad and send it on a mission to complete nearly one full lap of Earth. Starship challenges If the test mission once again fails, NASA\u2019s aim to return humans to the moon\u2019s surface could face delays as the space agency is racing other nations \u2014 including China \u2014 to build a permanent lunar settlement. The space agency has already warned that Starship might not be ready in time for a 2025 moon landing attempt. Even if successful, SpaceX still has numerous technological hurdles to clear. The company must demonstrate the rocket can safely deliver a satellite or another payload to Earth\u2019s orbit, as well as dock with a refueling tanker to top off its propellant while in orbit \u2014 a move that will be essential for getting the massive vehicle to the moon.

Environmental concerns SpaceX may also face additional pushback from environmentalists ahead of \u2014 or in the wake of \u2014 the second launch attempt. The group of environmental and wildlife advocates that previously sued the FAA could still attempt to seek an injunction to stop the next launch. When reached for comment, Jared Margolis, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said the nonprofit group had not decided whether to pursue that route, though it recognized the option was still on the table. It\u2019s not clear, however, whether the group will have enough time to file the proper paperwork before SpaceX moves forward with the anticipated launch.",

Shares of the automaker, which recently forecast that a strike by autoworkers this fall would cut pretax earnings by about $800 million this year, were down about 0.3% on Wednesday. GM holdings make up a small percentage of Berkshire\u2019s $313 billion portfolio, but the firm does appear to be lowering its position in a number of big, blue chip names. The Oracle of Omaha also sold off some of Berkshire\u2019s other holdings, including Amazon, HP, Chevron, Procter & Gamble, UPS, Mondelez International and Johnson & Johnson in the third quarter. Overall, Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks last quarter: The firm sold about $7 billion worth of stock and bought $1.7 billion. In the past year, the company has sold about $40 billion worth of stock. Still, Berkshire Hathaway did procure some shares of satellite radio company Sirius XM, buying nearly 10 million shares for a total of $50 million \u2014 or just under 1% of Sirius\u2019 total market value \u2014 in the third quarter. Shares of Sirius shot nearly 6% higher on Wednesday. Berkshire ended the quarter with a record $157 billion in cash on hand. The company had about $147 billion at the end of the second quarter and beat out its previous record of $149 billion, set in 2021. The money, which is mostly held in short-term Treasuries, has grown significantly as interest rates increase and as dealmaking on Wall Street has dried up, giving Buffett less opportunity to acquire new companies. Buffett earlier this year brushed off Fitch Ratings\u2019 downgrade of US credit from the top AAA grade to AA+, telling CNBC on August 3 that Berkshire bought $10 billion worth of US Treasuries that week after doing the same a week prior. \u201cThe only question for next Monday is whether we will buy $10 billion in 3-month or 6-month [Treasury notes],\u201d Buffett said at the time. Earlier this month, Berkshire Hathaway reported that its bets abroad have also paid off. Berkshire revealed in 2020 that it had bought stakes of about 5% in each of Japan\u2019s top five trading companies, totaling $6.7 billion in investments at the time. The company doubled down this year, taking its stakes in each company to average above 8.5%, as Japan\u2019s stock market soared to 33-year highs. \u201cIt was like having God just opening a chest and just pouring money into it,\u201d Charlie Munger, vice chair of Berkshire Hathaway, said of the investments in an interview with the Acquired podcast, released in October. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway are up about 15.8% year to date. The S&P 500, meanwhile, is up 17.4% over the same period.",

The USS Thomas Hudner, an Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer, engaged a drone that originated from Yemen on Wednesday and was heading towards the ship, a defense official confirmed to CNN. The Hudner was not believed to be the intended target, the officials said. A statement from the Defense Department on Wednesday said that while \u201ctransiting the international waters of the Red Sea, the crew of the\u00a0USS Thomas Hudner (DDG 116) engaged a drone that originated from Yemen and was heading in the direction of the ship.\u201d \u201cThe Hudner\u2019s crew engaged and shot down the drone to ensure the safety of U.S. personnel,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThere were no U.S. casualties or any damage to the ship.\u201d Reuters was first to report the drone had been shot down. The Hudner\u00a0was deployed\u00a0as part of the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group,\u00a0and was in the southern portion of the Red Sea at the time of the engagement, one of the officials said. It was the second intercept\u00a0by a\u00a0US Navy vessel in the region since Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel on October 7. On October 20, the USS Carney,\u00a0intercepted four cruise missiles and 15 drones over a nine-hour period, CNN\u00a0previously reported.\u00a0The Pentagon said the missiles were fired by Iranian-backed Houthi forces. Pentagon Press Secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said in October that those missiles were launched \u201cpotentially towards targets in Israel.\u201d The Carney intercepted the projectiles with SM-2 surface-to-air missiles. The Houthi rebels have\u00a0claimed responsibility for recent missile attacks on Israel, and said more would follow if \u201cIsraeli aggression\u201d continued. Wednesday\u2019s engagement comes a week after a US MQ-9 Reaper drone\u00a0was shot down\u00a0by Houthi forces off the cost of Yemen. It also comes amid continuous attacks by Iranian-backed forces in the region. As of Tuesday, US and coalition forces had come under attack by Iranian-backed groups in Iraq and Syria at least 56 times since October 17.",

            "text": "If this holiday season is like most others, we can expect flight delays, cancellations, lost baggage and all the miseries that come with flying. Policymakers\u00a0often\u00a0try\u00a0to address these\u00a0issues\u00a0with a \u201cpassengers\u2019 bill of rights.\u201d But they rarely seem to make a dent in improving the overall travel experience. The reason is that many of the problems in the airline industry are structural \u2014 they are\u00a0about airlines\u2019 incentives\u00a0as businesses. Airlines make money when they cut costs and increase profits, which can mean worse service for flyers. If we want to make flying less miserable, policymakers \u2014 and the traveling public \u2014 will have to tackle these incentives. To see why, a bit of history is helpful.\u00a0In the 1930s, Congress passed\u00a0a major law\u00a0regulating airlines\u00a0using\u00a0public utility principles, an approach that had long been common for transportation infrastructure. The idea\u00a0was\u00a0that the\u00a0United States should have\u00a0stable, reliable air service across the whole country \u2014 even in places\u00a0where\u00a0there wasn\u2019t a lot of demand. Under this system, a federal agency called the Civil Aeronautics Board allocated\u00a0routes\u00a0to\u00a0airlines instead of airlines choosing where they wanted to fly, and it regulated prices as well. In the process, the Board could ensure there was a measure of competition among airlines and cities. By guaranteeing the airlines a return\u00a0on top of their expenses,\u00a0rather than having airlines compete over price, the system incentivized the airlines to invest in expanding and improving services. In the middle of\u00a0the 20th century, airlines\u00a0adopted\u00a0new, cutting-edge jet technologies. By the 1970s, amid an economic crisis and depressed demand for flights, airlines shifted toward eye-popping\u00a0service\u00a0competition:\u00a0American Airlines put\u00a0piano bars\u00a0in airplanes.\u00a0Trans World Airlines\u00a0had\u00a0poker\u00a0machines.\u00a0Delta\u00a0offered steak and champagne. Regulation on prices meant that airline competition was a race to the top on service quality so airlines could attract customers. Advocates for deregulation in the 1970s were horrified by these developments. They thought air travel was not a utility-like infrastructure that needed special rules.\u00a0It was more like selling sofas or coffee mugs.\u00a0They won the political\u00a0battle,\u00a0and\u00a0Congress\u00a0deregulated\u00a0the airlines in 1978. Under the new regime, airlines could fly where they wanted (subject to airport constraints) and set their own prices.\u00a0Competition soon took on a different flavor. Busy, heavily trafficked routes attracted new upstart airlines, which undercut prices because airline workers were not unionized and offered \u201cno frills\u201d tickets. But the big\u00a0carriers eventually pushed them out, by matching or beating them on price, creating frequent flyer programs to keep passengers with the airline, and offering a much bigger network. After dozens of mergers and bankruptcies, the airline industry ultimately became less competitive. Today, the four biggest\u00a0airlines\u00a0have a larger collective\u00a0market share\u00a0than the top four did during the 1970s. Today\u2019s miseries of flying derive from this choice to deregulate airlines and unleash them into the Hunger Games of\u00a0ordinary incentives. Added fees for baggage, an increasing number of fare classes, differential\u00a0pricing \u2014 these all make perfect sense as a way to squeeze money out of passengers. Without the regulation of routes, airlines have also created hub-and-spokes systems in which passengers have to connect to big hubs like Atlanta or Dallas instead of flying nonstop to their destination. This\u00a0means less competition (and higher prices). Some cities have\u00a0lost airport volume; others have\u00a0lost service\u00a0altogether. And the shift to big hubs means that a storm or even high winds in one of those hubs can disrupt travel across the country because so many flights connect through the city. By all means, policymakers\u00a0can\u00a0continue to push for specific changes: improvements to air traffic control systems, requirements for refunds due to delays, and so on. But trying to address every problem one by one is like playing whack-a-mole. There will just be some other issue that pops up next year, or the year after. The better approach is to think bigger. Instead of\u00a0addressing each problem\u00a0piecemeal, we need structural changes that reshape incentives so airlines compete to improve services, not to squeeze passengers into smaller seats\u00a0or out of a few more bucks. In my new book,\u00a0\u201cWhy Flying is Miserable \u2014 and How to Fix It,\u201d I offer a set of principles and ideas for a new approach, one that learns from the past but doesn\u2019t return to it. A new national airline policy\u00a0should ensure access to air travel across the United States. It should adopt a no-bailouts, no-bankruptcies approach, in which we have an industry that is stable, reliable and thriving. And\u00a0it would ensure\u00a0fair, simpler and more transparent pricing\u00a0for travelers.\u00a0For example, limiting dominance at airport hubs would mean greater competition and the creation of more hubs rather than bigger hubs. Competition would be beneficial to flyers, and reducing concentration would expand access to more places. If we build a system with these principles in mind, the airlines\u2019\u00a0practices\u00a0will change, and we can fix many of the frustrations that travelers face.\u00a0We\u00a0wouldn\u2019t just have a limited bill of rights for\u00a0passengers.

            "text": "Russia\u2019s leading aircraft manufacturer says it\u2019s completed a successful test flight of a new widebody passenger airplane that it claims could replace Western aircraft in the country\u2019s skies.\u00a0 The United Aircraft Corporation said a prototype of its IL-96-400M long-haul airplane has taken off for the first time on a flight that lasted 26 minutes and reached altitudes of up to 2,000 meters (6,562 feet) and speeds of up to 390 kilometers per hour (242 mph), according to a news release posted by the company last week. UAC, which oversees Russian aviation brands including Tupolev, Ilyushin and Sukhoi, said the plane will be capable of carrying up to 370 passengers, a capacity that would put it alongside the likes of Airbus\u2019 A340 or Boeing\u2019s 777. It said the airplane marked a step up from the previous IL-96-300 aircraft, production of which reportedly halted more than a decade ago because it was unable to compete with Western models. \u201cThe first and successful flight of the modernized IL-96-400M is a demonstration of the highest level of competence of domestic aircraft manufacturers,\u201d Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister, Denis Manturov, said in the release. According to UAC, the IL-96-400M can be configured in up to three passenger classes and will be installed with a \u201cmodern infotainment system\u201d offering internet, TV and satellite communications. It will also be equipped with a \u201cmodern\u201d kitchen. The new airplane, which was photographed midair decorated in UAC corporate colors, could be seen as a public relations win for Russia at a time when its domestic aviation industry is creaking under pressure of Western sanctions imposed because of its invasion of Ukraine. US and European sanctions on leasing planes to Russia led to that country losing nearly 10% of commercial aircraft before President Vladimir Putin enacted laws allowing Russian airlines to seize leased aircraft and re-register them domestically. But with limited access to parts for planes made by Boeing, Airbus and other Western manufacturers like Bombardier and Embraer, experts say keeping fleets airworthy will be increasingly difficult. As of 2022, only 144 active Russian airline planes were built in Russia, according to data provided by aviation analytics firm Cirium. \u201cAlthough Moscow won\u2019t admit it, the sanctions that followed the Ukraine invasion have really damaged Russian aviation,\u201d Murdo Morrison, head of strategic content at FlightGlobal, tells CNN. \u2018Massive gamble\u2019 \u201cThe problem is that lack of spares \u2013 some get in through the back door undoubtedly \u2013 means that many Airbus and Boeing aircraft flying in Russia today are potentially dangerous. Although Russia has a proficient regulator, there is very little visibility as to the health of its fleet.\u201d In September, an Airbus A320 operated by Ural Airlines, reportedly one of the leased aircraft appropriated by Russia, was forced to make an emergency landing in a field in Russia\u2019s Novosibirsk region due to what was provisionally claimed to have been a midair failure of its hydraulic system. Last year, a safety audit by the International Civil Aviation Organization resulted in Russia being marked with a \u201cred flag\u201d indicating insufficient regulatory oversight \u2013 a status shared by only three other countries \u2013 Bhutan, Congo and Liberia. Addressing concerns, Russia\u2019s Ministry of Transport said at the time that flight safety on Russia-operated aircraft meets international standards. UAC\u2019s release said the new IL-96-400M\u2019s safety and reliability was comparable to the \u201cworld\u2019s best models due to the redundancy of the aircraft\u2019s systems and its aerodynamic configuration.\u201d The manufacturer also said it would meet international regulatory requirements. Yuri Slyusar, UAC\u2019s general director, was quoted in the release saying it would, alongside other Russian-built aircraft, be deployed across the country\u2019s aviation network and \u201creplace foreign analogues.\u201d FlightGlobal\u2019s Morrison says that while the aircraft may be reliable, they will be significantly inferior to their Western counterparts and are unlikely to be manufactured in the quantities once seen under Soviet rule. \u201cTrying to restore Russia\u2019s pre-1990 aerospace industry is a massive gamble. In fact, it will lose the state billions, although Moscow probably accepts that the political price is worth paying, and, besides, it hasn\u2019t any choice.\u201d",

            "text": "Blockbuster hit \u201cBarbie\u201d brought in a record $1.5 billion for Warner Bros. Discovery, but the company still reported a $417 million loss for the quarter that was bigger than Wall Street\u2019s forecasts. The company, however, reported a narrow profit when taking into account adjustments for certain items, including interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of CNN, needed the revenue boost from \u201cBarbie\u201d to achieve a narrow 2% increase in sales. The company\u2019s revenue came in at just under $2 billion for the quarter. The strong box office showing offset a $235 million drop in advertising revenue in WBD\u2019s networks unit, representing a 12% drop. The company also contended with an unspecified drop in revenue that it attributed to the strikes held by the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, the union representing 160,000 actors that halted most television and movie production for months. Although the writers strike has been settled, SAG-AFTRA remains on strike and negotiations between the union and studios and streaming services continues. The company said in September it expected a hit to earnings of up to $500 million for the full year from the strike. CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels warned investors Wednesday that \u201cthere is a real risk at this point that\u00a0some negative financial impact of the strike will\u00a0extend into 2024 to some extent.\u201d There is also a \u201cpossibility of continued sluggish advertising\u00a0trends\u201d into 2024, he said. CEO David Zaslav said the strike had \u201ccompelled\u00a0us to delay some releases\u201d and gave the company \u201cone of our lightest original content\u00a0schedules in\u00a0years\u201d in the third quarter. But the company did not give any updated dollar estimates for the cost of the strike to the company. \u201cThis\u00a0is anything but a precise science,\u201d said Wiedenfels. \u201cWe are hopeful we will reach a resolution to the SAG-AFTRA strike soon,\u201d said Zaslav, in a call with investors. \u201cWe recognize that we need our creative partners to feel valued and rewarded, and look forward to both sides getting back to the business of telling great stories.\u201d Larger loss per share than forecast The company\u2019s net loss marked an improvement from the $2.3 billion loss it reported in the same quarter a year earlier. But its loss per share of 17 cents was larger than the forecast of a 6-cent-a-share loss expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The company reported that adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) increased 22% to just under $3 billion. That measure of profits fell at both its networks and studio units, despite the strong box office from \u201cBarbie.\u201d But WBD reported another profitable quarter from its streaming services, as adjusted EBITDA swung to a $111 million profit from a $634 million loss on that basis a year ago. It reported that profit despite a 700,000 decrease in the number of subscribers compared to a year earlier, to 95.1 million worldwide. Higher subscription prices and a 29% increase in advertising revenue helped turn around results. The company had reported its first profit from streaming in the first quarter of this year, then fell back to a narrow loss from the unit in the second quarter. While Netflix is profitable, most of the streaming services operated by legacy media companies or Apple have yet to report a consistent profit. WBD shares fell by close to 16% in morning trading on the earnings miss and the warning about continued impact of the strike and a sluggish ad market in 2024.",

            "text": "Ryanair will start paying regular dividends for the first time in its nearly 40-year history, as Europe\u2019s largest airline reaps record profits off the back of booming demand for air travel and much higher ticket prices. The company, which also owns Polish airline Buzz and Austrian carrier Lauda, will return \u20ac400 million ($429.8 million) to shareholders via two equal payments next year and plans to distribute a quarter of annual profits going forward by way of ordinary dividends. The news helped send its shares nearly 7% higher Monday, taking this year\u2019s gain to 33%. Ryanair has returned money to investors in the past, but never on a regular basis. Between 2008 and 2020, the group paid out \u20ac6.74 billion ($7.2 billion) to shareholders via buybacks and ad hoc dividend payments, according to a spokesperson. \u201cInvestors have lots to be cheerful about in this set of results, including (Ryanair\u2019s) better-than-expected earnings, its outlook, and its dividend announcement,\u201d Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, an online investing platform, wrote in a note. Ryanair (RYAAY) has benefited handsomely from resurgent travel demand following the pandemic, particularly as several rival carriers collapsed or made cuts to fleets and passenger capacity. The Dublin-based airline flew 105.4 million passengers over the six months through September \u2014 an 11% increase on the same period last year, thanks to strong demand over Easter and record summer traffic. Less competition has allowed the airline to increase ticket prices, which soared 24% on average, offsetting significantly higher fuel costs. The growth in ticket prices is set to moderate \u2014 Ryanair said fares for the October-to-December quarter were likely to be ahead of their year-ago levels by a \u201cmid-teens percentage.\u201d \u201cRyanair has been able to pass on additional cost pressures to consumers\u2026 with ticket prices likely to continue to go up next year,\u201d said Scholar. That could attract increased scrutiny from regulators. The European Union\u2019s transport commissioner, Adina V\u0103lean, told the Financial Times in an interview published Monday that EU officials are probing a recent rise in air fares across Europe to determine \u201cwhat is exactly going on in the market and why.\u201d The global aviation industry has recovered rapidly from a sharp downturn during the pandemic, when it racked up net losses of $183 billion. The International Air Transport Association\u00a0said\u00a0in June that it expects airlines globally to make $9.8 billion in net profit in 2023, more than doubling the forecast it had made six months prior. New records Ryanair, for its part, continues to set new personal bests. The airline posted a record half-year profit of \u20ac2.18 billion ($2.3 billion) for the six months to September but said it expected \u201cmodest losses over the winter period.\u201d Still, it expects a full-year profit for the year to March 2024 in the range of \u20ac1.85 billion ($2 billion)\u2014\u20ac2.05 billion ($2.2 billion). That would be up from its previous record of \u20ac1.45 billion ($1.6 billion) earned in 2018, before the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWe are a very profitable airline but it\u2019s a very modest profit at \u20ac10 per passenger, given the resources and the capital that we\u2019ve invested in this business,\u201d CEO Michael O\u2019Leary said in a video posted on the company\u2019s website. Ryanair is showing few signs of slowing down, with plans to add more than 200 new routes over the next year, including its first flights to Albania this winter. But O\u2019Leary sounded a cautious note on its ambition to carry 183.5 million passengers over the 12 months ending in March 2024. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether we\u2019ll hit that number. It depends on Boeing meeting some of their delivery commitments,\u201d he said. Ryanair agreed to buy up to 300 Boeing 737-10 planes earlier this year in a deal worth $40 billion. It said Monday that up to 10 of 57 aircraft due for delivery before summer 2024 might be delayed until the following winter.",

            "text": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway on Saturday reported a surge in third-quarter operating earnings and a record-high cash pile of $157 billion. Operating income totaled $10.8 billion, up from $7.7 billion, or a 40.6% increase from a year ago. Berkshire reported a net loss of $12.8 billion, compared to a loss of $2.8 billion during the same period last year. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate saw investment losses of $23.5 billion last quarter, compared to a loss of $10.4 billion a year earlier. Berkshire\u2019s insurance underwriting business generated earnings of $2.4 billion, up from a loss of $1.1 billion during the same quarter last year. Insurance investment income increased to $2.5 billion, up from $1.4 billion from the same period a year ago. Geico, owned by Berkshire and one of the country\u2019s largest insurance companies, reported an underwriting profit of $1.053 billion \u2014 a sharp gain from a loss of $759 million during last year\u2019s third quarter. Berkshire bought back about $1.1 billion in stock during the third quarter, bringing the nine-month total to approximately $7 billion in stock repurchases so far this year. The company\u2019s cash hoard rose to $157.2 billion, up from $147.4 in the second quarter of this year. Buffett earlier this year brushed off Fitch Ratings\u2019 downgrade of US credit from the top AAA grade to AA+, telling CNBC on August 3 that Berkshire bought $10 billion worth of US Treasuries that week after doing the same a week prior. \u201cThe only question for next Monday is whether we will buy $10 billion in 3-month or 6-month [Treasury notes],\u201d Buffett said at the time. Treasury yields topped levels not seen in over a decade in October, before retreating last week after the Federal Reserve held rates steady for a second consecutive time. US stocks have rallied this year on artificial intelligence hype and hopes that the Fed will soon stop hiking interest rates, helping Berkshire\u2019s turnaround from last year\u2019s rout when the market nosedived. The company\u2019s bets abroad have also paid off. Berkshire revealed in 2020 that it had bought stakes of about 5% in each of Japan\u2019s top five trading companies, totaling $6.7 billion in investments at the time. The company doubled down this year, taking its stakes in each company to average above 8.5%, as Japan\u2019s stock market soared to 33-year highs. \u201cIt was like having God just opening a chest and just pouring money into it,\u201d Charlie Munger, vice chair of Berkshire Hathaway, said of the investments in an interview with the Acquired podcast released in October. Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares are up 13.9% for the year as of Friday\u2019s close, underperforming the benchmark S&P 500.",

            "text": "Passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight where an off-duty pilot attempted to cut off the engines felt the plane dramatically pitch forward, as if it were in a nosedive, according to a newly-filed lawsuit. The lawsuit, filed by three passengers against Alaska Airlines and Horizon Airlines, the operator of flight 2059, claims the airlines did not properly evaluate off-duty pilot Joseph Emerson before he was seated in an extra cockpit seat \u2013 the jump seat \u2013 on the October 22 flight. \u201cHad they done so, he more likely than not would have been denied admission and could not have been in position to nearly kill everyone aboard,\u201d the lawsuit claims. Alaska Airlines has said its ground and air crews had observed no \u201csigns of impairment that would have led them to prevent Emerson from flying.\u201d It said Friday it is reviewing the lawsuit, and applauded the crew\u2019s actions. \u201cThe pilots and flight attendants operating Flight 2059 responded without hesitation to ensure the safety of all onboard,\u201d Alaska Airlines said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cWe are incredibly proud and grateful for their skilled actions.\u201d Emerson is accused of attempting to kill everyone on board when he tried to activate a fire extinguisher system that shuts down the fuel lines to the engines.\u00a0After the incident, Emerson told police he experienced a nervous breakdown, had been depressed and recently used magic mushrooms. He is being held without bail at the Multnomah County Jail in Portland, Oregon. He has been charged in federal court with interfering with a flight crew, the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Oregon has announced. Emerson also faces dozens of state charges in Oregon, including 83 felony counts of attempted murder, 83 counts of reckless endangerment and one count of endangering an aircraft, booking records show. He has pleaded not guilty to all state charges. Before the lawsuit was filed, Emerson\u2019s attorney, Noah Horst, told CNN Emerson \u201cwould never intentionally hurt another person\u201d and was not \u201cunder the influence of any intoxicants\u201d on the flight. The lawsuit reveals new details about what passengers experienced onboard the plane. \u201cPassengers on the plane had been experiencing a normal flight for 45 minutes to 1 hour, when the plane suddenly experienced what felt like a nosedive,\u201d the suit says.\u00a0\u201cA flight attendant on the intercom announced to the passengers of the plane needed to land immediately. The surprised Plaintiffs were left in the dark about what was happening\u201d \u201cThoughts of a complete plane malfunction or terrorist activity naturally entered their minds,\u201d the lawsuit says. Passengers then observed Emerson exit the cockpit, walk to the back of the plane and attempt to open a plane door, the lawsuit says. Some passengers, the lawsuit says, learned about what was happening through friends on the ground who looked at aviation tracking websites. Despite a long list of incidents where pilots have successfully commandeered aircraft \u2013 a list enumerated in the court filing \u2013 the lawsuit claims Alaska Airlines did not properly evaluate Emerson\u2019s fitness to ride in the cockpit jump seat. The lawsuit says the passengers\u2019 damages include emotional distress and asks the court to consider the matter a class-action lawsuit.\u00a0It does not list a dollar amount for the alleged damages but does ask the court to order Alaska Airlines and Horizon to better screen crew members prior to flights.",

            "title": "The new breed of long-haul, low-cost airlines: What you need to know",
            "text": "You\u2019ve seen them on TikTok and on Instagram: people flying on the new generation of long-haul, low-cost airlines where the fares sound too good to be true. Flights from New York to Paris for $200? They\u2019re out there, if you\u2019re able to be flexible, and if you\u2019re willing to skip extras \u2014\u00a0depending on the airline, that could include checked bags, meals, entertainment and the bar cart. But what\u2019s different on each of these independent airlines? Let\u2019s break it down. Comparing long-haul, low-cost carriers to other airlines that bill themselves as \u201cfull-service,\u201d you\u2019ll often get the same newer planes like the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, sometimes with the same seats and entertainment screens. To an extent, airline food is airline food, and many folks already pack their own meals even on full-service airlines. These carriers can be a great deal if you go into them with the understanding that you\u2019re paying low-cost fares, so you should expect a low-cost experience onboard. Overall,\u00a0set your expectations low, remember how little you paid, and then you might be pleasantly surprised. By and large, long-haul, low-cost airlines focus on four specific markets: transatlantic, transpacific, southeast Asia and Australia. That\u2019s where the flights are long enough to be long-haul, but where passengers are numerous enough for the airline to make money. This type of airline usually makes news for all the wrong reasons: did you hear about that one airline that charges for power sockets, and doesn\u2019t allow you to bring your own food? How about the one with 12-hour flights with no seatback entertainment screens? The overnight flight with no included meals? Or the airlines that put an extra seat in every row to really pack people in? But for the savvy traveler, the low prices can be a steal. Do be sure you\u2019re not caught out when it comes to exactly what kind of ticket you\u2019re booking, and what kind of seat you\u2019ll get, though. Some airlines like Frenchbee and AirAsia X pack an extra seat into every row of their airplanes, which means they\u2019re really narrow. Some, like Zipair and Scoot, don\u2019t have inflight entertainment, even in business class. Scoot even charges for power sockets in economy! What to look for when you book There are great deals to be had out there, whether you\u2019re aiming for the absolute cheapest flight or you are interested in a low-cost premium economy (or in a couple of cases, low-cost business class) experience. But how do you what you\u2019re going to get? Check each airline\u2019s website carefully for what is and isn\u2019t included in each ticket type, as well as pricing and other details, such as: -Food. On long flights, you may have to buy a second meal even if the first one is included, while pre-ordering can be much cheaper. -Seat selection, including being seated together as a family or group, and what extra-legroom or extra-comfort options are available -Soft drinks and sometimes even water -Alcoholic beverages -Hand luggage weight and size -Checked baggage weight and size -Inflight entertainment and WiFi -Power sockets (yep!) -Pillows and blankets -Whether the airline prohibits bringing food on board (no, really) -Which airports and terminals they use. It might not be the main airport in the city, or a low-cost terminal with limited shops and restaurants. -Whether connections are \u201cprotected.\u201d If your inbound flight is delayed, is it on the airline to rebook you, or are you on your own? -Bundles of inclusions, like a package that gives you seat selection, a checked bag and a meal Each one is slightly different from the next, and by and large they concentrate on flights to and from a particular home-base airport. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the newest, biggest and most useful ones for international travelers: Frenchbee Home base: Paris (Orly, the old airport) Notable routes: LA, Miami, NY, SF, overseas France Flies: Airbus A350s, but with extra-narrow, 10-across seating What you need to know: Those 10-across A350 seats are narrow. \u201cBasic\u201d fares don\u2019t come with meals ($25, so bring a sandwich) or a checked bag. \u201cPremium\u201d seats are spacious premium economy and can be a good deal. There\u2019s some free seatback entertainment. LEVEL Home base: Barcelona Notable routes: Boston, LA, Miami, NY, SF, plus Buenos Aires and Santiago de Chile Flies: Airbus A330s What you need to know: This is the long-haul, low-cost carrier from IAG, which owns British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, and offers connections via Barcelona. LEVEL has decent eight-across economy seating and a premium economy cabin called, shockingly enough, Premium Cabin. Norse Atlantic Home base: Oslo, but flights to and from London (Gatwick), Paris (Orly), Berlin and Rome, too Notable routes: Boston, Chicago, LA, Miami, NY, Orlando, SF Flies: Boeing 787s.\u00a0Don\u2019t call it \u201cNorwegian, but with new paint,\u201d but they\u2019re exactly the same planes that used to fly for Norwegian. What you need to know: The ex-Norwegian planes mean older seats, but the premium cabin has oodles of legroom and is one of the best deals in flying. Air Premia Home base: Seoul (Incheon, the international airport) Notable routes: Honolulu, LA, Newark, Frankfurt Flies: Boeing 787s What you need to know: Air Premia offers above-average seat features and loads of legroom, plus a good premium cabin that can be a great deal if you\u2019re flexible. Zipair Tokyo Home base: Tokyo (Narita, the airport an hour away from the city) Notable routes: Honolulu, LA, SF, San Jose (CA) Flies: Boeing 787s What you need to know: This is Japan Airlines\u2019 low-cost arm. It offers a real full-flat pod as ZIP Full-Flat. There\u2019s no seat-back entertainment in economy or business. Scoot Home base: Singapore Notable routes: Berlin-Athens (there\u2019s a stopover in Athens), plus many useful connections into Asia Flies: Boeing 787s What you need to know: This is Singapore Airlines\u2019 low-cost arm, with connections across the region. There\u2019s a small Scoot-in-Silence quiet cabin (no kids under 12) and premium-economy style ScootPlus seats. There\u2019s no seatback entertainment. Read the terms and conditions carefully: in-seat power comes at a fee, while outside food is technically banned. Jetstar Home base: all major Australian cities, plus the Gold Coast Notable routes: Honolulu, east Asia, Southeast Asia Flies: Boeing 787s What you need to know: This is Qantas\u2019 low-cost arm, with connections across Australia, New Zealand and southeast Asia. Older planes mean older seats, but the premium economy style Jetstar Business can be good value. AirAsia X Home base: Kuala Lumpur Notable routes: east Asia, southeast Asia and Australia. London keeps getting pushed back\u2026 Flies: Airbus A330s, but with extra-narrow nine-across seating What you need to know: AirAsia X is part of the Asian low-cost powerhouse AirAsia, with a massive connecting network. There are no screens, only streaming inflight entertainment to your own device (that\u2019s \u201ctemporarily suspended\u201d). Premium Flatbed \u2014\u00a0those old 2000s-style sloping sleeper seats that recline to a flat surface but are still at an angle to the floor \u2014\u00a0can cost less than other airlines\u2019 economy.",

            "text": "JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon and his family plan to sell one million of their shares in the bank starting next year, according to a new securities filing. Dimon \u2014 who will use his stock trading plans to offload his shares \u2014 and his family currently own roughly 8.6 million shares in the company. The move marks Dimon\u2019s first stock sale during his 17 years at the company\u2019s helm. JPMorgan Chase shares closed at $140.76 on Thursday, putting the transaction\u2019s worth at roughly $141 million. \u201cMr. Dimon continues to believe the company\u2019s prospects are very strong and his stake in the company will remain very significant,\u201d JPMorgan Chase said in the filing. CNN has reached out to the company for comment. Shares of JPMorgan Chase have climbed roughly 5% this year during what\u2019s been a tough environment for banks. The Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive pace of interest rate hikes, which began in 2022, has crimped demand for loans\u00a0and\u00a0forced banks to pay up for clients\u2019 high-yielding holdings.\u00a0At the same time, banks have watched\u00a0the value of their own bond investments erode in value. JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank by assets, has managed to turn out earnings beats this year despite the stormy conditions. The bank in May acquired most assets of collapsed regional lender First Republic, a move that helped JPMorgan Chase\u2019s profit jump 35% last quarter. But Dimon has warned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s fight against inflation isn\u2019t over and could weaken the remarkably resilient economy. He has also sounded alarm bells that wars in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza could have damaging consequences for global financial markets and geopolitical relationships. \u201cNow may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,\u201d Dimon said earlier this month, when announcing the bank\u2019s third-quarter financial results.",

            "text": "A Chinese fighter jet came within 10 feet of a US Air Force B-52 bomber flying over the South China Sea on Tuesday, according to the US military. The Chinese pilot \u201cflew in an unsafe and unprofessional manner, demonstrated poor airmanship by closing with uncontrolled excessive speed, flying below, in front of, and within 10 feet of the B-52, putting both aircraft in danger of collision,\u201d US Indo-Pacific Command said in a Thursday statement. \u201cWe are concerned this pilot was unaware of how close he came to causing a collision.\u201d News of the latest Chinese intercept comes as President Joe Biden is\u00a0expected to speak with Chinese\u00a0Foreign Minister Wang Yi when he visits the White House on Friday, CNN reported on Thursday.\u00a0It is not clear whether the meeting will be a formal discussion or a more informal meet and greet.\u00a0Wang is also expected to meet with Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday and national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Friday. Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping may also meet on the sidelines of the APEC Summit in San Francisco next month, though neither side has confirmed finalized plans. The US and China on Thursday both released footage accusing each other of provocative maneuvers\u00a0in and around the South China Sea, escalating tensions over the disputed waterway. China\u2019s Defense Ministry released a video during a regular press briefing, saying the USS Ralph Johnson \u201cconducted close-in harassment\u201d against a Chinese navy task group doing routine training in the South China Sea on August 19. Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Wu Qian said the video \u201cshows that the US side is the real provoker, risk-taker and disrupter.\u201d Wu said the US warship\u2019s actions \u201cendanger China\u2019s national security\u201d and added China would \u201ctake all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty. \u201cUS fighter jets coming all the way to flex their muscles at our doorstep is the root cause of aviation and maritime safety risks,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in\u00a0response to a question for comment on the incident during\u00a0a regular briefing on Friday. The Pentagon\u2019s top official in charge of security in the Indo-Pacific, Ely Ratner, said\u00a0earlier this month\u00a0that the US has seen more instances of \u201ccoercive and risky\u201d behavior from\u00a0Chinese pilots\u00a0against US aircraft in the last two years over the East and South China Seas than in the entire decade before that. \u201cSince the fall of 2021, we have seen more than 180 such incidents,\u201d Ratner said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a centralized and concerted campaign to perform these risky behaviors in order to coerce a change in lawful US operational activity.\u201d The Pentagon\u2019s efforts this year to engage with Chinese military leadership have gone unanswered, and US officials have grown increasingly concerned about the lack of military-to-military dialogue between the countries. Beijing cut off the communications after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan last year, infuriating Chinese leaders. \u201cI\u2019ve asked to speak with my counterparts, the eastern and southern theater commanders now, going on two and a half years,\u201d\u00a0INDOPACOM commander Adm. John Aquilino said earlier this month. \u201cI have yet to have one of those requests accepted.\u201d As part of the latest National Defense Strategy, the US has pointed to China as the \u201cpacing challenge,\u201d capable of competing with America in terms of its military might, economic power and international reach. Beijing already possesses a standing army of more than one million soldiers, the largest navy in the world by number of ships and the largest air force in the region. Beijing claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the South China Sea, and uses its military might to assert its claims of sovereignty in the disputed waters and beyond, including Taiwan. In 2022, the Chinese military increased its aggressive actions towards the island, including ballistic missile overflights, military aircraft flying into Taiwan\u2019s aerial identification zone and major exercises near Taiwan. Though Xi has said he is seeking the peaceful unification of Taiwan with China, he has not renounced the use of military force to achieve his goal. This story has been updated with additional details. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misspelled Adm. John Aquilino\u2019s name. CNN\u2019s Kathleen Magramo contributed to this report.",

            "text": "The founder of the world\u2019s biggest chipmaker,\u00a0Morris\u00a0Chang, said on Thursday that increasing tensions over technology between the United States and China will slow down the global chip industry. Chang, who founded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co\u00a0in the late 1980s, made the remarks at an event hosted by the Asia Society in New York. The company has helped the democratically governed island of Taiwan become the world\u2019s leading producer of advanced chips. US officials earlier this month enacted another set of export restrictions that\u00a0clamped down\u00a0on what chips and chipmaking tools can be exported to China after Huawei\u00a0last month\u00a0showed off\u00a0a phone with a new domestically manufactured chip. Chang, 92, said that cutting off China\u2019s chip industry from the rest of the world would affect other players beyond China. \u201cI think that decoupling will ultimately slow down everybody. Of course, the immediate purpose is to slow China down, and I think it\u2019s doing that,\u201d\u00a0Chang\u00a0said. Chang\u00a0said that the effects of such decoupling were already becoming clear and that many previous economic conflicts between established and emerging powers had ended in wars. \u201cIt looks like countries are mad at each other, that worries me,\u201d said\u00a0Chang, who characterizes the geopolitical tension between the United States and China as an existing power confronting an emerging power. \u201cOur only hope is it doesn\u2019t lead to anything even more serious,\u201d\u00a0Chang\u00a0said. He also praised the higher education system in the United States, adding his optimism about the country as TSMC invests to build chipmaking facilities in Arizona. Born and raised in China,\u00a0Chang\u00a0built a career in the United States, where he become a naturalized citizen in 1962, before being recruited to build the chip industry in Taiwan. He is now regarded as a legendary figure in the industry that\u2019s caught in the middle of the geopolitical tension. \u201cI really think this country, which is my country, [the] United States, is still the hope of the world, that\u2019s in spite of all the problems we are having,\u201d said\u00a0Chang.",

            "text": "Two cargo planes recently orchestrated by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to carry supplies into Israel also contained drones, body armor and helmets for the war-ready country, CNN has learned. The Israeli government procured the equipment and asked the state of Florida for help transporting it overseas, a source with knowledge of the arrangement told CNN. The supplies were included on two cargo planes that left Florida for Israel on October 17. DeSantis\u2019 office previously said the cargo\u00a0flights\u00a0carried \u201cmedical supplies, clothing items, hygiene products and children\u2019s toys\u201d that had been donated to help Israel in the aftermath of the attack by Hamas earlier this month, but it did not mention that the state was also carrying equipment for Israel that could be used in response to the war effort. The governor\u2019s office confirmed to CNN on Thursday the inclusion of the additional equipment. \u201cAt the request of the Israeli Consul General in Miami, cargo planes contracted by Florida were used to transport healthcare and hospital supplies, drones, body armor, and helmets that first responders can use,\u201d Jeremy Redfern, a spokesman for the governor\u2019s office, said in a statement. Redfern said that the governor\u2019s office also worked with the Israeli consul general to \u201chelp get weapons and ammunition to Israel through private parties.\u201d However, the source said Florida did not transport those supplies, and it\u2019s unclear how the state aided Israel in the movement of munitions. DeSantis, a Republican presidential candidate, has regularly touted his push to arrange flights to help Israel in the aftermath of the attack by Hamas that killed at least 1,400 people, including planes used to evacuate Americans out of the region. In media appearances and on the campaign trail, DeSantis has highlighted these efforts as evidence of his leadership and has accused President Joe Biden of not doing enough to assist Americans looking to leave the war-torn region. The Biden administration has also chartered flights from Israel to destinations in Europe amid a scramble to get Americans back to the US. \u201cWhen there\u2019s no leadership, you have a choice: Are you going to just kind of sit there and complain about it or are you going to step up and are you going to lead?\u201d DeSantis said earlier this month. \u201cWe make things happen particularly at times of crisis.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Israeli Embassy in Washington, DC, for comment. DeSantis declared a state of emergency in Florida on October 12, giving him authority to mobilize state resources to \u201cbring Floridians home and transport necessary supplies to Israel.\u201d On October 15, DeSantis\u2019 office announced that his administration worked with Project Dynamo, a nonprofit that carries out international rescue missions, to evacuate about 270 people from Israel to Tampa. DeSantis and his wife, Casey, greeted the returning Floridians on the tarmac. Two days later, two cargo planes carrying 85 pallets left Tampa for Israel. According to a press release, the packed items included bandages, hospital gowns, IV kits, needles, syringes, ventilators and surgical gloves, as well as toys, sleeping bags and hygiene products. It was those planes that also carried the equipment for the Israeli government. To conduct these missions, the state has contracted with ARS Global Emergency Management, one of three companies selected by Florida to carry out DeSantis\u2019 controversial migrant transport program. ARS Global Emergency Management has so far invoiced the state about $19 million for these missions to Israel, which also includes costs of hotel stays, food and other expenses, in addition to the planes, crews and fuel, the state has said. By declaring a state of emergency, DeSantis can access a $500 million fund that does not require him to first receive legislative approval.",

            "text": "Cost overruns for the new Air Force One jets continue to pile on massive losses for Boeing.  Boeing on Wednesday reported another $482 million in red ink on the contract to retrofit two 747 jets into the next generation of the presidential plane. Boeing has now lost more than $1 billion on each of the two jets.  The company has been reporting losses on the planes for years, as CEO Dave Calhoun admitted last year that the company should never have signed the contract with the Air Force to produce the jets for $3.9 billion. Supplier costs have soared since then, and the delivery date has been continually pushed back. Boeing took $1.45 billion in losses on the planes last year, and $318 million in 2021. \u201cAir Force One, I\u2019m just going to call a very unique moment, a very unique negotiation. A very unique set of risks that Boeing probably shouldn\u2019t have taken,\u201d Calhoun said in April last year when discussing $660 million of those losses reported at that time. \u201cBut we are where we are.\u201d The company said the latest loss on the program is a result of engineering changes, labor instability, as well as the resolution of negotiations with one of its suppliers. Very often higher costs on defense contracts can be passed onto US taxpayers, but under pressure from then-President Donald Trump, who was threatening to cancel the contract for the planes, Boeing agreed to a fixed price contract on the two new jets. \u201cIn a fixed price environment, any unplanned hurdles can introduce unrecoverable costs,\u201d Calhoun told investors Wednesday. \u201cAt the end of the day, we have two airplanes to build. We\u2019re getting past these hurdles and are committed to delivering two exceptional airplanes for our customer.\u201d Technically the program is known as the VC-25B, since the famous \u201cAir Force One\u201d designation is reserved for when the president is actually on any US Air Force-operated plane, not when it is on the ground, let alone under construction. The latest loss on the Air Force One jets is only a fraction of the losses reported by the troubled aircraft manufacturer, which has reported losses in all but two quarters since early 2019. Total losses at the company now total $25.5 billion since the grounding of its 737 Max jet for 20 months starting in March of 2019, following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. Wednesday it reported another core operating loss of $1.1 billion, or $3.26 a share. While that\u2019s down 65% from the loss reported in the same quarter a year earlier, it\u2019s worse than the  $2.96 a share loss forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The company had reported a bigger than expected loss almost every quarter since its problems began. Revenue was slightly better than forecasts though, rising 13% to $18.1 billion. And while the company trimmed the number of 737 Max jets it expects to deliver this year, it announced it is increasing the number of 787 jets it is building to five per month, and it plans to complete its increase in 737 production to 38 a month by the end of the year. That guidance, and the company saying it still expects to be cash flow positive for the year, helped lift Boeing shares 3% in premarket trading.",

            "text": "JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Citigroup\u2019s Jane Fraser and other top names on Wall Street are in Saudi Arabia Tuesday for an investment conference as they try to look beyond risks that the Israel-Hamas war could widen into a regional conflict and deal a new blow to the global economy. Dubbed \u201cDavos in the Desert,\u201d the annual Future Investment Initiative (FII) will welcome about 6,000 participants from more than 90 countries over the next three days. Now in its seventh year, the event has retained its appeal despite US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin warning Sunday about \u201cpotential escalation\u201d in the Middle East and possible attacks on American interests. Since the Hamas assault on October 7, Israel has widened its offensive against the Palestinian militant group and other regional enemies. The Israel Defense Forces have intensified their bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip, striking Hezbollah cells in Lebanon and targets in the occupied West Bank.  Despite the escalating conflict, scores of senior executives stuck with plans to head to Riyadh over the coming days to meet with clients and speak on panels at the FII. Other notable names attending include Blackrock\u2019s (BLK) Larry Fink, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon, HSBC (HSBC) CEO Noel Quinn, billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio and private equity executives Stephen Schwarzman and Harvey Schwartz of Blackstone (BX) and Carlyle (CG) respectively. But several participants sounded a gloomy note on the global economy during a discussion Tuesday, as conflict threatens to further depress activity already being squeezed by the impact of recent aggressive interest rate hikes. \u201cWe\u2019re sitting here with a backdrop of the aftermath of\u2026 the terrorist attack in Israel and the events that have been unfolding since and it\u2019s desperately sad. So it\u2019s hard not to be a little pessimistic given that,\u201d said Fraser of Citigroup (C). Fink said that if the wars in Israel and Ukraine are not resolved it will lead to greater fear and insecurity and less hope in society. \u201cWhen there\u2019s less hope we see contractions in our economies,\u201d he noted. Saudi Arabia\u2019s sway But the turnout for the event underscores that investors remain interested in the Middle East, which saw some of the strongest rates of economic growth globally in 2022. There\u2019s another powerful draw card: Saudi Arabia\u2019s enormous sovereign wealth fund. The Public Investment Fund (PIF) has grown in importance as a global investor, particularly as high interest rates and rising geopolitical tensions dampen the appetite for risk taking among institutions in Europe and the United States. People are heading to the conference because \u201cthat\u2019s where the money is,\u201d said Karen E. Young, a senior research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy. \u201cFor many people who are seeking an investment from the PIF, this is the place you have to be,\u201d she told CNN. The fund has seen its assets under management soar to approximately $700 billion, from $250 billion in 2018, according to Goldman Sachs. Its portfolio of international investments span Uber (UBER), US electric car company Lucid (LCID) and India\u2019s Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail. The PIF was also one of the first \u2014 and the biggest \u2014 investors in Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund, which has backed dozens of startups since its inception in 2017, including WeWork and Slack.  Money in the Middle East The fund\u2019s growing clout has helped the Future Investment Initiative weather its fair share of geopolitical storms since launching in 2017. Last year, the event took place amid a very public spat between Riyadh and Washington over oil production cuts orchestrated by Saudi Arabia and its OPEC+ partner Russia. And in 2018, dozens of top business leaders boycotted the conference as questions swirled over the Saudi government\u2019s role in the killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.  Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince Mohammad bin Salman, denied any personal involvement in Khashoggi\u2019s murder but later confirmed it was carried out by Saudi officials.   Bin Salman chairs the Public Investment Fund. He has also been at the center of efforts to normalize relations between the Kingdom and Israel, saying last month that a pact would be \u201cthe biggest historical deal since the Cold War.\u201d Last week, bin Salman urged \u201call possible efforts to prevent the expansion of violence that will affect the stability of the region,\u201d and stressed the \u201cimportance of working to create conditions for the return of stability and the restoration of the path of peace to ensure that the Palestinian people obtain their legitimate rights,\u201d according to the state-run Saudi news agency SPA. Among those not attending the FII this week is Softbank CEO, Masayoshi Son. A spokesperson for the company said this was due to a \u201cfamily health matter,\u201d without providing further details.  \u201cVery few people\u201d had canceled plans to attend the conference, according to Richard Attias, the CEO of the FII Institute, the event\u2019s organizer.  \u201cThe Middle East is the new emerging economy, the new emerging hub and people know that,\u201d he said in comments posted to the SPA\u2019s X account. There could be another, more practical reason why people are sticking with the event, according to Young of Columbia University: the price of tickets, which come in at around $15,000 per person, excluding the cost of flights and accommodation. \u201cFirms have invested to come\u2026 It is not a small fee,\u201d she said. \u2014 Winston Lo and Michelle Toh in Hong Kong contributed reporting.",

Al Baker, who has led the airline since 1997, will step down on Nov. 5. The move was unexpected, and no reason was given by Qatar Airways for his departure. The airline said he will be replaced by Badr Mohammed Al Meer, the chief operating officer of Doha Hamad Airport, which serves as the airline\u2019s base. Known as one of the industry\u2019s most outspoken and influential executives, Al Baker is widely credited with transforming Qatar Airways into one of the world\u2019s top airlines. During his 27-year tenure, he oversaw aggressive expansion and investment into Doha airport, which is now an established global hub. Al Baker currently serves as the airport\u2019s chief executive. Al Baker often courted controversy with his forthright views on the airline sector. In June, he told CNN the industry\u2019s net zero targets were a \u201cPR exercise\u201d and predicted they would be missed. In 2018, Al Baker apologized for making sexist comments at an International Air Transport Association meeting. When asked about gender inequality in the industry, Al Baker said \u201cof course\u201d Middle East airlines must be led by a man, \u201cbecause it is a very challenging position.\u201d  After the comments caused uproar, Al Baker expressed remorse in a statement, saying \u201cit would be my pleasure if I could help develop a female candidate to be the next CEO of Qatar Airways.\u201d",

Perhaps sensibly, most companies avoid wading into the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But when the barbarous scale of Hamas\u2019s October 7 attacks on Israel became clear, staying silent ceased to be an option.  \u201cSaying nothing speaks to cowardice,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management who focuses on corporate leadership among other issues. \u201cThey\u2019ll have a hard time celebrating their corporate character and what they stand for if they sit mutely on the sidelines.\u201d With that in mind, many companies have rallied in support of Israel. Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella said he was \u201cheartbroken by the horrific terrorist attacks on Israel.\u201d Sundar Pichai, his counterpart at Google, was \u201cdeeply saddened.\u201d Disney (DIS) donated $2 million for humanitarian relief in Israel, and banks have contributed millions too, as Reuters reported. All in, around 80 household-name companies in America have condemned the Hamas attacks, as tracked by Sonnenfeld who maintains a list. Many organizations, though, have opted for a more cautious approach, especially those outside of the United States. In the United Kingdom, Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, traditionally associated with its Jewish supporters, came under fire after saying it was \u201c\u200b\u200bshocked and saddened by the escalating crisis in Israel and Gaza.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t ever call yourself a Jewish club again,\u201d replied one fan, in an apparent response to the mention of Gaza. \u201cYou guys are absolutely pathetic,\u201d railed another. Paddy Cosgrove, CEO of the Web Summit, which describes itself as the biggest tech conference in the world, was forced to apologize after accusing Israel of war crimes.  Simply staying under the radar or equivocating are not viable responses, in the view of Lior Susan, founding partner of venture capital firm Eclipse.  \u201cNot taking a stand is taking a stand,\u201d Susan, who served in the Israeli special forces, told CNN. \u201cCompanies need to show moral clarity and leadership in the face of the Israel-Hamas war.\u201d  Richard Griffiths, managing director at London-based strategic communications consultancy Citigate Dewe Rogerson, makes a similar point. \u201cWe saw with the Russian attacks on Ukraine that there is now a much greater expectation that companies should be seen to do the right thing and speak out,\u201d he said.  However, with the Israel-Hamas war, he cautions, the situation is more complex. \u201cThis is a conflict between Israel and an internationally recognised terrorist organization,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe wisest action for businesses now is to show solidarity with all those caught up in this, with a focus on easing the humanitarian aspect.\u201d Any stand a company takes \u201chas to relate to what will resonate with your employees, customers and investors,\u201d Griffiths added. \u201cIt is important to understand what stakeholder expectations are before you wade in.\u201d     And once that stand has been taken, companies should stick to their guns. \u201cA company has to have the courage of its convictions,\u201d said Sonnenfeld, whose list of foreign companies still doing business in Russia has been credited with speeding up a corporate stampede from the country, \u201cwhatever they are.\u201d",

Used in the filming of the final battle in \u201cStar Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\u201d as the Rebel Alliance fight the Empire above the Death Star, the model \u201crepresents the pinnacle of Star Wars artifacts to ever reach the market,\u201d Dallas-based auction house Heritage Auctions said.   The top two wings of the fighter are both painted with a single red stripe, identifying it as the squadron\u2019s \u201cRed Leader.\u201d   The model is part of a collection that belonged to the late Greg Jein, an Oscar- and Emmy-nominated miniature-maker known for his work on \u201cStar Trek\u201d and \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\u201d and will be auctioned on October 14-15.   Long known as \u201cthe missing X-wing,\u201d it was discovered by a team of visual effects experts, including Gene Kozicki (\u201cFace/Off\u201d and \u201cFlight of the Phoenix\u201d), as they helped Jein\u2019s family sift through his collection, Kozicki told the Hollywood Reporter.  \u201cThis model has not been displayed or modified since it left ILM (visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic),\u201d Kozicki said. \u201cFor those of us that grew up in the \u201970s or \u201880s, and those of us that work in visual effects, this model is as significant a find as the ruby red slippers or the Maltese Falcon.\u201d The 1:24 miniature was one of four \u201chero\u201d models built for filming close-ups in key moments during the space battle, including in shots during the trench run as the rebel fleet seeks to destroy the Death Star.    Several \u201cpyro\u201d models were also built according to a much simpler design, which could then be blown up, while the four \u201chero\u201d models featured intricate painting, wings that spread open into \u201cAttack Position,\u201d a miniature pilot, internal wiring to power lights inside the spaceship as well as minute details such as blast marks and heat-scorching around exhaust nozzles.  They were designed by the Oscar-winning team Industrial Light & Magic according to basic specifications from director George Lucas, who wanted to create distinct shapes for the climactic battle so the audience could distinguish between the Rebel Alliance and the Empire. Kozicki told the Hollywood Reporter that it isn\u2019t clear how Jein came into possession of this model, speculating that he sometimes obtained items to trade for something else later on.   \u201c(Steven Spielberg\u2019s) \u2018Close Encounters of the Third Kind\u2019 and \u2018Star Wars\u2019 were being made at roughly the same time, and with an overlapping group of people,\u201d Kozicki said. \u201cAnd at that time no one, not even Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, could anticipate the impact these films would have on the industry or cultural zeitgeist.\u201d",

            "text": "The Pentagon has ordered a second carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean Sea and is sending Air Force fighter jets to the region as Israel prepares to expand its Gaza operations, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Saturday. The US warships are not intended to join the fighting in Gaza or take part in Israel\u2019s operations, but the presence of two of the Navy\u2019s most powerful vessels is designed to send a message of deterrence to Iran and Iranian proxies in the region, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon. The movements are \u201cpart of our effort to deter hostile actions against Israel or any efforts toward widening this war following Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel,\u201d Austin said in the statement. The first carrier strike group, led by the USS Gerald R. Ford, arrived off the coast of Israel last week. Now the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower strike group, which deployed from Norfolk, Virginia, on Friday, is headed to the eastern Mediterranean. The aircraft carrier was initially set to sail for the waters of US European Command. It is unclear how long the Ford will stay in the region once the Eisenhower carrier strike group arrives, one US defense official told CNN. The Eisenhower, which is the flagship of the carrier strike group, will be joined by a guided-missile cruiser and two guided-missile destroyers, Austin\u2019s statement said. The Eisenhower can carry more than 60 aircraft, including F/A-18 fighter jets. The Ford can deploy more than 75 aircraft. ABC News first reported the carrier strike group\u2019s orders.   US forces not there to aid Israel The Biden administration made clear that the carrier and its accompanying force are not there to engage in combat activities on behalf of Israel. \u201cThere is no intention or plan to put American troops on the ground in Israel,\u201d John Kirby, strategic communications coordinator for the National Security Council, said Thursday.  \u201cWe take our national security interests very seriously in the region,\u201d he said, noting that the purpose of the bolstered force posture was \u201cto act as a deterrent for any other actor, including Hezbollah, that might think that widening this conflict is a good idea.\u201d However, on Sunday, Kirby wouldn\u2019t rule out sending in US troops to help free Americans who may be held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.  Speaking to \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Kirby said there were \u201cno plans or intentions to put US troops on the ground in the fight between Israel and Hamas,\u201d but when pressed repeatedly on whether the administration was considering deploying troops to save Americans, he wouldn\u2019t say no.  \u201cWhat I won\u2019t do is rule anything in or out when it comes to getting our hostages home,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re working on this literally by the hour.\u201d   Kirby said Sunday that the US knows there are Americans being held hostage by Hamas \u2013 going beyond his comments Wednesday, when he said the US believed there were Americans among the hostages.  \u201cWe don\u2019t even know how many exactly. A small handful we know, there could be more than we know, they could be in different groups, they could be moved around,\u201d he said Sunday.  In addition, the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, a rapid reaction force capable of conducting special operations, is making preparations in case it is ordered closer to Israel to bolster the US\u2019 force posture there, multiple US officials told CNN. The unit, which is on board the amphibious assault ship USS Bataan, is composed of more than 2,000 Marines and sailors and would be capable of supporting a large-scale evacuation. Among the mission essential tasks for a Marine Expeditionary Unit are evacuation operations and humanitarian assistance. No such order has been given yet to the unit, the officials said.  More US warplanes sent to region Meanwhile, US Air Forces Central on Saturday announced the deployment of F-15E fighter jets and A-10 ground-attack jets to the region.  The movement of the warplanes from the 494th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron and 354th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron, respectively, \u201cbolster the U.S. posture and enhance air operations throughout the Middle East,\u201d an Air Force statement said. It did not give specific numbers of warplanes involved. A-10s from the 354th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron arrived in the Middle East on Sunday, US Air Forces Central tweeted. \u201cThis arrival bolsters the U.S. defense posture, enhances air operations throughout the Middle East, and reassures our allies and regional partners we remain postured to protect and defend their freedom,\u201d the tweet added. A US Central Command social media post said the A-10s would join another squadron of the aircraft already in the region. US Defense Secretary Austin\u2019s statement said F-16 fighters have also been deployed to the region. \u201cBy posturing advanced fighters and integrating with joint and coalition forces, we are strengthening our partnerships and reinforcing security in the region,\u201d Lt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, 9th Air Force commander, said in a statement. Defense officials have said repeatedly in recent days that the Pentagon will be able to flow in additional forces and assets to the region quickly as needed, as Israel continues to fight a war against the terrorist group Hamas.

The New York-based bank also reported a 6% drop in investment banking revenue in the third quarter. Investment banking fees fell by 3% because of lower equity and debt underwriting activity, said the bank. Deposits fell by 4% from a year earlier during the third quarter. A wall of worry In a call on Friday morning, Dimon told CNN that bank executives across the United States are \u201cclimbing the wall of worry,\u201d referring to the Wall Street truism that explains how markets can remain strong through economic uncertainty and negative news. \u201cAnd we should,\u201d said Dimon. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of our job, to be prepared for potential outcomes you don\u2019t expect.\u201d Wall Street, he said, is often focused on current conditions instead of preparing for what could come next. \u201cWe do a hundred stress tests a week,\u201d said Dimon. \u201cUsually, geopolitics presents itself as a deep recession or a mild recession\u2026 And markets doing well is not a reason ever to say they will continue to do well.\u201d Still, economists at JPMorgan now say that a soft landing \u2014 where the economy slows down without triggering a severe downturn and high unemployment \u2014  is now more likely than a recession.  \u201cI\u2019m less concerned about the economic effect than obviously the geopolitical,\u201d Dimon said Friday. \u201cCurrently, US consumers and businesses generally remain healthy.\u201d Dimon also said that tight labor markets and high government debt levels could keep inflation elevated for some time and that interest rates could rise further.  In previous interviews, Dimon has said that the Federal Reserve may be far from finished with its aggressive regimen of interest rate hikes in the fight against elevated inflation, and that it\u2019s possible the central bank will continue hiking rates by another 1.5 percentage points, to 7%. Shares of the bank were trading 4.8% higher on Friday. Wells Fargo shares also rose 4.3% after beating top- and bottom-line expectations, and Citigroup shares added 3.7% after reporting better-than-expected revenue.",

            "text": "Israeli billionaire Idan Ofer and his wife Batia are quitting a Harvard executive board in protest of how university leaders have responded to Hamas\u2019 terror attacks on Israel. \u201cUnfortunately, our faith in the University\u2019s leadership has been broken and we cannot in good faith continue to support Harvard and its committees,\u201d the couple said in a statement to CNN. Idan Ofer has amassed a fortune valued at nearly $20 billion, according to Bloomberg\u2019s billionaire index, where the Israeli ranks No. 80.   The decision by the Ofers to step down from the executive board of Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government adds to the swirl of controversy at the university following the release of an anti-Israel statement by a coalition of student groups. That letter solely blamed Israel for the deadly attacks by Hamas, setting off a firestorm and prompting some students to distance themselves from it.  The anti-Israel letter was not the main reason the Ofers decided to resign and criticize Harvard leadership, a person familiar with the matter told CNN on Friday. Instead, the resignation was driven by how Harvard leaders responded to the attacks on Israel, the source said. \u201cWe denounce those who seek to place blame on the people of Israel for the atrocities committed by the terrorist organisation, Hamas,\u201d the Ofers said. \u201cOur decision\u201d to resign from the board \u201chas been precipitated by the lack of clear evidence of support from the University\u2019s leadership for the people of Israel following the tragic events of the past week, coupled with their apparent unwillingness to recognize Hamas for what it is, a terrorist organization,\u201d the Ofers said. The Kennedy School board is chaired by billionaire David Rubenstein and includes business and philanthropic leaders who advise the dean and are \u201camong the most committed financial supporters\u201d of the school, according to its website. Idan Ofer is a son of shipping billionaire Sammy Ofer, who was once Israel\u2019s richest man and died in 2011, according to Forbes. He owns a majority stake in Israel Corp., an energy, shipping and chemicals conglomerate. He is also a controller shareholder in Kenon Holdings, a New York-listed holding company. \u201cWith so much disinformation being spread by social media it is essential that the world\u2019s great institutions speak with a clear and unequivocal voice at this critical time,\u201d the Ofers said. Harvard did not comment on the resignation and criticism from the Ofers. The university instead pointed to a video statement released Thursday night by Harvard President Claudine Gay. \u201cPeople have asked me where we stand. So, let me be clear. Our University rejects terrorism \u2014 that includes the barbaric atrocities perpetrated by Hamas,\u201d Gay said. \u201cOur University rejects hate \u2014 hate of Jews, hate of Muslims, hate of any group of people based on their faith, their national origin, or any aspect of their identify.\u201d Gay added that Harvard \u201crejects the harassment or intimidation of individuals based on their beliefs\u201d and \u201cembraces a commitment to free expression.\u201d \u201cThat commitment extends even to views that many of us find objectionable, even outrageous. We do not punish or sanction people for expressing such views,\u201d Gay said. \u201cBut that is a far cry from endorsing them.\u201d After the anti-Israel statement was released, CEOs and business leaders including hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman called for the public release of the names of students linked to the organizations that backed the statement. That\u2019s despite the fact that some student distances themselves from the letter or said they hadn\u2019t seen it. A billboard \u201cdoxing truck\u201d drove near Harvard\u2019s campus on Wednesday displaying the names and faces of students who apparently were linked to the statement.",

            "title": "SpaceX fires back at FAA report suggesting its Starlink internet constellation could be deadly",
            "text": "SpaceX is asking federal regulators to correct a report that suggests the company\u2019s Starlink satellite constellation could pose grave risks to people on Earth. The report was delivered to members of Congress by the Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses the launch and reentry of commercial spacecraft, on October 5. The 35-page analysis, compiled in part by the nonprofit research group The Aerospace Corporation, offers a dire picture of the potential dangers associated with large networks of satellites such as Starlink, suggesting that by 2035, \u201cif the expected large constellation growth is realized and debris from Starlink satellites survive reentry \u2026 one person on the planet would be expected to be injured or killed every two years.\u201d It also estimates that the probability of an aircraft being downed by a collision with falling space debris could be 0.0007 per year by 2035. SpaceX slammed the report\u2019s conclusions in a letter dated October 9, calling the claims regarding risk of injury and death associated with Starlink \u201cpreposterous, unjustified, and inaccurate.\u201d The company\u2019s letter, obtained by CNN, \u00a0states that the report relied \u201con a deeply flawed analysis that falsely characterizes reentry disposal risks associated with Starlink.\u201d SpaceX also accused the Aerospace Corporation of failing to reach out to SpaceX for information and not including the company\u2019s own analysis and reports regarding Starlink satellite disposal. \u201cTo be clear, SpaceX\u2019s satellites are designed and built to fully demise during atmospheric reentry during disposal at end of life, and they do so,\u201d according to SpaceX\u2019s letter. The letter also states that 325 Starlink satellites have already deorbited since February 2020, and no debris has been found. In a statement issued Tuesday afternoon, the Aerospace Corporation said, \u201cOur technical team is in communication with SpaceX and others to review and update the data.\u201d The research group said it was approached by the FAA more than two years ago \u201cto do an independent assessment of collective\u00a0risks associated with satellite re-entry,\u00a0based upon the projection\u00a0of all planned operators under U.S. regulation\u00a0in 2021,\u201d according to the statement.\u00a0\u201cThe data included existing and planned constellations through 2035. The greatest percentage\u00a0of satellites were those in Low Earth Orbit.\u201d \u2018A significant risk over time\u2019 The FAA analysis does acknowledge that SpaceX says its Starlink satellites fully burn up in the atmosphere when they fall back to Earth at the end of service, posing no increased risk of striking people, airplanes or infrastructure. And the report acknowledges that the Federal Communications Commission, which authorizes satellite operators, accepted that assessment. But The Aerospace Corporation \u201cassessed that the SpaceX spacecraft could each produce three pieces of debris of 300 grams. For purposes of this report, the FAA uses the more conservative approach,\u201d according to the document. It also noted that \u201cwith the thousands of satellites expected to reenter, even a small amount of debris can impose a significant risk over time.\u201d SpaceX refuted that claim, stating that the assessment relied on \u201cegregious errors, omissions and incorrect assumptions.\u201d The company said the statistics were based on a 23-year-old NASA study about satellites developed by a different satellite operator, Iridium, and was never intended to be used for risk assessment purposes. SpaceX in its letter also criticized the report for focusing \u201conly on Starlink, disregarding other satellite systems like Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper, OneWeb, or any of the LEO systems being developed and deployed by China.\u201d (Emphasis added by SpaceX.) Starlink is mentioned 28 times in the FAA report, while Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper system is mentioned four times in data tables. The analysis also states that by 2035, SpaceX\u2019s satellites will account for \u201c85 percent of the expected risk to people on the ground and aviation.\u201d When reached for comment Tuesday, the FAA replied that it is \u201creviewing the letter.\u201d The four members of Congress who received the original report did not immediately provide a comment. The report was crafted for Congress in response to a 2020 statutory requirement that the FAA look into how \u2014 in its regulatory capacity \u2014 it might address safety risks associated with launch and reentry. The FAA states in the report that even if the agency \u201camended its regulations through rulemaking, the FAA\u2019s requirements would fall short of addressing all reentry risks to people on the ground or in aircraft since the FAA\u2019s authority does not extend to payloads launched from outside the United States.\u201d",

            "title": "Japan Airlines unveils high-tech interiors of new A350-1000 aircraft",
            "text": "When an airline places an order for new planes, it\u2019s given a great opportunity to boost its appeal among travelers looking for maximum comfort \u2013 particularly where long-haul flights are concerned. Japan Airlines (JAL) has done just that, this week unveiling the interiors of its high-tech new Airbus A350-1000 aircraft, \u201cwhich will become the airline\u2019s new flagship for international service after nearly 20 years,\u201d the carrier says in a statement. JAL has ordered 13 of the large, widebody planes from Airbus. The aircraft was originally going to enter service in late November, to be used on the Tokyo (Haneda) to New York (JFK) route. But that timeline has been postponed \u201cdue to a supply chain disruption affecting the delivery of components,\u201d says the statement, which adds the new aircraft will likely take flight \u201cbefore the end of the year.\u201d In the meantime, here\u2019s a sneak peek at what travelers will get to experience when they finally do board that new A350-1000. World\u2019s first headphone-free stereos In an age when amenities like showers and private suites are common offerings in commercial aviation, it can be a challenge for an airline to differentiate itself from the competition. This often requires them to offer something unexpected. In the case of JAL, they\u2019ve eliminated the need for headsets in the front end of the plane. Both first- and business-class cabins of the new A350-1000s will offer what the airline says is the \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d headphone-free stereo. Passengers can listen to the inflight entertainment system using the seats\u2019 built-in headrest speakers. The technology, created by French aircraft interior designer Safran in collaboration with audio tech company Devialet, was revealed at last year\u2019s Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) in Hamburg, Germany. CNN Travel\u2019s Francesca Street was there to test them out and had this to say about her experience: They are \u201cno replacement for the cocoon-like experience of noise-canceling headphones, but it\u2019s a comfortable set up and feels more akin to the experience of watching a movie on your couch. It would be perfect if you were flying with someone else and wanted to chat and interact as you watched a movie in tandem.\u201d First-class cabins The Haneda to JFK flight is nearly 13 hours \u2013 a lot of time in the sky \u2013 meaning passengers with the funds will be tempted by JAL\u2019s slick new first- and business-class suites. The first-class cabin will feature just six suites \u2013 each with a private sliding door \u2013 in  two rows of three. That\u2019s two fewer seats than what\u2019s offered in the first-class cabin on the Boeing 777-300ER jets now servicing many of JAL\u2019s long-haul flights. Privacy and space were key considerations here, with the airline even eliminating overhead compartments. Instead, each suite has increased storage space and a small closet. First-class passengers have a choice of three seating modes in their suites. There\u2019s the full sofa, a seat/single bed combo and the full double bed. As for size, each suite wall rises approximately 157 centimeters (62 inches) in height. Seat pitch is approximately 211 centimeters, with a width of around 123 centimeters.\u00a0The bed stretches out a comfortable 203 centimeters, while each monitor is 41 inches. Business-class cabins The\u00a0JAL 777-300ER jets currently serving JAL\u2019s long-haul flights have 49 business-class seats. With the new A350-1000, the airline will increase that number to 54, spread over 14 rows in a 1-2-1 configuration. Despite this jump, JAL says in the statement that \u201cample spacing has been prioritized to ensure a comfortable and individual inflight experience.\u201d Among the biggest changes coming are business-class suite doors, offering increased privacy, and the placement of the overhead storage bins, which have been positioned on the window sides only \u201cto create a more open atmosphere,\u201d says JAL. Size-wise, the suite walls are about 132 centimeters in height and each monitor is 24 inches. Seats have a width of about 56 centimeters, with a pitch of 130 centimeters. When converted into a bed, the length is approximately 198 centimeters. The airline says special cushioning structures evenly distribute body pressure. There\u2019s also an electric privacy partition for those traveling with companions and, similar to first-class, additional storage space inside each suite, including a small closet. Premium and economy cabins A common question among travelers: is it worth paying the extra for premium economy? Is there really that big of a difference? In an effort to take away the need for speculation, JAL is pulling out a few new stops. For instance, its adding large partitions between the 24 seats in its premium economy cabin, which will be laid out in a 2-4-2 configuration. It\u2019s also \u201cthe first premium economy class in the world to introduce electrically operated reclining functionality,\u201d says the airline. The seat width in this section is about 48 centimeters, with a pitch of 107 centimeters. There\u2019s also an electric leg rest that can be adjusted to sit horizontally for extra comfort. As for entertainment, the new 4K monitors are 16 inches \u2013 1.3 times larger than the current model, says the airline. And that just leaves economy class. It\u2019s worth noting that JAL was awarded the \u201cBest Economy Class Airline Seat\u201d five years in a row at the annual Skytrax \u201cWorld Airline Awards.\u201d These new A350-1000s are likely a reflection of the airline\u2019s goal to keep winning that title.\u00a0JAL says in the statement it \u201chas further enhanced the spacious legroom and improved the seating for enhanced comfort.\u201d Each of the plane\u2019s 155 Recaro-designed economy-class seats has a width of about 46 centimeters \u2013 the top end of the industry average \u2013 and a pitch of 84-86 centimeters. They are set up in a 3-3-3 configuration over 18 rows. Meanwhile, the 4k inflight monitors in this cabin are 13 inches and have Bluetooth connectivity, allowing passengers to use their own headsets while enjoying the inflight entertainment system.",

Richard McSpadden, 63, and Russ Francis, 70, died after the Cessna Cardinal they were flying crashed near the runway of the Lake Placid Airport, \u201cstriking an earth embankment,\u201d according to New York State Police.  McSpadden was the head of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association\u2019s Air Safety Institute, which focuses on curbing crashes of general aviation airplanes.  \u201cThe Cessna 177 Cardinal in which Richard was in the right seat experienced an emergency after takeoff,\u201d the association said in a statement. \u201cThe airplane attempted to return to the airport but failed to make the runway.\u201d The National Transportation Safety Board is leading the investigation. An initial Federal Aviation Administration incident report says the plane \u201ccrashed under unknown circumstances short of the runway.\u201d  Francis played for the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers for a total of 13 seasons and was a two-time All-Pro. He caught five passes for 60 yards as the 49ers won Super Bowl XIX in January 1985.  \u201cWe are deeply saddened by the sudden and tragic loss of former New England Patriots tight end Russ Francis,\u201d the organization said on social media. \u201cOur condolences are extended to Francis\u2019 family and friends.\u201d  Francis retired in 1998 and was in the top 15 for tight ends for receptions, touchdowns and receiving yards in a career.  \u201cRuss was a fan favorite throughout his playing career. He was a dynamic player on the field who had an even bigger personality off it. He knew no boundaries, pushed the limits and lived his life to the fullest,\u201d Patriots owner Robert Kraft said in a statement.  McSpadden was well respected in aviation circles and was the former commander of the US Air Force Thunderbirds demonstration team, having \u201cled 100 flight demonstrations flying the lead aircraft,\u201d according to his Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association biography.

            "title": "China Eastern Airlines just made the biggest C919 order ever, for 100 planes",
            "text": "China Eastern Airlines said on Thursday it will buy another 100 C919 airplanes in a deal worth $10 billion at list prices, in what would be the largest ever order for the jet made by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC). The state-owned carrier said it had received a \u201csubstantial discount\u201d for the deal and that the planes will be delivered in batches from 2024 to 2031. The list price for the C919 is $99 million but aircraft can be sold at discounts of up to 50%, especially for new models. The deal comes five months after the Chinese passenger plane, developed by state-owned COMAC to rival Airbus\u2019 A320neo and Boeing\u2019s (BA) 737 MAX single-aisle jet families, took its first flight in May with China Eastern. The Shanghai-headquartered, state-owned carrier is the first user of the C919 and has bought five of the jets, of which three have been delivered. The other two are expected to be delivered later this year. Boeing is still waiting to resume deliveries of its bestselling 737 MAX to Chinese airlines more than four years after they were halted following two deadly crashes. The company has been all but shut out of new orders from Chinese carriers since 2017 amid rising political and trade tensions between Beijing and Washington. Li Hanming, an independent aviation industry analyst, said the deal stemmed from a previous order of intent. \u201cIt is announced at the one year anniversary of C919\u2019s receiving its type certificate,\u201d Li said. \u201cCOMAC has made a good start in the delivery of C919 so far. Next, the plane manufacturer will cooperate with China Eastern more closely, to show other potential users the reliability and performance of C919.\u201d China Eastern said that the additional planes would add to its fleet at a time when air travel is seeing a strong recovery following three years of Covid curbs, and as the airline needs to retire a large number of its narrow-body aircraft due to their age. The airline said it would pay for the purchase in installments via its own funds, bank loans and bond issuance. China Eastern will get delivery of five aircraft in 2024, while ten are to be delivered each year from 2025 to 2027. From 2028 to 2030, 15 C919s will be delivered each year, and the last 20 jets will be delivered in 2031. Last week, GallopAir, a new Brunei-based airline, said it had signed a letter of intent to purchase 30 aircraft from China, worth $2 billion in total. The deal includes 15 orders of COMAC\u2019s ARJ21 aircraft and 15 of the C919.",

            "text": "Ryanair has announced cuts to its winter schedule due to delays in the delivery of Boeing aircraft, but Europe\u2019s largest airline by passenger numbers said its full-year traffic forecast was unaffected \u201cas yet.\u201d Ryanair (RYAAY), which is one of Boeing\u2019s largest customers, said in a statement Thursday that it had expected to receive delivery of 27 aircraft between September and December. However, production delays at the Spirit Fuselage facility in Wichita, Kansas, combined with Boeing\u2019s repair and delivery delays in Seattle, meant the budget airline now expects to receive only 14 aircraft between October and December. Flight cancellations will take effect from the end of October, and will be communicated to all affected passengers by email over the coming days, the airline said.  \u201cAt this early date, we do not expect these delivery delays will materially affect our full-year traffic target of 183.5 million [passengers],\u201d Ryanair chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary said.  \u201cBut if the delays worsen or extend further into the January-to-March 2024 period, we may have to revisit this figure and possibly adjust it slightly downward.\u201d Ryanair shares were down 2.8% at 5 a.m. ET. Asked if it could confirm the delays and when deliveries would be up to date, a spokesperson for Boeing said that the planemaker valued its partnership with Ryanair and was committed to supporting the airline. Ryanair already trimmed its full-year passenger forecast from 185 million in July, citing potential Boeing delays, as well as the impact of air traffic control strikes. O\u2019Leary consistently blasted Boeing throughout last year for delays that impacted deliveries up to its key 2023 summer season, but buried the hatchet in May with a multibillion-dollar deal for as many as 300 Boeing jets. Ryanair executives had said deliveries had \u201csignificantly improved\u201d before Boeing discovered a production flaw last month that has slowed deliveries of its best-selling 737 MAX aircraft. The budget airline said the cuts would affect Charleroi airport in Belgium, Dublin in Ireland and Italian airports including Bergamo, Naples and Pisa. There will also be reductions at East Midlands airport in the UK, Porto in Portugal and Cologne, Germany, it said. It had expected delivery of 57 Boeing aircraft between September 2023 and May 2024 and said it was working to try to accelerate deliveries in the January to May 2024 period so that it can enter the Summer 2024 peak travel season with all aircraft delivered as expected.",

He didn\u2019t offer specifics. Bastian said the changes announced earlier this month were designed to make certain that Delta could serve all of the loyalty tiers at the level that is expected. \u201cNo question, we probably went too far in doing that,\u201d Bastian said at the event Monday. \u201cOur team wanted to kind of rip the BandAid off and didn\u2019t want to have to keep going through this every year with changes and nickel and diming and whatnot, and I think we moved too fast.\u201d In September, the company implemented changes that would make it more difficult for American Express cardholders to access Delta Sky Clubs and earn Medallion elite status, taking effect in 2025. For frequent flyers, the airline will also change how it awards Medallion elite status starting in 2024. There will only be one metric \u2014 Medallion Qualifying Dollars (MQD) \u2014 and requirements are higher than what they are today. It\u2019s also getting rid of the MQD waiver that popular Delta credit cards offered. Bastian said a jump in the number of elite status holders turned into too much demand for Delta\u2019s premium services, such as airport lounge access. It got to the point, he said, that the company couldn\u2019t effectively serve those elite status holders, including upgrade certificates and agents on special phone lines. During Covid, the number of diamond-level members almost doubled, he said, after the company allowed status and miles to roll over while customers weren\u2019t traveling. The airline is still in the process of assessing what changes will be made to the new policies. Delta confirmed Bastian\u2019s comments. Rewards programs are an important tool for companies to acquire customers, learn more about their preferences, and promote brand loyalty. But while rewards members may love freebies and other perks, they\u2019re equally quick to criticize companies for any tweaks. Brands from Best Buy to Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and Starbucks faced quick backlash when they implemented changes to their loyalty programs.",

            "text": "Alibaba said Tuesday that it would spin off Cainiao, its logistics arm, in what will be the conglomerate\u2019s first initial public offering since it announced a sweeping revamp of its business earlier this year.  Alibaba Group (BABA) said in a regulatory filing that it had received regulatory approval to list Cainiao Smart Logistics Network on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, though it did not specify a date or the price of Cainiao\u2019s shares.  The Chinese e-commerce and cloud services giant will remain Cainiao\u2019s majority shareholder, though it will reduce its current 70% stake to a 50% holding, according to the filing. Cainiao will remain a subsidiary of Alibaba. Founded in 2013, Cainiao operates a global logistics network and provides delivery services for Alibaba and other firms. Its revenue rose 34% in the three months to the end of June compared with the same period in 2022, according to its IPO prospectus, published Tuesday.  The IPO announcement comes six months after Alibaba said it planned to split its business into six separate units, each overseen by its own chief executive and board of directors. The break-up would allow five of those units \u201cthe flexibility to raise outside capital and potentially to seek its own IPO,\u201d the company said in a statement at the time.  Alibaba is now beginning to follow through with the most ambitious restructuring in its 24-year history, under new leadership.  Eddie Wu, who became chief executive earlier this month, has said the company must embrace artificial intelligence, and promote younger people to senior management, to ensure it can continue to grow in the face of a challenging economic environment and rising competition. Cainiao\u2019s listing could provide a much-needed boost to Hong Kong\u2019s beleaguered IPO market. Once among the top five IPO destinations in the world based on the amount of equity raised, Hong Kong lost that status this year, according to data provider Dealogic.  Perris Lee, who focuses on Asian equity capital markets at Dealogic, told CNN in May that the city\u2019s IPO market had been held back by poor valuations and the legacy of strict Covid lockdowns.  \u2014 Michelle Toh contributed reporting.",

The current Blue Origin CEO, Bob Smith \u2014 a former Honeywell executive who took over the role in 2017 \u2014 will step down and make way for Dave Limp, the senior vice president of devices and services at Amazon, a spokesperson for Blue Origin said in a statement Monday. In the statement, Blue Origin said that Limp is \u201ca proven innovator with a customer-first mindset. He has extensive experience in the high-tech industry and growing highly complex organizations\u201d \u2014 including Amazon\u2019s satellite business, Project Kuiper. The company also noted that Smith has led Blue Origin\u2019s transformation from \u201can R&D-focused company into a multifaceted space business nearing $10 billion in customer orders and over 10,000 employees.\u201d Limp\u2019s first day at Blue Origin will be December 4, according to the company. However, Smith will stay on through January 2 \u201cto ensure a smooth transition,\u201d according to the statement. Blue Origin has worked for more than a decade to develop a suborbital rocket and spacecraft, called New Shepard, that is capable of taking paying customers and scientific experiments to the edge of space. The company\u2019s first successful crewed spaceflight carried Bezos as one of the passengers in 2021. New Shepard has since completed five additional missions with people on board. The vehicle, however, has not returned to flight since an uncrewed science mission in September 2022 ended in failure. Blue Origin has several other high-profile projects in the works. It is developing a heavy-lift rocket called New Glenn that is powerful enough to reach Earth\u2019s orbit, with the aim of competing with SpaceX for satellite launch contracts. The engines created for New Glenn, called BE-4, are also set to power the new Vulcan rocket under development by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture established by Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Blue Origin struggled to deliver the BE-4 engines, encountering months of delays. But ULA now expects the first launch of its BE-4-powered Vulcan Centaur rocket to happen this year, sending a NASA-backed spacecraft to the moon. Separately, Blue Origin won a long-awaited contract for NASA\u2019s moon exploration program \u2014 Artemis \u2014 in May, landing $3.5 billion to develop a spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts to the surface of the moon.",

            "text": "The \u201cface\u201d of the Hawaiian Airlines logo, which has decorated the tails of its airplanes for decades, has passed away. Leina\u2019ala Ann Teruya Drummond, Miss Hawaii 1964, died of cancer Monday at the age of 77 in Hilo, Hawaii. The Hawaiian native worked at the airline as a flight attendant when she was 18 and was later selected to become the \u201cface\u201d of the airlines logo, which is known as Pualani, or Hawaiian for \u201cflower of the sky.\u201d Hawaiian Airlines has used the vivid image since 1973 in a few variations, with the brand most recently giving it a refresh in 2017. The face is on the tail of its fleet of airplanes, which totals more than 50 and serves nearly 30 cities globally, making Drummond\u2019s profile instantly recognizable to many air travelers.  The face is a \u201cpromise to our guests that we offer something no other airline can \u2014 the warmth, care and generosity that are hallmarks of our Hawaiian culture,\u201d the airline explains its on website.  In a video about its 2017 makeover, employees affectionately describe their emotional connection to the logo and that it\u2019s \u201cnot just a picture of a woman with a flower, it\u2019s the way the Pulani sits on the plane \u2026 overlooks and watches over us.\u201d Hawaiian Airlines didn\u2019t immediately return CNN\u2019s request for comment.  The Miss Hawaii organization said in a statement that Drummond\u2019s \u201ciconic smile, elegance and grace will always be remembered\u201d and noted she placed in the top ten of the Miss America Pageant. \u201cHawaii lost a talented, poised and gracious woman who touched the hearts of many across the globe,\u201d the organization said.

            "title": "Toshiba is set to delist in Japan after 74 years as part of $14 billion deal",
            "text": "Toshiba said on Thursday that a $14 billion tender offer from private equity firm Japan Industrial Partners (JIP) had ended in success \u2014 a deal which paves the way for the embattled industrial conglomerate to go private. The JIP-led consortium saw 78.65% of Toshiba shares tendered, giving the group a majority of more than two-thirds which would be enough to squeeze out remaining shareholders. The deal puts the 148-year-old electronics-to-power stations maker in domestic hands after years of battles with overseas activist investors. Toshiba is set to be delisted as early as in December. \u201cActivist shareholders and Toshiba were stuck with each other for years. This takeover allows both sides to escape their mutual bearhug,\u201d said analyst Travis Lundy of Quiddity Advisors, who publishes on Smartkarma. Toshiba in March accepted the buyout offer valuing the industrial conglomerate at 2 trillion yen ($13.5 billion). Although some shareholders were unhappy with the price, Toshiba argued that there was no prospect of a higher offer or competing bid. \u201cWe are deeply grateful to many of our shareholders for being understanding of the company\u2019s position,\u201d Toshiba Chief Executive Taro Shimada said in a statement on Thursday.  Toshiba \u201cwill now take a major step toward a new future with a new shareholder,\u201d he added. Toshiba has said its complex relationships with various stakeholders, including shareholders with different opinions, have hampered business operations and that a stable shareholder base would help the company pursue its long-term strategy centered on high-margin digital services. JIP plans to retain CEO Shimada. \u201cI expect the prospect of management and new ownership alignment will improve morale. However, to succeed, management needs to be able to tell a better story to investors coming out of this,\u201d Lundy said. Although not well known overseas, JIP has been involved in corporate carve outs and spin offs from Japanese conglomerates, including Olympus\u2019s camera business and Sony Group\u2019s laptop computer business. Since 2015, Toshiba has been battered by accounting scandals, suffered heavy losses and came close to being delisted. It has also been engulfed in a series of corporate governance scandals. JIP\u2019s consortium includes 20 Japanese companies, led by chipmaker Rohm, financial services firm Orix and Chubu Electric Power. It will mark the largest M&A deal in Japan this year. Japan has been the only major market in Asia to have seen growth in mergers and acquisitions for the year to date, according to LSEG data. Deals involving private equity have been particularly active, including a planned $6.4 billion buyout of materials maker JSR by a government-backed fund.",

            "text": "After an F-35 fighter jet disappeared into the South Carolina sky, officials have found its debris field and launched an investigation into the \u201cmishap\u201d that forced its pilot to eject, according to the US Marine Corps and a defense official with knowledge of the search. The pilot ejected Sunday near Charleston and was taken to a local medical facility in stable condition, Joint Base Charleston said. But the fighter jet went missing. The jet\u2019s debris field \u2013 about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston \u2013 was discovered Monday after an extensive, multi-agency search from both the ground and air.  The F-35B Lightning II jet is described as \u201cthe most lethal, survivable and connected fighter jet in the world\u201d by Lockheed Martin. The jet costs about $100 million, said Russell Goemaere, spokesperson for the F-35 Joint Program Office. The entire F-35 program is on track to cost $1.7 trillion over the lifetime of the plane. It\u2019s not clear what prompted the pilot to eject Sunday.   \u201cThe mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,\u201d the Marines said in a statement Monday. Before the debris field was found, the military made an unusual plea to the public for help finding the F-35 jet, saying its last known position was near Lake Moultrie and Lake Marion, northwest of the city of Charleston.  Community members are now being asked to stay away from the fighter jet\u2019s remains while recovery crews work to secure the debris field in Williamsburg County. \u201cWe are transferring incident command to the USMC this evening, as they begin the recovery process,\u201d Joint Base Charleston posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. Marine Corps pauses flight operations It isn\u2019t the first notable incident involving military aircraft in recent weeks.  The Marine Corps ordered a two-day pause in flight operations Monday, citing three \u201cClass-A aviation mishaps\u201d over the past six weeks.  \u201cThis stand down is being taken to ensure the service is maintaining operational standardization of combat-ready aircraft with well-prepared pilots and crews,\u201d the Marine Corps said in a news release. While the Marine Corps\u2019 statement didn\u2019t detail the other two mishaps, there were two aviation incidents that happened in August. A pilot was killed on August 24 when a Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornet combat jet crashed near San Diego. The cause of the accident remains under investigation. Days later, a Marine Corps MV-22B Osprey crashed during military exercises in Australia, killing three US Marines and leaving five others in serious condition. That crash also remains under investigation. Though there is no indication of any connection between the crashes, all of the incidents are classified as Class-A mishaps by the Marine Corps \u2013 defined as an incident that leads to a fatality or more than $2.5 million in property damage.",

            "text": "The military temporarily losing a fighter jet near Charleston, South Carolina, and asking the public to help find it is a plotline in which \u201cTop Gun\u201d (fighter jets) meets \u201cThe Hunt for Red October\u201d (country can\u2019t find its weapons system). But the larger story of the F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter is like tax dollars meet \u201cThe Blob\u201d (unstoppable force consumes everything in its path). How in the heck? \u201cHow in the hell do you lose an F-35?\u201d wondered Rep. Nancy Mace, the South Carolina Republican, in a post on social media Sunday that speaks for everyone who read the headline about the state-of-the-art military plane that went missing earlier in the day after its pilot ejected and parachuted to safety. The debris field of the plane was located approximately two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston, the Marine Corps and a defense official with knowledge of the search told CNN Monday evening.  \u201cHow is there not a tracking device and we\u2019re asking the public to what, find a jet and turn it in?\u201d she continued. A more general and important question could be asked of the F-35 program writ large: How in the heck can you spend so much money on a plane that doesn\u2019t work the way it\u2019s supposed to? The most expensive US defense project ever The exact amount of money for a single aircraft like the one that went missing is somewhere around $100 million. The entire F-35 program is on track to cost $1.7 trillion over the lifetime of the plane. Trillion. With a \u201ct.\u201d Ahead of the discovery of its remains, CNN\u2019s Oren Liebermann reported the facts of what was known about the missing aircraft on CNN on Monday: But we\u2019re left with so many questions, he told CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto. \u201cWas the transponder working? If not, why wasn\u2019t it working? Why, maybe, had it been switched off? What was the mission it was on? All of this is either under investigation or a question we haven\u2019t gotten an answer to yet.\u201d In the meantime, Liebermann reported Monday evening that the Marine Corps has ordered a two-day pause in flight operations, during which all the aviation units within the service will review safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness. The F-35 incident marks the third plane crash for the service in six weeks.  When I asked Liebermann by email how to generally explain the F-35 program, he noted it is the most expensive weapons program in US history. For a country that spends a good portion of its income on its military and is known to have the most advanced fighting force on Earth, that\u2019s saying something. The F-35 is what\u2019s known as a \u201cstealth\u201d fighter, which means it is supposed to be able to avoid detection by enemies. Maybe a little too stealth.  But if you watch the glossy Lockheed Martin video at F35.com, the jet is also supposed to be able to communicate with rest of the military, \u201csharing its operational picture with the ground, sea and air assets.\u201d The video shows the jet beaming information to the ground and satellites. The New York Times\u2019 editorial board used the word \u201cboondoggle\u201d to describe the F-35 program in 2021. But it added that the US is essentially stuck with the program. Or as CNN\u2019s Zachary Cohen wrote back in 2015, \u201cIs the world\u2019s most expensive weapons program worth it?\u201d Eight years later, the question still applies. Many US allies \u2013 Canada, Germany, Japan and others \u2013 also buy F-35s from Lockheed. One jet to do many different things The F-35, as developed by Lockheed at the request of the US military, was supposed to be the jack-of-all-jets, with versions to do different jobs for the Air Force, the Navy and the Marines. The version that went missing over South Carolina \u2013 the F-35B \u2013 is used by the US Marine Corps and meant to be able to \u201cland vertically like a helicopter and take-off in very short distances,\u201d according to a fact sheet from Lockheed. Another F-35B crashed in 2018, also in South Carolina. The Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan watchdog group, has written extensively on the F-35 and its cost overruns. I asked Dan Grazier, an F-35 expert for POGO, what has gone wrong. \u2018Failure at the conceptual level\u2019 It all boils down to \u201cfailure at the conceptual level,\u201d he told me in an email. \u201cThe architects of the program attempted to build a single aircraft to meet multiple mission requirements for not just three separate services but also those of multiple countries,\u201d Grazier said, noting the difference between a small and nimble fighter jet and a long-range jet. \u201cWhen someone attempts to design a single aircraft to perform all of these roles, they have to make numerous design tradeoffs that generally results in an aircraft that can sort of do it all, but doesn\u2019t do anything particularly well.\u201d The jet has never reached its full operational capability and already needs updates and tweaks, including a new engine. \u201cEvery F-35 built until now is nothing more than a very expensive prototype,\u201d Grazier told me. \u201cAll of them will have to go through an expensive retrograde process in the future when the design is complete to bring them up to something approaching full combat standards.\u201d I asked a spokesperson for Lockheed Martin if the company is confident the jets perform as they should considering the taxpayer investment. They provided this statement: The global F-35 fleet has surpassed more than 721,000 cumulative flight hours and spans 17 nations and three U.S. military services. Since F-35s began flying 17 years ago, there has been one pilot fatality and less than 10 confirmed destroyed aircraft. More than 965 F-35s have been delivered and more than 430,000 sorties completed. Frequently grounded Diana Maurer is director of defense capabilities and management at the Government Accountability Office, the government\u2019s own watchdog that earlier this year described the F-35 program as \u201cmore than a decade behind schedule and $183 billion over original cost estimates.\u201d She said pilots frequently report being impressed by the plane\u2019s capabilities. But they also report not being able to fly it often enough. Problems getting spare parts, issues with repairs and a reliance on contractors all contribute to the F-35 having a substandard readiness and frequent groundings of the fleet. \u201cThere\u2019s a variety of reasons why they can\u2019t get these aircraft up in the air as often as they would like,\u201d Maurer said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really frustrating from a taxpayer perspective for something that already costs hundreds of millions of dollars a year; cost many, many multiple billions already; and will cost nearly $2 trillion over the life cycle of the program.\u201d Grazier said officials at the Pentagon have acknowledged problems with the F-35 that can be applied to the design process in the future. But this is a program that evolved over successive presidencies and with a rotating cast of characters in charge both in Congress and at the Pentagon. The system is supposed to have safeguards against extreme cost overruns, but when those warnings were triggered in previous decades, the F-35 program was allowed to barrel forward. And here we are. This story has been updated with additional information. ",

            "text": "The largest public offering since 2021 is here.  After a nearly two-year drought in the IPO market, UK-based chip designer Arm made a successful Nasdaq debut on Thursday, finishing the day 25% higher and landing the company with a market cap of around $65 billion.  The company started trading in New York on Thursday afternoon with 95.5 million shares under the ticker \u2018ARM\u2019 (ARM). Trading opened at $56 per share \u2014 already 10% above its initial price offering \u2014 and closed at $63.59. The strong open marks the largest initial public offering this year \u2014 and the biggest since electric truck maker Rivian in 2021. The Dow gained more than 330 points on Thursday, notching its best day since August as investors cheered the news.  SoftBank, which acquired Arm for $32 billion in 2016, will hold on to about 90% of the company\u2019s shares.    While many Americans likely haven\u2019t heard of Arm, most use the company\u2019s products daily. Apple (AAPL), Samsung, Nvidia (NVDA) and Google use Arm\u2019s designs and instructions to create their chips. The firm is essential in the production of smartphones, laptops, video games, televisions and GPS units.  Companies including Apple, Google, Nvidia, AMD, Samsung and TSMC have indicated interest in acting as cornerstone investors in the offering, according to a filing last week. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy about today,\u201d Arm CEO Rene Haas told CNN\u2019s Richard Quest on Thursday afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s a great day for the company\u2026Our bankers say if you can price at the high end of the range and go out of that number, it\u2019s a good thing. That\u2019s where we ended up and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased.\u201d Opening the pipeline Dealmaking has sunk to its lowest levels in over a decade as recessionary fears and high interest rates have shrunk valuations. Wall Street views Arm\u2019s listing as a weather balloon for a number of tech companies waiting to go public. Goldman Sachs (GS) reported this summer that its investment banking revenue declined by 20% in the second quarter of 2023. Overall, profit in the quarter fell by 58% from a year ago, to $1.2 billion.  \u201cActivity levels in many areas of investment banking hover near decade-long lows, and clients largely maintained a \u2018risk off\u2019 posture over the course of the quarter,\u201d said Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon on a recent earnings call. That means clients are worried about making bets in an uncertain economic environment. But experts say there are plenty of healthy companies waiting to make their public debut \u2014 they just don\u2019t want to be the first ones out.  A successful debut by Arm could be the big IPO that clears the pipeline for the rest.  \u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d said Dave Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar Research Services. \u201cThe big takeaway here for investors, even in the public markets, is that if this IPO is successful, that opens up the floodgates for a wave of new IPOs. That would provide a positive market sentiment for the overall stock market.\u201d Goldman Sachs is the lead underwriter in the IPO. Shares of the bank closed about 2.9% higher on Thursday. ",

            "text": "American Airlines said that rising costs, including fuel, will dent its upcoming profits. The Forth Worth-based carrier said in a regulatory filing that its adjusted earnings per share will now be between 20 cents to 30 cents in the third quarter, which is drastically smaller than the 95 cents a share the airline was previously forecasting.  American said that fuel prices have \u201cincreased considerably\u201d since July, when it issued its initial third-quarter guidance. The airline is paying about $3 per gallon for jet fuel. Oil prices surged 9.1% last month, according to the Labor Department\u2019s Consumer Price Index report that came out Wednesday. Another reason for the smaller profit is the new pilot contract. Earlier this summer, the airline inked a new deal with its pilots with about $9 billion dollars in incremental compensation and benefits. Also on Wednesday, discount carrier Spirit cut third quarter revenue by 5% from its previous forecast. It blamed rising fuel prices and \u201cheightened promotional activity with steep discounting for travel booked\u201d for the weeks leading into Thanksgiving weekend for the adjusted guidance.  Shares of American (AAL) and Spirit (SAVE) fell about 3% in premarket trading. Global airlines should make nearly $10 billion in profit this year as business bounces back from the pandemic, according to a recent forecast from the International Air Transport Association. The organization said in June that it more than doubled its 2023 profit forecast for the global airline industry despite a looming economic downturn.  Airlines are expected to make $9.8 billion in net profit in 2023, up from a December forecast of $4.7 billion. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby previously told CNN that he expected the carrier to return to 2019 levels of profitability this year. The airline was holding a lot more cash on its balance sheet, however, to withstand a potential economic downturn in the near term. \u201cWe\u2019ve dramatically improved our relative and absolute profit margins and we\u2019re starting to pay down debt and that gives us the firepower to really ride through a short term recession,\u201d Kirby said.",

            "text": "Alibaba Group will embrace artificial intelligence (AI) and promote younger people to senior management, its new CEO says, as the e-commerce and cloud giant tackles its most ambitious restructuring in its history. \u201cTimes are changing, and so must Alibaba!\u201d Eddie Wu, who stepped into the chief executive role on Sunday, said in a memo to staff seen by CNN. Wu replaced Daniel Zhang to become Alibaba\n            \n                (BABA)\u2019s fourth CEO in its 24-year history. He also took over as head of the cloud division after Zhang\u2019s surprise exit from the unit. In Tuesday\u2019s memo, Wu laid out his long-term goals for the company, which are seeking new growth points amid a challenging economic environment and growing competition from rivals. \u201cLooking forward, Alibaba\u2019s two main strategic focuses will be \u2018User First\u2019 and \u2018AI-driven,\u2019 he said. \u201cWe will recalibrate our operations around these two core strategies and reshape our business priorities.\u201d \u201cOver the next decade, the most significant change agent will be the disruptions brought about by AI across all sectors,\u201d he added. \u201cIf we don\u2019t keep up with the changes of the AI era, we will be displaced.\u201d  The revelation of the company\u2019s strategy comes as it tackles its biggest ever restructuring. According to a plan announced in March, Alibaba will split into six separate units, including cloud, e-commerce, logistics, media and entertainment. Each unit will be overseen by its own CEO and board of directors, and most of them will have the option of pursuing separate listings or fundraising. The business environment has also become tougher for one of China\u2019s most valuable internet companies.  China\u2019s economy is slowing, with consumers holding back on spending. E-commerce companies like Alibaba are under pressure to offer more discounted goods to entice customers.  The company is facing rising competition from major online rivals including Pinduoduo\n            \n                (PDD) and Bytedance-owned Douyin, a short video app with a strong live shopping business. Wu said Alibaba achieved rapid growth over the past 24 years by \u201criding the trend of internet technology.\u201d  But it must \u201ctransform\u201d itself to \u201cfind the key to the future\u201d as traditional internet models become increasingly homogeneous and new technologies like AI emerge as the new engine of global business growth. Furthermore, Alibaba will make its leadership team younger. It is aiming to promote those born after 1985 to form \u201cthe core of its business management team\u201d within the next four years, he added. Alibaba will reinforce its strategic investments in three areas: technology-driven internet platforms, AI-driven tech businesses and global commerce networks, he said. Furthermore, it will also seek \u201copen and collaborative relationships,\u201d including with companies that it traditionally has considered as competitors. Top tech firms around the globe have been shifting their focus to AI, including Google\n            \n                (GOOG), Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN) and Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT), especially after ChatGPT took the world by storm late last year.",

            "text": "Tesla\u2019s Dojo supercomputer could fuel a $500 billion jump in the electric vehicle maker\u2019s market value, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note Monday.  Shares of Tesla jumped more than 6% during early trading Monday morning, on the heels of the rosy prediction from Morgan Stanley\u2019s team about the automaker\u2019s supercomputing efforts. The Morgan Stanley team, lead by longtime Tesla analyst Adam Jonas, predicted that the massive drive in value could come from Dojo potentially unlocking new revenue streams through the wider adoption of robotaxis and software services.  The analysts compared the potential of Dojo at Tesla to the \u201csame forces that have driven\u201d Amazon Web Services to propel Amazon\u2019s profitability to new heights.  \u201cInvestors have long debated whether Tesla is an auto company or a tech company. We believe it\u2019s both, but see the biggest value driver from here being software and services revenue,\u201d the note stated.  Dojo, an in-house supercomputer that has been in the works at Tesla for some five years, is designed to train AI systems to complete complex tasks like assisting Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance system Autopilot as well as help propel its \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d efforts.  The Morgan Stanley analysts see Dojo as being able to open up \u201cnew addressable markets that extend well beyond selling vehicles at a fixed price.\u201d The analysts added that the latest version of Tesla\u2019s full self-driving system (expected to be unveiled at the end of the year) and Tesla\u2019s next AI day (expected in early 2024, but yet to be announced) will be \u201cworth watching.\u201d Shares of Tesla have doubled since the beginning of the year, but are still far off from the all-time intraday high of $414.50 hit in November 2021. The world\u2019s most valuable carmaker had a market cap of some $788.74 billion as of the market close on Friday. ",

            "title": "Former Alibaba CEO quits cloud unit in surprise move amid landmark restructuring",
            "text": "Daniel Zhang, the outgoing chairman and CEO of Alibaba, has stepped down from his position running the company\u2019s cloud division in a surprise move announced just months after he assumed the pivotal role. Alibaba\u2019s stock tumbled 3% on Monday in Hong Kong following the announcement. Zhang will now fully exit the Chinese tech giant\u2019s core management team as it undertakes its biggest ever restructuring amid a worsening downturn in the world\u2019s second largest economy. Just three months ago, Zhang, 51, said that a key reason he wanted to step down as company chief was because he needed to focus on the spin-off of its cloud business. \u201cWe were surprised by the announcement,\u201d Citi analysts wrote on Monday. \u201cMr Zhang may have wanted to step back from the public spotlight, in our view,\u201d they added without elaborating.   Eddie Yongming Wu will succeed Zhang as acting chairman and CEO of its cloud unit, Alibaba said Monday.  \u201cThe company will continue to execute its previously announced plan to spin off Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group under a separate management team to be appointed,\u201d it said in a stock exchange filing.  In May, Alibaba announced it aimed to complete the spinoff of its cloud unit in the next 12 months and intended to make it an independent publicly listed company. Joseph C Tsai, a company co-founder, has assumed the role of chairman of Alibaba Group, while Wu has taken up the position of chief executive officer and director, Alibaba said, saying the company\u2019s leadership transition had been completed. It comes as one of China\u2019s most iconic companies undergoes a historic overhaul amid an economic slowdown and an ongoing campaign by the Chinese government to reduce what it calls the \u201cmonopolistic nature\u201d of internet companies. In an internal letter to employees obtained by CNN, Tsai said he and Wu look forward to embracing \u201cthe next phase\u201d of Alibaba\u2019s development. \u201cThis past March, we embarked on our most ambitious reorganization in Alibaba\u2019s 24-year history \u2014 \u201c1+6+N\u201d \u2014 in order to position the company for the future,\u201d he wrote on Sunday, referring to Alibaba\u2019s organizational structure after the restructuring \u2014 1 holding company, six business groups and various businesses.  \u201cUnder Daniel\u2019s and our team\u2019s dedicated efforts, the reorganization is making steady progress while our business continues to grow.\u201d Tsai is also the owner of Brooklyn Nets and New York Liberty, and is the chairman of South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong-based newspaper owned by Alibaba Group.  Significant restructuring In March, Alibaba announced it would split into six separate units, including cloud, e-commerce, logistics, media and entertainment. Each unit would be overseen by its own CEO and board of directors, and most of them would be able to pursue separate listings or fundraisings. It was the \u201cmost significant governance overhaul\u201d in the company\u2019s history, Alibaba said at the time. The restructuring was perceived by analysts to be an effort by Alibaba to align with Beijing\u2019s desire to break up monopolies and curb the influence of tech firms. Analysts said Zhang\u2019s departure from the cloud business came as a surprise, but should not affect a potential IPO of the unit.  \u201cOur understanding is today\u2019s news doesn\u2019t impact progress for the cloud division\u2019s spin-off and IPO, or for the broader reorganization,\u201d said Jacob Cooke, co-founder and CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies. Alibaba\u2019s most recent quarterly earnings \u201cwere very strong,\u201d with overall revenue up 14% compared to the previous year and domestic e-commerce revenue up 12%. \u201cDespite economic headwinds, Chinese e-commerce sales continue to perform well, and the regulatory pressure Alibaba previously faced has been lifted,\u201d he noted.  Tsai said in the letter that Zhang had expressed his wish to transition away from his role as chairman and CEO of the cloud unit. \u201cFollowing careful consideration, the Alibaba board respected and accepted Daniel\u2019s decision,\u201d he said.  Zhang will establish a technology fund with a $1 billion investment from Alibaba, which will support the parent firm\u2019s strategy of investing for future growth and developing the company\u2019s technology ecosystem, Tsai said in his letter. Zhang has worked at Alibaba for 16 years, during which he created the Singles Day shopping festival, which has become China\u2019s biggest online shopping event.  He also guided teams to \u201ctransition our business from desktop to mobile\u201d and confronted myriad challenges with a \u201csteady hand,\u201d including the Covid-19 pandemic and dramatic changes in the larger business environment, Tsai said.",

            "text": "The Federal Aviation Administration announced Friday it has closed its \u201cmishap\u201d investigation into the April SpaceX Starship test flight that ended after the rocket exploded over the Gulf of Mexico. But the regulatory agency still hasn\u2019t given the green light for the next launch. The FAA says the investigation \u201ccites multiple root causes\u201d and \u201c63 corrective actions SpaceX must take to prevent mishap reoccurrence,\u201d the agency said in a statement. SpaceX has said it is ready to try to launch Starship again. The rocket is currently stacked on its launchpad in Boca Chica, Texas. But the FAA must issue a launch license, and one of the holdups has been the mishap investigation. However, conclusion of the investigation isn\u2019t an automatic green light. The FAA said in its statement, \u201cThe closure of the mishap investigation does not signal an immediate resumption of Starship launches at Boca Chica.\u201d The agency says SpaceX must complete the actions \u201cthat impact public safety and apply for and receive a license modification from the FAA that addresses all safety, environmental and other applicable regulatory requirements prior to the next Starship launch.\u201d FAA is not releasing the report publicly because it contains information that is proprietary to SpaceX, as well as information that is constrained by U.S. Export Control laws, according to the agency. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk previously confirmed on September 5 that, from SpaceX\u2019s perspective, the Starship vehicle was \u201cready to launch.\u201d This announcement came nearly five months after the Starship explosion, which took place about four minutes after its first test flight lifted off from SpaceX\u2019s sprawling Starbase in Boca Chica.\u00a0The company blamed the outcome, which it called a \u201crapid unscheduled disassembly,\u201d on multiple engine failures. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment, nor does the company typically respond to reporter inquiries.\u00a0The April launch of Starship damaged the launchpad and renewed environmental concerns after starting a 3.5-acre fire on Boca Chica State Park land. \u201cImpacts from the launch include numerous large concrete chunks, stainless steel sheets, metal and other objects hurled thousands of feet away along with a plume cloud of pulverized concrete that deposited material up to 6.5 miles northwest of the pad site,\u201d the US Fish and Wildlife Service said in April. The timing of Starship\u2019s return to test flights is significant for a separate federal agency, NASA, which is counting on Starship to return American astronauts to the surface of the moon for the first time in more than half a century. The mission, called Artemis III, is scheduled to lift off as soon as December 2025, but Jim Free, associate administrator of NASA\u2019s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, said in June that he\u2019s worried the date will slide due to Starship\u2019s delays. \u201cWith the difficulties that SpaceX has had, I think that\u2019s really concerning,\u201d Free said while speaking to a joint meeting of the Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board and Space Studies Board of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.\u00a0\u201cYou can think about that launch date slipping probably into \u201926.\u201d In August, Free told CNN \u201cmy level of concern is the same\u201d after a trip to visit SpaceX\u2019s launch site a month earlier.",

Arm, which designs chips for 99% of the world\u2019s smartphones, is aiming to price its shares between $47 and $51 each when they hit the US stock market later this month. The firm\u2019s Japanese owner SoftBank is hoping to raise as much as $4.9 billion when Arm starts trading on the Nasdaq, according to a Tuesday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That could rise to $5.2 billion if the banks underwriting the IPO exercise an option to buy additional shares from SoftBank.  Many of the biggest names in global tech, including Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), TSMC (TSM), Samsung and Intel (INTC) have all indicated an interest in acting as cornerstone investors, and could buy shares worth up to $735 million collectively in the IPO. The Cambridge-based firm develops microchips for phones and tablets and licenses them to CPU makers, including Apple and Samsung. The company was public until 2016, when Japan\u2019s SoftBank bought it for $32 billion.  In 2020, SoftBank tried to offload Arm to Nvidia for $40 billion, in what would have been the biggest chip deal of all time. But it didn\u2019t pass muster with global antitrust regulators, and was called off in February 2022. Still, if the IPO values Arm at $52 billion, that would represent a retreat from the valuation of about $64 billion implied by SoftBank\u2019s purchase of the remaining 25% stake in the company from its Vision Fund unit for approximately $16.1 billion just last month. Smartphone sales have been on the decline as hardware innovation slows down and customers hold onto their devices for longer stretches of time. The company\u2019s return to the public market is being closely watched as it promises to be the biggest US IPO since 2021. It\u2019s also expected to be the world\u2019s largest IPO in about a year, since Porsche raised about $8.7 billion in a Frankfurt offering last September, according to data from Dealogic. Arm made nearly $2.7 billion in revenue in the fiscal year ended March, according to its prospectus.  SoftBank will continue to own approximately 90% of Arm\u2019s shares following the listing, according to the filing.",

Joyce\u2019s early retirement will see CEO Designate Vanessa Hudson, the first woman to lead the century-old airline, take charge on Wednesday. The accelerated departure comes after Qantas on Monday apologized for its service standards falling short and acknowledged it was suffering reputational damage, less than two weeks after it reported record annual earnings underpinned by strong travel demand. Australia\u2019s competition regulator last week sued it for allegedly selling tickets for more than 8,000 canceled flights between May and July 2022 without disclosing they had been canceled. The airline had also faced scrutiny from politicians and the public over a decision to let nearly 500 million Australian dollars ($323.00 million) of pandemic-era flight credits expire by the end of the year, which it reversed shortly after the regulator filed its lawsuit. Controversies involving Qantas, including the granting of a premium airport lounge membership to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s son and its opposition to Qatar Airways adding additional flights to Australia, have led to many recent newspaper headlines and editorials in the country. The airline\u2019s share price had also taken a battering, falling 13% since the start of August amid questions over whether it had maximized profits at the expense of its longer-term reputation with customers. \u201cIn the last few weeks, the focus on Qantas and events of the past make it clear to me that the company needs to move ahead with its renewal as a priority,\u201d said Joyce, who served as the airline\u2019s CEO for 15 years. Chairman Richard Goyder said the executive transition came at a \u201cchallenging time\u201d for the airline and its staff. \u201cWe have an important job to do in restoring the public\u2019s confidence in the kind of company we are, and that\u2019s what the board is focused on, and what the management under Vanessa\u2019s leadership will do,\u201d Goyder said in a statement. Qantas had announced a raft of leadership changes in June in a bid to increase focus on key areas as the airline completes its post-pandemic recovery. The airline said newly appointed Chief Financial Officer Rob Marcolina will also start early alongside Hudson. ",

The NTSB tweet said that a preliminary report on Delta flight 175 would be expected in two to three weeks. The Federal Aviation Administration says a total of 12 people, one more than initially reported, were hurt in the incident. That agency\u2019s initial report says one member of the flight crew sustained serious injuries. Also, three cabin crew members and eight passengers had minor injuries, it said. The flight was about 40 miles northeast of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport when the turbulence occurred, and it eventually landed safely, according to the FAA. In a 2021 report, the NTSB found that \u201cturbulence-related accidents are the most common type of accident involving air carriers.\u201d Passenger describes Delta flight Passenger\u00a0Ay\u1ecd Suber described what happened on the plane earlier this week. The first 10 hours of the flight were fine, she said, but when they got close to Atlanta, the turbulence struck. \u201cIt was severe turbulence and then the plane just dropped straight down,\u201d Suber told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s when I thought we were crashing.\u201d A woman sitting in the middle aisle flew out of her seat and the top of her head hit the overhead storage bins, said Suber. \u201cThere was a woman who kept crying and saying she\u2019s scared,\u201d she added. Suber said passengers were informed by the cockpit that medics would be standing by once the plane landed. In a video taken by Suber, a crack can be seen on the bottom of a storage bin where a woman hit her head. After the plane landed, medics could be seen taking some passengers off the aircraft on stretchers. Suber, who flies frequently, told CNN this terrifying experience will not keep her from flying. \u201cI felt like this was such a freak incident that I\u2019m not scared to fly,\u201d she said.

            "text": "Toyota will resume operations at its Japanese assembly plants Wednesday after a 24-hour stoppage caused by disruption to its finely-tuned supply chain.  The world\u2019s biggest automaker by sales said that its 14 vehicle factories in the country had paused activity Tuesday because a system malfunction that began on Monday was preventing it from processing orders for automotive components. Production is expected to be back to normal at all 14 plants in Japan from the start of the second shift on Wednesday, the company said in a statement.  \u201cIt is our understanding that the malfunction of the system was not caused by a cyberattack. However, we will continue to investigate the cause,\u201d Toyota (TM) said. \u201cWe would like to apologize once again to our customers, suppliers, and related parties for any inconvenience caused by the suspension of operations.\u201d Toyota was a pioneer of \u201cjust-in-time\u201d production, which is based on the delivery of component parts to assembly plants in the right quantities just before they are required. The system saves warehouse space and money but is vulnerable to disruption if any link in the chain is broken. It was not immediately clear how much output has been lost. Together, Toyota\u2019s plants in Japan account for approximately a third of the automaker\u2019s global production, according to Reuters calculations. Toyota delivered almost 10.5 million cars last year. By comparison, Volkswagen (VLKAF), which usually competes with the Japanese company for the global sales crown, sold 8.3 million vehicles in 2022. Last year, Toyota was forced to shut down Japanese production after a cyberattack on one of its suppliers led to a system failure and a similar issue obtaining automotive parts. The suspension lasted for one day. ",

Nvidia (NVDA) has surged 222% this year, including a 3% bump Thursday following super impressive earnings. Although it\u2019s been known for graphics processors, Nvidia has now become almost synonymous with AI, after successfully diving head-first into the production of the type of microchip that powers the promising technology.  Demand has outpaced supply, making Nvidia the hottest of hot stocks: It\u2019s leading the S&P 500 this year by a mile, and is now one of only a handful of companies with a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion.  Investor enthusiasm for AI has also helped boost other tech stocks. Meta is up 144% this year, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has grown 31%. But Nvidia is by far the most sought-after AI stock. The American chipmaker produces the building blocks of generative artificial intelligence (think ChatGPT and the like).  The Santa Clara, California-based company posted year-over-year sales growth of 101% in the second quarter. Revenue went from $6.7 billion in the second quarter last year to $13.5 billion this year. The results were even stronger than the $11.2 billion in revenue that Wall Street analysts expected. This is the second time in a row that Nvidia\u2019s quarterly earnings have blown past expectations. Its success is beginning to provide assurances that the AI gold rush is not just a flash in the pan.  AI enthusiasm has helped power stocks into a bull market, even as the Federal Reserve has continued to hike interest rates in its battle against inflation. \u201cNvidia\u2019s hardware has become indispensable to the AI-driven economy,\u201d Insider Intelligence senior analyst Jacob Bourne said in an email following the blockbuster earnings report. \u201cThe pressing question is whether Nvidia can consistently exceed the now-higher expectations.\u201d It shouldn\u2019t have too much let-up: Demand for generative AI will remain robust over the next two years as apps for the new technology explode and become broadly deployed across companies, said Raj Joshi, senior vice president for Moody\u2019s Investors Service, in a note to investors.

            "text": "Yevgeny Prigozhin, the chief of Russian mercenary group Wagner who staged a short-lived mutiny against Russia\u2019s military leadership in June, was on board a plane that crashed northwest of Moscow on Wednesday, the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency said. \u201cAn investigation has been launched into the crash of the Embraer aircraft, which occurred tonight in the Tver region,\u201d the Federal Air Transport Agency said in a statement, according to the official state news agency TASS. \u201cAccording to the list of passengers, among them is the name and surname of Yevgeny Prigozhin.\u201d There were seven passengers and three crew members on board the private Embraer jet when it crashed near the village of Kuzhenkino, in the Tver region, on Wednesday, according to the Russian Ministry of Emergency Services. All on board were killed, according to preliminary information, the ministry said, adding that they \u201care conducting search operations.\u201d Among those on the plane were Dmitriy Utkin, a trusted lieutenant of Prigozhin\u2019s since Wagner was formed, and Prigozhin\u2019s senior aide Valeriy Chekalov, according to list of passengers shared by the Russian aviation agency.  The bodies of eight people have been found at the crash site, state media outlet Russia 24 reported. Earlier, TASS reported the plane \u201cburned up\u201d on impact after being in the air for about half an hour. Russian investigators have initiated a criminal case following the crash. The Russian Investigative Committee said that a team was on the way to the scene to \u201cestablish the causes of the crash.\u201d The crash comes months after Prigozhin launched a brief rebellion that posed an unprecedented challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s authority before it was suddenly called off in a deal that required the Wagner chief and his fighters to relocate to Belarus. Wagner forces were heavily involved in capturing the eastern Ukrainian cities of Soledar and Bakhmut following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year. Prigozhin then spent months criticizing Russian military leadership and the support it was giving his troops before he called for the armed rebellion.  A senior Ukrainian official told CNN on Wednesday that the plane that crashed north of Moscow \u201cis a manifestation of Putin\u2019s Russia.\u201d \u201cThis is why we are fighting, we don\u2019t want to be a part of Putin\u2019s world,\u201d the senior official, who is close to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said. US President Joe Biden suggested Putin may have been behind the crash. \u201cYou may recall, I was asked about this,\u201d Biden told CNN. \u201cI said I would be careful what I rode in. I don\u2019t know for a fact what happened, but I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d As news of the crash broke, Putin was taking part in an event hundreds of miles away from the site, in the Kursk region, to mark the anniversary of the Soviet Union\u2019s victory over Nazi Germany there.  Video shows plane falling out of sky  Video published by Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti showed a plane falling out of the sky with one wing missing. CNN is unable to confirm the authenticity of the video, but RIA Novosti claimed it was the moment that an Embraer jet fell from the sky over the Tver region. A separate video, also released by RIA Novosti, purports to show plane engine debris at the crash site. Visible on the still-burning engine debris are the last four digits of a registration number: 2795. Prigozhin\u2019s plane is registered as RA-02795.   Flight data shows the Prigozhin-linked plane reached an altitude of some 28,000 feet before publicly available flight tracking data suddenly stopped transmitting, soon after 6 p.m. local time, southwest of the city of Tver. Tracking site FlightRadar24 told CNN it is still analyzing data that is \u201clikely incomplete,\u201d due to the way flight data near Moscow is collected. CNN has previously reported on the plane, which has been linked to Prigozhin\u2019s companies and the Wagner Group. The plane is believed to have previously ferried Prigozhin from Rostov-on-Don \u2013 which became the headquarters for his short-lived mutiny in June \u2013 to Moscow, St. Petersburg and Belarus. The Embraer Legacy 600 is a corporate jet based on the ERJ 145 regional airliner used by airlines in the United States. \u2018Russia has an open windows policy\u2019 Top Biden administration officials have repeatedly and publicly warned that Prigozhin could be killed by the Kremlin in the aftermath of the halted rebellion.  \u201cIf I were he I\u2019d be careful what I ate. I\u2019d keep my eye on my menu,\u201d President Biden said in July. CIA Director Bill Burns and Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed Biden\u2019s sentiments, with Burns noting that Putin has a long history of payback. \u201cIn my experience, Putin is the ultimate apostle of payback. So I would be surprised if Prigozhin escapes further retribution for this. So in that sense, the president\u2019s right. If I were Prigozhin, I wouldn\u2019t fire my food taster,\u201d Burns said later in July. \u201cIf I were Mr. Prigozhin, I would remain very concerned. NATO has an open-door policy; Russia has an open-windows policy,\u201d Blinken also said in July.   For years Prigozhin was an elusive figure, growing wealthy in the chaos and opportunity of the post-Soviet Russian economy.  His transformation from wealthy oligarch into a brutal warlord came in the aftermath of the 2014 Russian-backed separatist movement in the Donbas in eastern Ukraine. Prigozhin founded Wagner that year as a mercenary outfit that fought both in Ukraine and, increasingly, for Russian-backed causes around the world. He long denied his connection to the shadowy outfit, despite evidence to the contrary. He was thrust into the spotlight through Wagner\u2019s close involvement in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, securing rare victories for the Kremlin. But he fell foul of Russian authorities on launching the armed insurrection against Putin two months ago to the day on June 23, after railing against the country\u2019s military brass over their handling of the Ukraine war. Criminal charges were dropped against the Wagner boss, but Putin said in a speech at the time that those on the \u201cpath of treason\u201d would face punishment.",

These upcoming planes want to be the next generation of sustainable flight \u2013 and also to look good when doing it. First there\u2019s the X-66A, which NASA has been cooking up along with Boeing as part of its Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project. The US aerospace behemoths want to build, test and fly an emission-reducing, single-aisle aircraft before the decade is out. The X-66A is the full-scale demonstrator on which they\u2019ll be doing all that. \u201cIt\u2019s our goal that NASA\u2019s partnership with Boeing to produce and test a full-scale demonstrator will help lead to future commercial airliners that are more fuel efficient, with benefits to the environment, the commercial aviation industry, and to passengers worldwide, \u201c said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson in a statement in January. \u201cIf we are successful, we may see these technologies in planes that the public takes to the skies in the 2030s.\u201d The design that NASA and Boeing are working on could reduce fuel consumption and emissions by up to 30% compared with today\u2019s most efficient aircraft, according to the agency. It\u2019s called the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing concept, which relies on elongated, thin wings stabilized by diagonal struts that connect the wings to the aircraft. The design\u2019s shape creates less drag, which means burning less fuel. The new livery was unveiled at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh and features a white body with a blue, orange and red striped tail. \u2018An experimental aircraft\u2019 \u201cThis is an experimental aircraft,\u201d Bob Pearce, NASA associate administrator for the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, said in January.\u00a0 \u201cThis is not a commercial development of an aircraft that passengers are going to fly in today. And the reason we need to do this is because this is high-risk technology. We\u2019re trying to validate technology.\u201d The first test flight of this full-scale demonstrator is set to take place in 2028. NASA hopes that one day the technology should serve about half of the commercial market through short- to medium-haul single-aisle aircraft. Airlines largely rely on single-aisle aircraft, which account for nearly half of aviation emissions worldwide, according to NASA. Boeing estimates that the demand for the new single-aisle aircraft will increase by 40,000 planes between 2035 and 2050. The goal is for the technology to serve about 50% of the commercial market through short- to medium-haul, single-aisle aircraft, Nelson said. The other planes to get a new look are the hybrid electric aircraft that GE Aerospace and magniX are developing as part of NASA\u2019s Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration (EPFD) project. The project\u2019s goal is to enable a new generation of electric-powered aircraft. NASA is collaborating with industry partners on new technologies including lighter and more efficient motors, electronics and materials that can help improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. More flight testing to come These technologies will be tested and demonstrated in modified existing aircraft. A souped-up Saab 340B, with white and blue livery, with be used for ground and test flights on a megawatt-class hybrid electric powertrain being developed by GE Aerospace. (A powertrain, for the uninitiated, is the system that brings together all the components to drive a vehicle forward). NASA says the flights will take place by the middle of this decade. A modified DeHavilland \u201cDash 7\u201d aircraft, with red and white livery, is home to magniX\u2019s hybrid powertrain, and it\u2019s partnering with AeroTEC and Air Tindi on test flights. It\u2019s hoped the project eventually will benefit short-haul turboprop aircraft \u2013 the type that carry between 30 and 70 passengers \u2013 as well as regional, single-aisle commercial airliners carrying up to 180 passengers. NASA says it plans to conduct at least two flight demonstrations within the next five years so the new technologies can be introduced commercially in the United States between 2030 and 2035.",

            "title": "JetZero: Is this new plane design the future of aviation?",
            "text": "The basic design of commercial airplanes hasn\u2019t changed much in the past 60 years. Modern airliners like the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350 have the same general shape as the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8, which were built in the late 1950s and solidified the \u201ctube and wing\u201d form factor that is still in use today. This is because commercial aviation prioritizes safety, favoring tried-and-tested solutions, and because other developments \u2014 in materials and engines, for example \u2014 mean the traditional design is still relevant. However, as the industry desperately looks for ways to reduce carbon emissions, it faces a somewhat tougher challenge than other sectors precisely because its core technologies have proven so hard to move away from. The time might be ripe to try something new. One proposal is the \u201cblended wing body.\u201d This entirely new aircraft shape looks similar to the \u201cflying wing\u201d design used by military aircraft such as the iconic B-2 bomber, but the blended wing has more volume in the middle section. Both Boeing and Airbus are tinkering with the idea, and so is a third player, California-based JetZero, which has set an ambitious goal of putting into service a blended wing aircraft as soon as 2030. \u201cWe feel very strongly about a path to zero emissions in big jets, and the blended wing airframe can deliver 50% lower fuel burn and emissions,\u201d says Tom O\u2019Leary, co-founder and CEO of JetZero. \u201cThat is a staggering leap forward in comparison to what the industry is used to.\u201d Under pressure The blended wing concept is far from new, and the earliest attempts at building airplanes with this design date back to the late 1920s in Germany. American aircraft designer and industrialist Jack Northrop created a jet-powered flying wing design in 1947, which inspired the B-2 in the 1990s. As a sort of hybrid between a flying wing and a traditional \u201ctube and wing,\u201d the blended wing allows the entire aircraft to generate lift, minimizing drag. NASA says that this shape \u201chelps to increase fuel economy and creates larger payload (cargo or passenger) areas in the center body portion of the aircraft.\u201d The agency has tested it through one of its experimental planes, the X-48. Over about 120 test flights between 2007 and 2012, two unmanned, remote-controlled X-48s demonstrated the viability of the concept. \u201cAn aircraft of this type would have a wingspan slightly greater than a Boeing 747 and could operate from existing airport terminals,\u201d the agency says, adding that the plane would also \u201cweigh less, generate less noise and emissions, and cost less to operate than an equally advanced conventional transport aircraft.\u201d In 2020, Airbus built a small blended wing demonstrator, about six feet in length, signaling interest in pursuing a full-size aircraft in the future. But if the shape is so effective, why haven\u2019t we yet moved to building planes based on it? According to O\u2019Leary, there is one main technical challenge holding manufacturers back. \u201cIt\u2019s the pressurization of a non-cylindrical fuselage,\u201d he says, pointing to the fact that a tube-shaped plane is better able to handle the constant expansion and contraction cycles that come with each flight. \u201cIf you think about a \u2018tube and wing,\u2019 it separates the loads \u2014 you have the pressurization load on the tube, and the bending loads on the wings. But a blended wing essentially blends those together. Only now can we do that with composite materials that are both light and strong.\u201d Such a radically new shape would make the interior of the plane look and feel wildly different to today\u2019s widebody aircraft. \u201cIt\u2019s just a much, much wider fuselage,\u201d O\u2019Leary says. \u201cYour typical single-aisle plane has three by three seats, but this is a sort of a shorter, wider tube. You get the same amount of people, but you might have 15 or 20 rows across the cabin, depending upon how each particular airline will configure it. \u201cThis just gives them a whole new palette with which to lay it out. I think it\u2019s going to be amazing to see what their interpretation of this much broader space will be.\u201d Revolutionary potential O\u2019Leary says that the nearest equivalent in terms of size would be the Boeing 767 \u2013 a widebody, twin-engine plane introduced in the 1980s that typically carried around 210 passengers. It\u2019s still produced as a cargo plane but was replaced by the Boeing 787 as a passenger aircraft. It also has a modern military variant, the KC-46, which the US Air Force uses for aerial refueling. Similarly, JetZero wants to simultaneously develop three variants: a passenger plane, a cargo plane and a fuel tanker. The blended wing shape lends itself so well to the latter that the US Air Force has just awarded JetZero $235 million to develop a full-scale demonstrator and validate the performance of the blended wing concept. First flight is expected by 2027, which means the military version of the plane is scheduled to lead the way and perhaps support the development of the commercial models. However, building an entirely new airplane from scratch is an enormous task, and JetZero\u2019s targets sound ambitious, given that the full process of certification for even a variant of an existing aircraft can take years. One advantage JetZero has in this area is that the plane will initially borrow engines from today\u2019s narrowbody aircraft, like the Boeing 737 \u2014 although the plan is to eventually move to completely emission-free propulsion powered by hydrogen, which would require new engines that haven\u2019t yet been developed. JetZero doesn\u2019t have any orders for its plane yet, but O\u2019Leary says airlines are interested. \u201cWe\u2019re talking to all the major airlines globally already, because they\u2019re excited to hear about the efficiency gains.\u201d It remains to be seen whether a 50% reduction in fuel use is actually possible. Both NASA and Airbus quoted a more modest 20% for their designs, while the US Air Force says a blended wing aircraft could \u201cimprove aerodynamic efficiency by at least 30% over current Air Force tanker and mobility aircraft.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that while a blended wing body can reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency, the actual benefits depend on the specific design, configuration, and operational conditions,\u201d says Bailey Miles, an aviation analyst at consulting firm AviationValues. \u201cExtensive aerodynamic testing and optimization are essential to fully realize the drag reduction potential of this innovative aircraft design. It would be hard to determine a specific percentage fuel reduction without the necessary tests,\u201d he adds. According to \ufeffMiles, the blended wing design is a \u201crevolutionary\u201d idea that has potential, but it comes with a number of hurdles, specifically an increased aerodynamic complexity that can make design and testing tricky, a series of regulatory and certification challenges, and a shape that may not be suitable for existing airport infrastructure. \u201cThe blended wing body aircraft holds immense promise as a game changer in the aviation industry, offering the potential for improved fuel efficiency, enhanced payload capacity, and innovative control systems. However, addressing the aerodynamic complexities, ensuring structural integrity, navigating regulatory hurdles, and adapting airport infrastructure are formidable challenges that must be overcome for it to become a reality,\u201d he says, adding that these challenges, among others, make JetZero\u2019s target of 2030 for entry into service \u201cinconceivable.\u201d According to Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at consulting firm Aerodynamic Advisory, while not all of JetZero\u2019s claims can be verified, \u201cthe idea of a blended wing body has been quite appealing for years, and it sounds like they\u2019ve done some very interesting research. My colleagues and I regard it as quite promising.\u201d He is concerned that the firm is mostly \u201ca design shop\u201d at the moment, but he believes that the project may take off with the help of contractors. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly room for somebody who actually wants to add value in this industry,\u201d he says.

            "text": "Intel has pulled out of a major acquisition of an Israeli chipmaker after failing to obtain the required regulatory approval. The US tech giant said in a Wednesday statement it would scrap its planned $5.4 billion purchase of Tower Semiconductor\n            \n                (TSEM), saying it had not received the necessary sign-off from regulators in time. The deal was first announced in February 2022. While Intel\n            \n                (INTC) did not specifically mention which jurisdiction it was waiting on, it had previously outlined efforts to clear the deal with authorities in China. In April, CEO Pat Gelsinger admitted that the process had been arduous, saying he had traveled to China to try to move things forward. \u201cAs part of my recent trip to China, we continue to work hard to complete the Tower acquisition,\u201d Gelsinger told analysts on an earnings call. The deal had been expected to close within 12 months.  Now, 18 months after it was first announced, the deal has yet to be signed off by China\u2019s competition regulator, the Financial Times reported Wednesday, citing two unidentified sources.  Neither Intel nor the Chinese regulator, the State Administration of Market Regulation, immediately responded to requests for comment from CNN. Companies that wish to merge must submit proposed transactions for approval from Chinese regulators if they make a certain amount of revenue from the country, according to law firms that advise global businesses. Tension between China and the United States, including some of its allies in Europe and Asia, has soared over semiconductors after US President Joe Biden introduced curbs to restrict Beijing\u2019s access to the critical technology last October. Both Intel and Tower said in their respective statements that the deal had been canceled based on mutual agreement.  To walk away, Intel will now pay Tower a termination fee of $353 million, the California-based company said in the statement.  Intel shares fell 3.6% in New York on Wednesday following the announcement, while Tower\u2019s Nasdaq-listed stock also plunged 10.7%. While the two firms won\u2019t be able to merge, they will continue to \u201clook for opportunities to work together in the future,\u201d according to Gelsinger. In the statement, he said Intel continued to see its investments in foundries, factories that make chips for other companies, as \u201ccritical\u201d to its overall manufacturing strategy. \u201cOur respect for Tower has only grown through this process,\u201d Gelsinger added. Tower Semiconductor CEO Russell Ellwanger said while his firm had been excited to join Intel, its decision to terminate the deal also came after \u201cthorough discussions and having received no indications regarding certain required regulatory approval.\u201d \u201cWe appreciate the efforts by all parties,\u201d he said.",

            "text": "India\u2019s largest airline has just revealed a whole new look. The colorful new livery design and logo are both part of a major Air India overhaul. The airline, which was purchased by Tata Group last year, aims to become an international aviation player on par with Etihad, Emirates, Singapore Airlines and other highly-rated carriers. \u201cColors, patterns, shapes and how they come together and what they represent matter, but our actions speak so much louder. We are in the midst of a total transformation to reimagine the role of\u00a0India\u2019s flagship\u00a0airline,\u201d Campbell Wilson, Air India\u2019s CEO, said in a statement. \u201cThe new\u00a0Air\u00a0India\u00a0is bold, confident and vibrant, but also warm and deeply rooted to its rich history and traditions that make\u00a0Indian hospitality a global benchmark for standards in service.\u201d The redesign includes a special custom font, Air India Sans, that will now be used across the brand. The tail fin design was inspired by chakras. And the redesign isn\u2019t just about shiny new paint. Air India is buying 470 new planes from Airbus and Boeing, plus the airline says it will begin updating and refurbishing existing planes by adding new seats, Wi-Fi capability and upgraded in-flight entertainment systems. Beyond the planes themselves, Air India has announced it will build new lounges for its hubs in Indira Gandhi International\u00a0Airport in Delhi (DEL) and John F Kennedy International Airport in New York City (JFK) and roll out a 24/7 customer support phone network in nine languages. The airline also says that it will \u201ccompletely redesign\u201d its loyalty program in 2024. Air India is a member of the Star Alliance, which also includes Air Canada, United Airlines and Lufthansa. Air India\u2019s makeover comes on the heels of a string of embarrassing headlines. Earlier this year, the airline was criticized by India\u2019s aviation regulator for its poor handling of on-board incidents, including one where a male passenger urinated on a female passenger while she was asleep.",

            "text": "Tesla is back to cutting prices in China, and investors don\u2019t seem happy about it. Shares of the electric vehicle maker slipped Monday after it cut prices for some of its cars in the country again, reigniting a price war in the world\u2019s biggest auto market. The manufacturer announced a significant discount for its Model Y in China on Monday, saying two models would be discounted by 14,000 yuan ($1,929) effective immediately.  The long-range model will now cost 299,900 yuan ($41,340), while the performance model will be priced at 349,900 yuan ($48,200), according to Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) posts on Chinese social media and its website. That would mean reductions of 4.5% and 3.8%, respectively. Additionally, buyers of Tesla\u2019s Model 3 will receive a subsidy of up to 8,000 yuan ($1,107) if they purchase the car through a preferred insurance provider through the end of September, the company said. The move failed to impress investors. Tesla\u2019s stock slid 1.2% in New York on Monday following the announcements. The price cuts, Tesla\u2019s first since January, reflect rising competition in China, particularly within its fast-moving electric vehicle sector. HSBC automotive analysts said Tuesday that they saw \u201crising pricing pressure driven by competition, higher inventories, and low-season promotions.\u201d \u201cSince the beginning of August, we have noticed that various [automakers] including Tesla, Zeekr, and Leapmotor have adopted more aggressive pricing tactics,\u201d they wrote in a report. The trend could continue throughout the third quarter, they predicted, with market leaders such as Tesla, BYD and other brands becoming \u201cincreasingly more aggressive.\u201d China is vital to Tesla, with deliveries from its Shanghai Gigafactory alone accounting for more than half of its global sales, according to a CNN calculation based on data from the China Passenger Car Association. The company has heavily experimented with pricing there after losing ground to competitors, such as Warren Buffett-backed BYD.  Tesla slashed prices several times in China between October and January after losing market share. In April, CEO Elon Musk hinted at more price cuts to help boost sales. The reductions kicked off a price war in the country, with dozens of car manufacturers following suit by offering steep discounts.  The cuts also pushed Tesla\u2019s profit margin to its lowest since 2020, though the company reported a larger-than-expected rise in profits for the last quarter.  The latest slash marks another U-turn for Tesla. In May, the company had reversed course, hiking prices globally, with the biggest increase made in China.  Analysts said at the time that Tesla may have been trying to send a nudge to customers who were hoping for even more reductions.",

Operating earnings totaled $10 billion in the second quarter, a 6.6% gain from the same period last year. Insurance underwriting and higher investment income helped boost Berkshire\u2019s operating profits.  The company posted net income of $35.9 billion after a loss of $43.6 billion in the second quarter of 2022. Berkshire posed $25.9 billion in investment gains last quarter, marking a significant turnaround from a year earlier, when its investments lost $53 billion in the second quarter alone. Berkshire\u2019s insurance underwriting business crossed the billion-dollar threshold, with earnings of $1.25 billion, up from $715 million in the second quarter of 2022.

            "text": "The Warner Bros. Film Group has apologized after the Twitter account for its \u201cBarbie\u201d film sparked backlash over its embrace of memes that appeared to depict the character immersed in atomic blast imagery from Universal\u2019s film \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d The posts sparked controversy in Japan and strong public criticism of Warner Bros. from the Japanese branch of the studio, which called the tweets from the official US account \u201cinconsiderate\u201d and demanded a response from its US headquarters. A subsidiary demanding an apology from a parent company is extraordinarily rare. Social media has been awash with unofficial fan-made \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d memes since the two blockbuster films \u2013 one about the iconic Mattel doll, the other about America\u2019s race to build the atomic bomb \u2013 were released on the same day in much of the world late last month. The tweets from the official \u201cBarbie\u201d account responding to the unofficial memes were later deleted. But screengrabs posted on Twitter, now officially known as X, showed the \u201cBarbie\u201d account responding positively to a meme of a mushroom cloud superimposed on the head of Margot Robbie, the film\u2019s star, and to another post depicting \u201cOppenheimer\u201d actor Cillian Murphy carrying a cheerful Barbie on his shoulder against a burning backdrop.  Critics said the posts trivialized the nuclear attacks on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the US Air Force in 1945, which killed at least 110,000 people instantly and tens of thousands more within the year. While the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d hashtag is not part of an official Warner Bros. marketing campaign, Warner Bros. Japan said it was \u201cextremely regrettable\u201d that the Barbie account had responded to the posts. \u201cWe take this situation very seriously and demand an appropriate response from the US headquarters,\u201d Warner Bros. Japan said in a tweet Monday. \u201cWe apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable by this inconsiderate response.\u201d Warner Bros. Film Group said in a statement to CNN Tuesday: \u201cWarner Brothers regrets its recent insensitive social media engagement. The studio offers a sincere apology.\u201d Warner Bros., like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.  Meanwhile, a rival hashtag \u2013 \u201cNoBarbenheimer\u201d \u2013 has garnered attention on social media in Japan, with people using it to criticize the \u201cBarbie\u201d account\u2019s conflation of the two films. \u201cWe never make official 9/11 or Nazi stories. But they can make a story about the atomic bomb,\u201d tweeted one user. \u201cI still think there is an underlying disregard for Asia. I am too sad for words. It\u2019s a shame.\u201d Another said they were \u201creally disappointed\u201d when they saw a post from the \u201cBarbie\u201d account, and would no longer buy a ticket. \u201cI won\u2019t watch it,\u201d they tweeted.  Jeffrey J. Hall, a US academic based in Tokyo, tweeted: \u201cThe #NoBarbenheimer controversy is a reminder of the perception gap between Japan and the US over the issue of nuclear weapons.  \u201cJapanese grow up learning about the horrors of the a-bombs and every year\u2019s memorial ceremonies are treated as national news \u2026  Although 78 years have passed, these events are far from forgotten in Japan,\u201d he added. Hall went on to explain that the #NoBarbenheimer posts were not intended to condemn the US for using nuclear weapons, or a call for the country to apologize. \u201cThey were negative reactions to how Barbie\u2019s US marketing team was making light of the atomic bombings with positive responses to a-bomb memes,\u201d he said. \u201cBarbie\u201d is set to hit theaters in Japan on August 11. \u201cOppenheimer\u2019s\u201d distributor in Japan, Toho-Towa, has yet to announce a release date for the movie, according to Reuters.",

Meanwhile, AirFrance-KLM Group reported revenue of over $8 billion for the second quarter, up almost a billion dollars from last year \u201cin spite of the inflationary context.\u201d \u201cI am very glad to see that the situation at airports is much better, including at KLM\u2019s hub at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,\u201d CEO Benjamin Smith said in a statement. \u201cThis season notably serves as a test run for 2024, when France will host the Olympic and Paralympic Games, of which Air France is an official partner.\u201d  If Qatar Airways\u2019 recent performance is any indication, the 2024 Games will benefit AirFrance-KLM. Qatar Airways reported a $1.2 billion profit for the past fiscal year, ascribing its strong performance to December\u2019s FIFA World Cup. Ahead of the controversial competition, questions also swirled around whether the tiny country with a population of just three million had the infrastructure to host an international tournament. But after winning its bid, Qatar invested some $220 billion into developing new transit systems and housing developments to accommodate an international audience. The venture was a success, with first-round tournament ticket sales surpassing 3 million, according to FIFA. In its report, Qatar Airways said that, throughout the 2022 World Cup, the company operated around 140,000 flights to bring more than 1.4 million people to Qatar. \u201cProfitability has been driven by a 100% increase in passenger revenues in the last year,\u201d the Group\u2019s chief executive Akbar Al Baker said in a statement. \u201cWe maintained our position as the airline of choice for millions of passengers worldwide and our team carried 31.7 million passengers, which is an increase of 71 percent over last year.\u201d But some travel industry leaders say this staggering growth may not last. Earlier this week Ryanair, Europe\u2019s largest airline by passenger numbers, warned that steep inflation and climbing interest rates could put a damper on air travel this fall and winter.  Even as Ryanair reported a profit of $735 million for the second quarter, CEO Michael O\u2019Leary said in a video posted on the company\u2019s website that the company is \u201cconcerned about the impact of these macroeconomic trends.\u201d  He added that the airline might need to reduce ticket prices to meet its ambitious passenger growth targets. But major airlines don\u2019t seem to have a problem filling seats at the moment, with  IAG reporting about 84% of its available seats were filled and AirFrance-KLM reporting 87%. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Mostafa Salem and Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.",

But that may be starting to change. Ryanair\n            \n                (RYAAY), Europe\u2019s largest airline by passenger numbers, warned Monday that high inflation and rising interest rates could dent appetite for air travel in the second half of the year.  \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the impact of these macroeconomic trends,\u201d CEO Michael O\u2019Leary said in a video posted on the company\u2019s website, adding that they \u201cmight affect consumer spending in the second half of the year.\u201d   Shares in the budget carrier, which is a bellwether for Europe\u2019s airline industry, fell as much as 5% Monday before paring losses. Its UK rivals EasyJet \n            \n                (ESYJY)and Jet2 fell as much as 4.6% and 4%, respectively, before making up some of the lost ground. Travel has roared back following the pandemic as people stuck at home for months on end relished the opportunity to see new places and reconnect with family and friends. That has enabled carriers such as Ryanair to charge higher fares, even as economic growth has stalled in many of its biggest markets. Late last year, O\u2019Leary shrugged off concerns about the impact of Europe\u2019s expected economic downturn on Ryanair\u2019s business, calling them \u201coverblown.\u201d  His comments Monday show that his outlook has turned more cautious, even though Ryanair reported profit of \u20ac663 million ($735 million) for the three months ending in June \u2014 nearly four times higher than in the same period last year, when bookings were badly affected by Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.  Average air fares at Ryanair jumped 42% in the latest quarter, following heavy discounting last year, but the company noted a \u201csoftening\u201d in fares for last-minute bookings in June and early July.  O\u2019Leary said the airline might need to reduce ticket prices to meet its ambitious passenger growth targets, particularly as inflation and rising mortgage rates weighed on consumer spending.  He retained a characteristic note of optimism, however, highlighting that Ryanair tended to grow in recessions as flyers hunted for cheaper tickets. The airline now expects to carry 183.5 million passengers in the 12 months ending in March 2024. That\u2019s slightly below the previous forecast for 185 million passengers, due to delays in the delivery of new Boeing 737 aircraft.  Ryanair agreed to buy up to 300 Boeing 737-10 planes earlier this year in a deal worth $40 billion.  The Dublin-based airline \u2014 which on Friday announced plans to return to Ukraine within weeks of the war ending \u2014 forecast \u201cmodest\u201d profit growth for the full year.  The International Air Transport Association said last month that it expected airlines globally to make $9.8 billion in net profit in 2023, more than doubling the forecast it made in December. The latest figure marks a significant turnaround for the aviation industry, which suffered net losses of $183 billion between 2020 and 2022 as pandemic lockdowns hit travel.",

            "text": "Traveling to Maldives \u2013 the 1,000-island archipelago off the western coast of India that\u2019s one of the world\u2019s most glamorous beach destinations \u2013 is always a special occasion. Now, a new airline aims to make it even more so. Beond \u2013 pronounced \u201cbeyond\u201d \u2013 aims to create a \u201cprivate jet\u201d experience by using narrow-body aircraft (rather than the wide-body often used on routes to the Maldives), and offering an all-premium cabin with lie-flat seats which share components with Ferrari cars. \u201cWe want to do something completely new,\u201d Beond\u2019s chief commercial officer Sascha Feuerherd tells CNN. \u201cWe deliberately chose to go for a luxury destination, which is a little paradise by itself, where people travel to relax and spend quality time. We want to ensure that they can travel there also in comfort, so that they are arriving fully relaxed.\u201d Based in Mal\u00e9 and set to start flying in fall 2023, Beond will initially operate a small fleet of Airbus A319 aircraft, before switching to the larger Airbus A321. Dubai and Delhi are the first two confirmed destinations.  Chasing the competition  About three dozen airlines currently offer service to Velana International Airport, Maldives\u2019 main airport near the capital island Mal\u00e9. To compete against them, Beond plans to choose its destinations carefully and fly customers directly to the island, rather than going through a connection in a hub, as the likes of Emirates, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines do. \u201cWe\u2019re going for the airports with big catchment areas, with a certain wealth behind it, and then fly people directly,\u201d says Feuerherd. So in Germany, for example, Beond wouldn\u2019t target Frankfurt \u2013 a business hub with plenty of competition. Instead, they\u2019d go for Munich, which has less competition and a higher incidence of leisure travelers.  In other markets, like Asia, Beond plans to enter into direct competition with other carriers and differentiate itself with a higher-quality service instead. \u201cThe Maldives is one of those markets that can fill an aircraft, even a mostly economy class cabin,\u201d says Feuerherd. \u201cBut that is making the Maldives lose some high-end passengers, because if they don\u2019t find adequate transportation, they\u2019d rather go somewhere else. That\u2019s where we really come into the game.\u201d   Beond will offer a total of just 44 seats on its Airbus A319s, even though the plane can carry up to 156 passengers in an all-economy layout. On the larger A321s, which will enter service in 2024, they plan to have 68 seats on a plane that normally has room for up to 220 economy passengers. This means there will be no dreaded middle seats \u2013 the two-abreast configuration aims to provide a sense of luxury and comfort. Designed by Italian manufacturer Optimares, which supplied similar interiors for a custom-designed Four Seasons A321 private jet, the seats share components with LaFerrari, a luxury sports car that was priced at about $1.5 million upon its release in 2013, and now sells for much more at auction. \u201cI\u2019m about six feet tall and so is our CEO, and that was pretty much the size reference we worked with, to avoid getting the feeling that we were slipping out of the bed,\u201d says Feuerherd. \u201cWe also very quickly decided that we wanted to have two abreast, because of the nature of our passengers, which is a lot of couples.\u201d   Competing on price  Jointly owned by UAE-based firm Arabesque and Maldivian hospitality company SIMDI, Beond\u2019s operating certificate is from Maldives as a designated carrier. It has a 50-year agreement with the Maldivian government.  Although it plans to start flying as early as September, the airline is still coy on its launch destinations beyond Delhi and Dubai, but Feuerherd says that, once at capacity (by the end of 2024), roughly 60% of the airline\u2019s traffic will come from Europe, with around 20 destinations.  Asian routes will include Japan, South Korea and China, and Beond will also offer direct connections to Australia, starting with Perth, and South Africa, initially to Cape Town.  By the end of 2024, the airline plans to operate about a dozen aircraft, all on lease, including some brand new A321LR airplanes \u2013 long-range versions of the popular A321.  Using narrowbody aircraft will be unusual on some of Beond\u2019s longer routes, which are normally served by larger, wide-body planes such as the Airbus A350 or the Boeing 787.  However all-business class airlines have used narrow-bodies before. La Compagnie, a French boutique airline connecting Paris to New York, has two A321LRs in its fleet of four (the others are A321neos). The Four Seasons private jet is also an A321LR. British Airways, meanwhile, used an A318 \u2013 the smallest aircraft in the Airbus A320 family \u2013 for its erstwhile all-business class flight from London to New York. And perhaps the small plane is the key. EOS, Maxjet and Silverjet, which all offered all-business class transatlantic flights before going bust in 2007 and 2008, all used wide-body aircraft. According to Feuerherd, the smaller plane won\u2019t be a problem for most passengers, because although the cabin will lack the \u201cairiness\u201d of larger aircraft, it\u2019ll increase the private jet feel. \u201cI do believe the advantages and disadvantages are really equalizing each other there,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to fill a wide-body with this concept \u2013 it would be slightly too big. But we have significant cost savings with a narrow-body, in terms of cost of ownership, fuel burn, staff involved, landing and handling charges, which is something that really gives us a competitive advantage over the big birds.\u201d As a result, Beond will be priced \u201cattractively,\u201d with fares from Europe starting at around $3,000 return, but increasing during peak season \u2013 which, for Maldives, is December to April. For comparison, the cheapest business class flight CNN could find from London to Mal\u00e9 in peak season was $3,133 with Etihad in January 2024. From Frankfurt, Oman Air has flights from $2,762 \u2013 a cheaper peak season fare than Beond is suggesting for its off season fares. However, neither flight is direct.  Meanwhile, Emirates is currently selling Dubai-Mal\u00e9 tickets from December to April next year from around $3100 in business class. There are no direct flights from Delhi, but carriers including Air India have business class seats from around $750 with a single connection.  \u201cMy personal target on the commercial side is that if we become too greedy, it\u2019s not going to be helpful,\u201d says Feuerherd. \u201cWe will not want to be the leader in terms of price.\u201d He adds that most bookings are projected to come from tour operators rather than directly from customers.   A niche market  According to Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at Cirium, an aviation consultancy, the initial routes that Beond is targeting \u2013 Dubai and Delhi \u2013 have differing potential. \u201cDubai is presently well served from Mal\u00e9, with an average of seven daily rotations in August 2023 and more than 60,000 seats each way in the month,\u201d he says, citing schedule data that Cirium has pulled.    \u201cThis includes around 12% of those seats in premium class. Competition on that route will be challenging.  \u201cIn contrast, Delhi-Mal\u00e9 is presently unserved, at least directly, hence there may be more opportunity.\u201d Mike Stengel, a principal at Aerodynamic Advisory, another aviation consultancy, says that in the history of aviation, the fortunes of all-business class airlines have not been great: \u201cOne reason is that their destiny is tied to these concentrated niche markets; they simply don\u2019t offer the same type of connectivity options that network airlines do.\u201d By being tied to only premium class travelers, he adds, they\u2019re susceptible to downturns or softening in business travel demand: \u201cIn the long term, I think they\u2019re going to face some pretty stiff competition, especially from the large Middle East airlines. It\u2019s hard for anyone to beat out first or business class from Emirates or Qatar or Etihad.\u201d However, he believes that Maldives is certainly the right market for a new luxury option. \u201cI think there are some legs to this, especially if they can channel demand from luxury travel agencies that are selling it as part of a package,\u201d he says. \u201cThere probably is a niche to carve out of premium travelers who want more of a private jet experience, but maybe don\u2019t have the private jet budget.\u201d",

Last week, United Airlines pilots, represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, reached a deal in principle with the airline, giving the pilots up to a 40% raise. The deal has about $10 billion in value over the life of the contract, the union said, with improvements to \u201cquality of work-life, compensation, job security, work rules, retirement, benefits.\u201d American Airlines pilots pushed back after the announcement.  Last week, APA President Ed Sicher said in a statement it is \u201cdead obvious\u201d their union\u2019s existing tentative agreement is \u201cwoefully deficient by comparison\u201d to the tentative agreement reached by its competitor airline\u2019s pilots.

Europe\u2019s biggest budget carrier announced plans to base up to 30 new Boeing\n            \n                (BA) 737 MAX aircraft \u2014 worth over $3 billion \u2014 at Ukraine\u2019s three main airports once the European Union Aviation Safety Agency declares it safe to fly to the country. Ryanair\n            \n                (RYAAY) said in a statement Thursday it would offer flights to and from Ukraine within eight weeks of that happening. The airline would operate 600 flights per week between Kyiv, Lviv and Odesa and more than 20 capitals in the European Union. The resumption of flights from Kharkiv and Kherson \u2014 both served by Ryanair until Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022 forced the closure of Ukrainian airspace to commercial flights \u2014 would have to wait until infrastructure at both airports had been rebuilt.  Speaking from Kyiv, Ryanair CEO Michael O\u2019Leary said the carrier would \u201ccharge back\u201d into Ukraine after the war. \u201cThe fastest way to rebuild and restore the Ukrainian economy will be with low-fare air travel,\u201d he added. O\u2019Leary said Kyiv\u2019s main airport, Boryspil International Airport, which he visited Thursday, was \u201cfully ready for the resumption of flights as soon as possible.\u201d Ryanair said it planned to offer more than 5 million seats to, from and within Ukraine in the first 12 months after the end of the war. It would increase that to more than 10 million seats over a five-year period. \u201cThe visit of Ryanair senior management to Boryspil Airport is a powerful signal that the largest airline in Europe sees huge potential in the Ukrainian air transport market,\u201d said Boryspil International Airport CEO Oleksiy Dubrevskyy. The move highlights Ukraine\u2019s sustained efforts to court international investors, as it plans for its future after the war.  At the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London last month, more than 400 global companies \u2014 including Citi, Sanofi\n            \n                (SNY) and Philips \u2014 pledged to boost investment in the war-torn economy.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has also enlisted BlackRock\n            \n                (BLK) and JPMorgan to advise on the Ukraine Development Fund, a vehicle that seeks to mobilize capital from private and public sector investors toward rebuilding the Ukrainian economy.",

            "text": "Goldman Sachs reported a sharp drop in profit on Wednesday as dealmaking and trading, a core part of the mega bank\u2019s business, dry up. The Wall Street titan also felt the pain of a nearly $1 billion reduction in the value of its consumer and real estate businesses. Goldman saw its investment banking revenue decline by about 20% in the second quarter of 2023, according to its latest earnings report, released Wednesday. Trading revenue also fell by 14%. Overall, profit fell by 58% from a year ago, to $1.2 billion.  While Citigroup and Morgan Stanley also saw their profit decline, Goldman reported the largest drop of its peers.  The company brought in $3.08 per share in the second quarter, falling short of the $3.16 per share analysts had expected, according to FactSet. Goldman is the only large bank so far to miss on earnings per share estimates.  This marks the worst quarterly profits since early 2020, during the pandemic-induced recession. The poor report will likely increase scrutiny of CEO David Solomon who has been under pressure for overseeing the bank\u2019s shrinking consumer business.  \u201cOur results were impacted by the challenging macro environment and in particular headwinds facing our specific mix of businesses,\u201d said Solomon on Goldman\u2019s earnings call Wednesday morning. \u201cActivity levels in many areas of investment banking hover near decade-long lows and clients largely maintained a risk off posture over the course of the quarter.\u201d There are green shoots emerging in M&A, said Solomon. \u201cIt definitely feels better over the course of the last six to eight weeks than it felt earlier in the year,\u201d he said. \u201cI know this level of 10-year lows in investment banking activity is not going to be the normal on a forward basis.\u201d Solomon said that winding down the bank\u2019s consumer lending business will free up capital and time to refocus on efforts that are core to the bank\u2019s strategy.  Still, not all analysts agree with that assessment.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been very underimpressed by management\u2019s execution and vision in regard to the consumer side of [Goldman Sachs],\u201d said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, on Wednesday. \u201cThe inability to execute on this front has led us to believe that there is a lot of internal strife at the company, which could create employee retention problems in the future as faith in David Solomon could be lost.\u201d Solomon, 61, did not speak to a potential succession plan during the earnings call.  Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) stock was down in early trading but erased earlier losses and was trading nearly 0.9% higher following the call.",

The deployments come after two incidents earlier this month in which Iranian Navy ships attempted to seize merchant vessels in the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman.  The US Navy intervened in both incidents on July 5.

            "text": "The global private jet fleet has more than doubled in the last two decades and the market is on fire, with new industry records set for transaction and dollar volume in 2021 and 2022, according to a new report by the US Institute for Policy Studies.  Private jets emit at least 10 times more pollutants than commercial planes per passenger, disproportionately contributing to the aviation sector\u2019s climate impact, according to the report, which was published in May 2023.  What\u2019s more, while approximately one out of every six flights handled by the Federal Aviation Administration is private, the sector only contributes 2% of the taxes that primarily fund the agency. Amid these concerns, one private jet owner has decided to scale back. Stephen Prince, vice-chair of the Patriotic Millionaires \u2013 a group of wealthy Americans pushing for higher taxes which also contributed to the report \u2013 is giving up his Cessna 650 Citation III.  He decided to ditch the plane \u2013 a mid-size, long range corporate jet with room for up to nine passengers \u2013 after he learned how much more carbon-intensive flying private is compared to commercial. \u201cI was gobsmacked by the fact that by being so in love with private air travel, I was willing to ignore what a horrible travesty I was perpetrating on the environment and on future generations,\u201d he tells CNN. \u201cI\u2019ve got to change. I just can\u2019t continue to do this.\u201d   The long road back to commercial  Prince has owned half a dozen private jets before the Citation III, which is the largest and most expensive to operate he\u2019s ever had \u2013 the running costs alone work out at about $275,000 to $300,000 per year. He says flying private is so good, it becomes addictive. \u201cIt\u2019s just absolutely the best way to travel. But I\u2019m going to give it up. I\u2019m just going back to flying commercially, as much as I despise the process after having flown privately for the last six or seven years,\u201d he says. \u201cTSA, long lines, canceled flights, lost luggage \u2013 I despise all the things that go along with it. And when you fly first class, it\u2019s not cheap, either. But I made my decision back in March this year. And I\u2019m sticking with it, I\u2019m selling it, I\u2019m going to aggressively get rid of it.\u201d The Cessna is currently worth about $1 million and in the current market it should find a buyer pretty quickly.    There\u2019s just one catch. Prince, an entrepreneur in the gift card and payments industry, may be ditching his jet \u2013 but he\u2019s not going to give up private air travel entirely.  \u201cI have a friend who\u2019s going to let me lease his smaller aircraft,\u201d he says, \u201cIt\u2019s a twin turbo, which burns about a fourth of the amount of fuel of the Cessna \u2013 and I\u2019m only going to use it two or three times a year to go out to a pheasant hunting preserve in the northwest corner of Nebraska.\u201d He adds that he has no intention of going out of his way to persuade other millionaires to give up their jets. \u201cI\u2019m not going out trying to sell this as a broadcast message by any means,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen talking with my conservative, wealthy friends, I certainly don\u2019t hesitate to say that they need to do the same thing, but it\u2019s not a big mission of mine.\u201d Prince does believe, however, that wealthy people in the US should pay more taxes. \u201cI think that all of us in American society are not paying as much as we need to,\u201d he says.  \u201cNobody wants to pay taxes and they come up with all these explanations and reasons why, but the real reason is that they\u2019re greedy. And I am too! We all are. But we all need to become a member of the \u2018we\u2019 society, not the \u2018me\u2019 society. If we\u2019re not concerned about the greater good of all mankind, then we\u2019re living with a bad set of principles.\u201d  Paying the real cost  He\u2019s not the only one who thinks so. In line with Prince\u2019s thoughts, the Institute for Policy Studies report advocates for higher taxes on both private jet sales and fuel.  The authors recommend a 10% sales tax on used aircraft and 5% on new. They also call for the federal jet fuel tax to be doubled from $0.219 per gallon to $0.438 per gallon for the most frequent private jet users. As an example, the report notes that Elon Musk \u2013 one of the most active private jet users in the US \u2013 would pay an additional $3.94 million in taxes under these proposed conditions.  The authors of the report calculate that he purchased a new jet, took 171 flights (roughly one every other day), consumed over 220,000 gallons of jet fuel and created 2,100 tons of carbon emissions in 2022 \u2013 132 times the emissions of the average American. \u201cPrivate jets are a reflection of the growing inequality and concentration of wealth and power in very few hands,\u201d Chuck Collins, one of the authors of the report, tells CNN.  \u201cFrom an ecological perspective, we need to decarbonize the aviation sector. And this seems like an awfully good starting point. It\u2019s one of the greatest carbon emitters, but it\u2019s really a very small number of people. We should have very high taxes, [usage] taxes and fuel taxes that discourage private jet owners.\u201d   Collins adds that the construction of private aviation infrastructure should stop altogether, as this form of transportation should be phased out. \u201cIn my community outside Boston, there\u2019s a private airport, Hanscom Field, and there\u2019s a whole push to expand it because that is the suburban private jetport,\u201d he says. \u201cBut people are saying that in the same way we probably shouldn\u2019t be building new fossil fuel infrastructure that will push us over the danger line in terms of emissions, we shouldn\u2019t be building new infrastructure to serve the private jet class. That\u2019s not really the kind of direction we should go in.\u201d The size of the global private jet fleet has increased 133% in the last two decades, from 9,895 aircraft in 2000 to 23,133 in mid-2022, according to the report. Meanwhile, in Europe, a group of countries including France and Ireland has called on European policymakers to toughen regulations around private jets in order to curb their use. In April, Schiphol airport in Amsterdam announced it is considering banning private jets from its grounds altogether.  \u201cI think that\u2019s the right way to go,\u201d says Collins. \u201cIt may be difficult to outright ban private air travel, but we should certainly make it pay its real ecological and social costs.\u201d",

In a followup statement Tuesday, Foxconn reaffirmed its commitment to invest in Indian chipmaking, saying it will apply for a government program that subsidizes the cost of setting up semiconductor or electronic display production facilities in the country. \u201cBuilding fabs from scratch in a new geography is a challenge, but Foxconn is committed to invest in India,\u201d the company said, referring to fabrication plants, the technical term for semiconductor factories. \u201cThere was recognition from both sides that the project was not moving fast enough, there were challenging gaps we were not able to smoothly overcome, as well as external issues unrelated to the project,\u201d it said. In a statement, Vedanta said it had already lined up other partners to set up India\u2019s first semiconductor production plant.  The conglomerate has obtained a license from a chipmaker to produce 40-nanometer chips, and will soon obtain another license for 28-nanometer chips, it added.  \u201cIndia remains pivotal in repositioning global semiconductor supply chains,\u201d a company spokesperson said.  The semiconductor industry is constantly trying to make microchips smaller and faster. For comparison, IBM announced in 2021 it had created a 2-nanometer chip: the smallest, most powerful microchip yet developed. Endorsed by Modi The deal was announced in February 2022 to much fanfare.  An investment figure for the facility was not provided, but Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted in September that the total investment would amount to 1.54 trillion rupees, which was then equivalent to $19.4 billion. Since announcing the joint venture, Foxconn CEO Young Liu has been looking for other opportunities in India, having traveled there in February to seek new collaborators. The company, which already has factories in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, is one of many global tech firms looking for opportunities in the country, particularly as multinationals seek to diversify their supply chains beyond China.  On Monday, India\u2019s electronics and information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told Indian news outlet and CNN affiliate News18 that both Vedanta and Foxconn are \u201ccompletely committed to India\u2019s semiconductor mission.\u201d Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the country\u2019s minister of state for electronics and IT, also tweeted that the news \u201cchanges nothing about\u201d India\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing goals, adding that the decision would still allow \u201cboth companies to independently pursue their strategies\u201d in India. The project had been hailed as a milestone in India\u2019s campaign to attract more investment in manufacturing, a sector sorely needed to help ease unemployment. Prime Minister Modi had framed the project as a significant boost for the economy and jobs. Foxconn shares rose 1.3% in Taipei on Tuesday following its announcement, while Vedanta\u2019s shares fell 1.4% in Mumbai. Other prominent tech companies have moved to expand production in India recently.  Last month, US chipmaker Micron\n            \n                (MICR) announced a new factory in the western state of Gujarat, calling it the country\u2019s first semiconductor assembly and test manufacturing facility.  The venture will see Micron invest up to $825 million, and create \u201cup to 5,000 new direct Micron jobs and 15,000 community jobs over the next several years,\u201d according to the company.",

            "text": "Elon Musk on Wednesday announced the formation of a new company focused on artificial intelligence, after months of teasing plans to build a rival to ChatGPT.  The company, called xAI, unveiled a website and a team of a dozen staffers. The new company will be led by Musk, according to the website, and \u201cwill work closely with X (Twitter), Tesla, and other companies to make progress towards our mission.\u201d \u201cThe goal of xAI is to understand the true nature of the universe,\u201d the website states, echoing language Musk has used before to describe his AI ambitions.  Musk was an early backer of ChatGPT-creator OpenAI, but later criticized the company for inputting safeguards that aim to prevent the viral chatbot from spewing biased or sexist responses.  \u201cThe danger of training AI to be woke \u2013 in other words, lie \u2013 is deadly,\u201d Musk tweeted in December, responding to a Twitter user who asked OpenAI\u2019s CEO if it was possible to \u201cturn off the woke settings\u201d on ChatGPT. In an interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson in April, Musk said teased plans for his new AI venture. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start something which I call TruthGPT,\u201d he said, describing it as a \u201cmaximum truth-seeking AI\u201d that \u201ccares about understanding the universe.\u201d Musk\u2019s announcement of the new company comes months after he warned in an interview that he thinks AI could cause \u201ccivilization destruction\u201d and joined other tech leaders in \n            \n                calling for a pause in an \u201cout of control\u201d AI race.  Few other details on the company\u2019s mission were immediately available, but the website indicates it is actively recruiting staff. At the moment, all of the dozen staffers on the website appear to be men.  The announcement of Musk\u2019s latest venture comes at a precarious moment for Musk.   Twitter, the company he acquired for $44 billion in October, now faces an uncertain future after Meta launched a rival app called Threads. Meta\u2019s app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week. Meanwhile, there were multiple reports of Twitter\u2019s usage declining.  The turbulence at Twitter comes after months of Musk alienating some users and advertisers by slashing staff, pushing through controversial policy changes and making a number of incendiary remarks.  In addition to Twitter, Musk runs several other companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and The Boring Company. ",

            "text": "The Federal Aviation Administration has certified for testing a vehicle that a California startup describes as a flying car \u2014 the first fully electric vehicle that can both fly and travel on roads to receive US government approval.  Alef Automotive said that its vehicle/aircraft, dubbed the \u201cModel A,\u201d is the first flying vehicle that is drivable on public roads and able to park like a normal car. It also has vertical takeoff and landing capabilities. It apparently will be able to carry one or two occupants and will have a road-range of 200 miles and a flying range of 110 miles. The company expects to sell the vehicle for $300,000 each with the first delivery by projected for the end of 2025.  The FAA confirmed that it has issued the company a special airworthiness certificate, allowing for limited purposes that include exhibition, research and development. Numerous companies are working on all-electric VTOLs, which stands for vehicle takeoff and landing aircraft. The FAA said that Alef is \u201cnot the first aircraft of its kind\u201d to get a special airworthiness certificate. However,  Alef noted that its vehicle is different because of its ability to function both on roads and in the air, to appear like a normal car and to park in a normal parking space.  \u201cWe\u2019re excited to receive this certification from the FAA. It allows us to move closer to bringing people an environmentally friendly and faster commute, saving individuals and companies hours each week. This is a one small step for planes, one giant step for cars,\u201d said Jim Dukhovny, the CEO of Alef. The company\u2019s website said the flying car will be a certified as a \u201clow speed vehicle,\u201d which means it won\u2019t be able to go faster than about 25 miles per hour on a paved road. \u201cThe assumption is that, if a driver needs a faster route, a driver will use Alef\u2019s flight capabilities,\u201d the company posted on the site.  Regardless, It also still needs approval from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to go on roads. Development has been underway on the vehicle since 2015. Four friends, Constantine Kisly, Pavel Markin, Oleg Petrov and Dukhovny, inspired by the \u201cBack to the Future\u201d movies (which foresaw flying cars being available in that year), decided to form a company to try to develop them.  According to the company, an initial automated test flight of a skeleton version of the car was successfully conducted in 2018, and a full-size prototype was flown the following year. But Alef said that it needed the FAA\u2019s special airworthiness certificate to continue conducting the necessary research and development. The company also said that earlier this year that it had taken refundable pre-orders for more than 400 of the vehicles, with the cost of $150 for to be in the general queue or $1,500 for the priority queue.

            "text": "JetBlue Airways, seeking to protect a planned $3.8 billion purchase of Spirit Airlines, said on Wednesday it would follow a US judge\u2019s May order that it end an alliance with American Airlines. The New York-based carrier said while it \u201cstrongly\u201d disagrees, it would not appeal the court\u2019s ruling. JetBlue said it had informed American last week of its decision to terminate the three-year-old alliance, which allowed the two carriers to coordinate flights and pool revenue. American said on Wednesday it still planned to appeal the ruling. American is the largest US airline by fleet size and JetBlue is the sixth largest. JetBlue said terminating its alliance with American renders \u201centirely moot\u201d the US Justice Department\u2019s (DOJ) objections that led it to file suit to block its merger deal with Spirit, which would be the biggest in the US airline industry since American and US Airways merged in 2013. \u201cThis decision will enable us to focus even more on our combination with Spirit,\u201d CEO Robin Hayes said in a staff memo. The DOJ declined to comment. Andre Barlow, an antitrust attorney at Doyle, Barlow & Mazard PLLC, said he did not think that terminating the alliance would change JetBlue\u2019s odds in its legal battle over the Spirit deal. \u201cI don\u2019t think it helps,\u201d Barlow said. \u201cIt\u2019s even better for the DOJ.\u201d Alliance strategy setback The alliance\u2019s dissolution is a setback to American\u2019s strategy to grow revenue by relying more heavily on alliance partners to ferry passengers in uncompetitive markets. The \u201cNortheast Alliance\u201d with JetBlue helped American compete in the New York market, where it had been losing money. It allowed American to move away from unprofitable routes while maintaining a presence in New York and letting it feed traffic to its global partners who fly into the region. American has yet to spell out plans for the capacity it gave to JetBlue. The carrier could now be forced to rebuild its capacity or cut international flights out of the region. On May 19, US District Judge Leo Sorokin in Boston ordered JetBlue and American to end the partnership, saying it \u201csubstantially\u201d diminished competition in the domestic market. The DOJ sued in 2021 to undo the Northeast Alliance, which was announced the previous year. It called it a \u201cde facto merger\u201d of American and JetBlue operations in Boston and New York that removed incentives to compete and would end up costing consumers an additional $700 million a year to fly out of the region\u2019s busy airports. JetBlue said its decision to unwind the alliance would not result in any immediate changes for customers. The company said it expects to work out a wind down plan that protects consumers. But without the alliance, Hayes said JetBlue would likely need fewer employees in New York and Boston. He promised the company would manage staffing levels through natural attrition, options to transfer to other cities and a reduction in new hiring rather than through furloughs.",

Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) China\u2019s wholesale deliveries reached 247,217 vehicles in the April to June months, up 120% from a year ago, according to a CNN calculation based on data released Tuesday by the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). In June, Tesla China reported wholesale deliveries of 93,680 vehicles, up 19% from the same period a year ago, preliminary data from the CPCA showed. The wholesale figures include both domestic sales and exports from the Shanghai Gigafactory. Overall, China\u2019s electric vehicle (EV) market powered ahead in the second quarter, thanks to massive price cuts by car suppliers and local government subsidies, the CPCA said.  Sales of new energy vehicles \u2014 which include battery powered EVs, plug-in hybrids and fuel cell vehicles \u2014 hit a record high in June, it added. The robust shipments from the Shanghai factory boosted Tesla\u2019s global sales, sending its shares soaring. On Sunday, the company announced it delivered over 466,000 vehicles worldwide in the second quarter, the highest quarterly number on record. The electric carmaker led by Elon Musk doesn\u2019t break down its sales by region. The CPCA data suggests Tesla\u2019s shipments from Shanghai accounted for 53% of its total sales.

BYD is currently the best-selling EV brand in China, followed by Tesla, according to the CPCA.

Captains Barry Behnfeldt and Aaron Wilson completed their goal of stopping in all 48 contiguous states in less time than they expected \u2013 accomplishing it in 44 hours and seven minutes, according to a news release. Aside from the world-record attempt by the pair of US military veterans, which has not yet been confirmed by Guinness World Records, the men sought to inspire future pilots and raise funds for the Veteran\u2019s Airlift Command. The organization provides free, private air travel for combat-injured veterans. Behnfeldt and Wilson have raised over $30,000 for the VAC. They also wanted to acknowledge this year as the 120th anniversary of powered flight. The pilots initially planned for a trip of 43 hours and 31 minutes while leaving room for setbacks, according to their website.  The mission began with a conversation between Behnfeldt, who\u2019s worked at Delta for 24 years, and a fellow airline pilot. \u201cWe were talking one day on one of our legs, and he talked about this pilot that he had flown with that attempted to set this Guinness World Record in landing in 48 states,\u201d Behnfeldt told CNN. \u201cIt sparked an interest.\u201d  From there, Behnfeldt said he reached out to Wilson, who, like Behnfeldt, also pilots Delta planes and also attended the Bowling Green State University School of Aviation.  \u201cHe had all the logistics and everything figured out,\u201d Wilson said in a news release from their alma mater.  \u201cFlying across the country in a small airplane is something I\u2019ve always wanted to do, so I was immediately sold on the idea,\u201d Wilson said in the release. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any hesitation about saying yes.\u201d  Behnfeldt, who served in the US Navy for 30 years, said his Navy pal and fellow pilot Thomas Twiddy also joined the pair on the trip as an in-flight technician.  The trio set off at night on June 4 from Berrien Springs, Michigan, for a journey of 5,008 miles that included no hotel stays \u2013 only periods of rest aboard the small plane as each pilot took turns flying to each state. Their journey wrapped up on June 6 when they landed in the afternoon in Portland, Maine.  Flying in Behnfeldt\u2019s single-engine Piper Saratoga plane, they flew across the US intending to spend between 10 minutes and just under a half an hour at each airport, Behnfeldt told CNN. The only time the plane was shut off during their brief stops was during the refueling process, Behnfeldt said. \u201cAnd as it turned out, for the 41 stops that we did where we did not take fuel and we didn\u2019t shut down, the average time on the ground was 8 minutes,\u201d said Behnfeldt, who accommodated for about 18 minutes on the ground for fuel stops in his initial planning. One of their stops was in Coffeyville, Kansas, around 11:30 p.m., Behnfeldt recalled.  \u201cThere were close to 50 people (of all ages) out on the ramp greeting us, and we weren\u2019t supposed to take fuel there,\u201d he said.  The pilots decided to shut down briefly and refuel and hand out t-shirts at the stop where so many had come out to support them. \u201cA 6-year-old girl came up me and asked, \u2018Would you sign my T-shirt?\u2019\u201d Behnfeldt said. \u201cIt took us a little longer to get through that stop, but it was 100% worth it.\u201d  Behnfeldt and Wilson will have to wait several weeks before receiving confirmation of whether their impressive flight path qualified as a world record, a Guinness World Record spokesperson told CNN in an email.

            "text": "United CEO Scott Kirby is apologizing to customers and his own employees after taking a private jet during a week when his airline was canceling thousands of flights.  The airline confirmed Kirby flew from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey to Denver, Colorado, on Wednesday, and that the company did not pay for his flight. Teterboro is about 17 miles from Newark, New Jersey, where one of United\u2019s largest hubs is located and which was the center of the airline\u2019s meltdown this week. In a statement, Kirby said he regrets that his actions distracted from the professionalism of United employees. \u201cTaking a private jet was the wrong decision because it was insensitive to our customers who were waiting to get home,\u201d Kirby said in a statement. \u201cI sincerely apologize to our customers and our team members who have been working around-the-clock for several days \u2013 often through severe weather \u2013 to take care of our customers.\u201d  On Wednesday, many customers at Newark Liberty International Airport couldn\u2019t get to their destinations because there were no flights available. United customers have been plagued by flight delays, cancellations and lost luggage this week. Going forward, Kirby promised \u201cto better demonstrate my respect for the dedication of our team members and the loyalty of our customers.\u201d Center of troubles The airline has canceled more than 3,000 flights since Saturday, stranding thousands of customers. On Friday as of the evening, United had 979 flight delays, or 34% of its operations, and 234 canceled flights, according to FlightAware. Kirby blamed much of the problems with the airline\u2019s service meltdown on the Federal Aviation Administration and a lack of adequate staffing at air traffic control centers, particularly in the New York area.  \u201cThe FAA frankly failed us this weekend,\u201d said Kirby in an internal company memo to United staff shared with CNN on Wednesday.  He said the FAA reduced arrival rates at Newark by 40% and departure rates by 75% was \u201calmost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA.\u201d  But Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who oversees the FAA, pushed back on that criticism of his agency Wednesday evening on CNN Primetime. \u201cLook, United Airlines has some internal issues they need to work through. They\u2019ve really been struggling this week, even relative to other US airlines,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. While he agreed there needs to be more air traffic controllers, Buttigieg said \u201cI want to be very clear, air traffic control issues are not the number one issue causing cancellations and delays. They\u2019re not even the number two issue. All the data, including industry\u2019s own data is very clear on that.\u201d",

            "text": "Spirit AeroSystems, a key supplier to Boeing, is set to reopen next week after members of the International Association of Machinists voted Thursday to ratify a tentative labor agreement and end a week-long strike. Members voted 63% in favor of the four-year agreement, according to vote results announced Thursday. It\u2019s the first new contract that the union members at Spirit have had in 13 years. A previous 10-year deal was extended during the pandemic. The union had put the company\u2019s previous offer up to a vote earlier this month. The prior offer from the company included a 34% pay increase, a 14.7% increase in retirement benefits with a new 401k match, voluntary Sunday overtime, and increased time off, according to the union. But rank and file members rejected that offer with 79% of members voting no, and 85% voted to strike, the union said. A new tentative deal was reached earlier this week, which the union said was a significant improvement over the rejected deal in wages, prescription drug coverage and overtime rules. \u201cOur membership clearly said the original offer was unacceptable by rejecting it soundly. The committee returned to the table to address their concerns,\u201d said Jason Baze, the union\u2019s lead negotiator in the talks. The company said it welcomed the vote and would begin ramping up operations in preparation for the resumption of work next week. \u201cWe listened closely to our employees and brought forward a fair-and-competitive offer,\u201d said Spirit CEO Tom Gentile. \u201cWith its approval by our IAM-represented employees, we look forward to getting back to the important work of delivering quality products to our customers.\u201d Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the vote. The 6,000-worker strike was the latest problem for Boeing. It has halted deliveries of numerous plane models in recent years, including the 737 Max, which had problems with the fuselage that Spirit assembled. The fuselage problem, discovered in April, was not serious enough to force in-service planes to be grounded. But it stopped deliveries of Boeing\u2019s bestselling jet while the company addressed the problem. Spirit had been struggling in the wake of Boeing\u2019s various woes in recent years. Its last profitable year was in 2019. It has lost nearly $2 billion since then. Boeing continued to build the 737 Max even during its 20-month grounding following two fatal crashes. That helped keep Spirit and other major suppliers alive. - CNN\u2019s Vanessa Yurkevich contributed to this report",

            "title": "Virgin Galactic has sold 800 tickets to the edge of space. The first customers just took flight",
            "text": "Virgin Galactic, the venture founded by British billionaire Richard Branson, successfully launched its first paying customers to the edge of space \u2014 a milestone two decades in the making. The company\u2019s inaugural commercial flight Thursday was a research-focused mission with Italian Air Force-funded passengers \u2014 rather than a group of celebrities and wealthy thrill seekers similar to those flown by Virgin Galactic\u2019s chief competitor, Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin. (Future Virgin Galactic flights, however, are expected to include a range of high-profile customers.) The mission carried two Italian Air Force personnel \u2014 Col. Walter Villadei, who is also slated to travel to orbit on a future paid SpaceX mission; and Lt. Col. Angelo Landolfi, a physician who has trained as a crew surgeon for Russian cosmonauts. Also on board were Pantaleone Carlucci, an engineer with Italy\u2019s National Research Council, and Colin Bennett, a Virgin Galactic astronaut instructor who flew alongside Branson on the company\u2019s highly publicized 2021 mission. Bennett\u2019s role was to assess the comfort and function of the flight, using that information to inform future changes Virgin Galactic might make to its rocket-powered space plane, VSS Unity. The group\u2019s journey played out in several stages. It began at Virgin Galactic\u2019s spaceport in New Mexico, where the passengers boarded VSS Unity as it sat attached beneath the wing of a massive twin-fuselage mothership, an aircraft called VMS Eve. VMS Eve took off much like an airplane, barreling down a runway before it ascended to more than 40,000 feet (12,192 meters). After reaching its designated altitude, VMS Eve released the VSS Unity, which then fired its rocket engine for about one minute as it swooped directly upward, sending it vaulting toward the stars. The vehicle ventured more than 50 miles (80 kilometers) above Earth\u2019s surface, the altitude that the United States government considers the edge of outer space. (Internationally, the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, located 62 miles (100 kilometers) above sea level, is often used to mark the boundary between our planet and space \u2014 but there\u2019s a lot of gray area.) The space plane reached supersonic speeds as it hurled upward. And at the peak of its flight, the vehicle spent a few minutes in weightlessness as it entered freefall and glided back to the spaceport for a runway landing. The entire journey lasted about an hour and a half. Zero-gravity research goals Those brief moments that VSS Unity spent in zero gravity are precisely what researchers are interested in. Organizations such as NASA have routinely flown experiments on suborbital rockets, including Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin missions. The weightless environment can offer scientists a better fundamental understanding of how something works \u2014\u00a0and reveal interesting information about a material\u2019s behavior in space. Sending research on suborbital missions can also be far cheaper than launching an experiment to the International Space Station, which requires much larger rockets and faster speeds. On this suborbital trek, the Italian Air Force and National Research Council selected a suite of 13 experiments. It included research into how the passengers\u2019 heart rates behave during acceleration, an attempt to measure cosmic radiation in the upper atmosphere, and an examination of how various biofuels behave under different pressures in microgravity. Virgin Galactic\u2019s journey This mission marked one of the most significant steps forward for Virgin Galactic since the company was founded in the early 2000s, after Branson became enamored with a space plane developed by aircraft designer Burt Rutan and Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen. Branson initially thought he could begin flying wealthy customers as early as 2008. But it wasn\u2019t that simple. Virgin Galactic has spent the past two decades working to ready an upgraded version of Rutan\u2019s space plane \u2014 designed to be large enough to carry passengers in the cabin \u2014 for commercial service. The company has also been losing money for years, burning through funds as it has attempted to finish its test flights and begin welcoming customers \u2014 some of whom paid for their tickets more than a decade ago. The company has sold about 800 tickets, including 600 at prices up to $250,000 and another couple hundred at $450,000 per ticket. The Italian Air Force first made its deal for a Virgin Galactic flight in 2019, and the company has long been planning to get it off the ground before more tourism-oriented missions. Space tourism risks Virgin Galactic\u2019s launch comes amid heightened awareness of high-stakes tours undertaken by wealthy adventurers after the loss on June 18 of an OceanGate Expeditions submersible bound for the Titanic wreckage in the Atlantic Ocean. Five people died, including three who had purchased tickets that cost about $250,000 each, according to the company\u2019s website. The parallels between deep-sea exploration and space tourism are striking: Many of the same people who have ventured to the ocean\u2019s depths have also purchased tickets to space. That includes the late Hamish Harding, a Blue Origin passenger in 2022 who died in the OceanGate submersible. Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin have routinely emphasized the importance of safety, saying it is paramount to their individual success as well as the overall industry. Much like deep-sea exploration, however, traveling to space comes with inherent risks. In a tragic 2014 accident, Virgin Galactic\u2019s space plane broke apart during flight, killing the mission\u2019s copilot, Michael Alsbury. (That test flight was overseen by a third-party company, Scaled Composites, and was operated under an experimental license.) And a Blue Origin rocket exploded on ascent in 2022, though it was not carrying human passengers and the vehicle\u2019s safety abort functioned as intended, suggesting a crew would have survived. Much like deep-sea diving, the commercial space industry is largely self-regulated in the United States. Congress has placed a moratorium on new regulations for private human spaceflight,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Federal Aviation Administration. The moratorium \u2014 which has been extended several times since it was implemented in 2004 and is set to expire again in October \u2014 is intended to give avant-garde space companies the opportunity to develop and test innovative technologies without burdensome regulatory frameworks, similar to how commercial aviation began in the 20th century. The FAA does, however, license commercial rocket launches. But its current role requires it to ensure the safety of bystanders and nearby property \u2014 not focus on protecting the passengers on board. Currently, paying customers who travel to space must sign \u201cinformed consent\u201d documents acknowledging the risks before their flight.",

            "text": "Spirit AeroSystems, a key supplier to Boeing, shut down its factory in Wichita, Kansas, on Thursday after workers represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers voted to strike. The suspended production comes after employees voted down Spirit AeroSystems\u2019 \u201cbest and final offer\u201d and then authorized a strike, according to the union. The work stoppage is set to begin on Saturday. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, or IAM, represents about 6,000 workers at the plant. The contract was rejected by 79% of members and 85% voted to strike, the union said. \u201cThe IAM\u2019s dedicated and hardworking membership at Spirit AeroSystems has worked without fail during tumultuous times, including a pandemic that saw everything grind to a halt. Most of our members have concluded that the company\u2019s offer is unacceptable,\u201d the union said in a statement late Wednesday.  In response, Spirit AeroSystems\n            \n                (SPR) said IAM-represented employees should not report to work on Thursday morning but will receive pay. \u201cWe are disappointed that our employees represented by the IAM rejected our four-year contract offer and voted to strike. We believe that our fair and competitive offer recognizes the contributions of our employees and ensures we can successfully meet increasing demand for aircraft from our customers,\u201d the company noted it its statement. The union is now in the process of polling its members to see where the main concerns and issues with the proposed contract are. Those results are expected in the coming days, the union said.  \u201cWe are anxious to see what our memberships says, and we will try to get their concerns addressed,\u201d said Rickey Wallace, general vice president of the IAM \u2013 Southern Territory. A federal mediator has been assigned to help facilitate discussions and mediate a deal, at the request of the union.   The two sides, who have been negotiating since May, had come to a tentative agreement last week. The proposed deal included a 34% pay increase, continued health insurance, a 14.7% increase in retirement benefits with a new 401k match, voluntary Sunday overtime, and increased time off, according to the union. But rank and file members voted down the contract Wednesday.  Spirit AeroSystems is one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of aerostructures, airplanes including fuselages and wing components. The company supplies parts for seven Boeing models and four Airbus models as well as for Bombardier, Northrop, Bell Helicopter, Mitsubishi and Lockheed. \u201cIt\u2019s a concern,\u201d said Wallace of being able to service Spirit AeroSystems\u2019 clients. \u201cOur wish is to get this resolved as soon as possible and get our members back to work and get Spirit AeroSystems moving again.\u201d Analysts suggest an even more robust financial contract for workers will have inflationary implications for the rest of the industry.  \u201cWe don\u2019t know the price to make these workers happy. That\u2019s scary,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst and managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \u201cThis is an industry that\u2019s been deflationary for decades. This is new terrain.\u201d The IAM and Spirit AeroSystems are coming off a 10-year contract agreement negotiated in 2010, with a three-year extension in 2020.  \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since the parties have been to the table. Some of it\u2019s frustration over that,\u201d Wallace said of the membership\u2019s vote not to ratify the deal. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly rich contract offer.\u201d The strike is scheduled to begin at 12:01 am CT on Saturday June 24 when IAM\u2019s current contract with Spirit AeroSystems expires. The two sides say they still intend to meet at the bargaining table again soon.  ",

            "title": "The A380 was nearly extinct. Now a new airline says it\u2019s building a superjumbo-only fleet",
            "text": "The pandemic almost killed it and its production ended sooner than anticipated in 2021, but the A380 simply refuses to die. With more and more superjumbos soaring back into the skies amid a post-pandemic resurgence in commercial aviation, the aircraft is back in the spotlight as one new airline is built around it. Global Airlines, a British startup that aims to offer transatlantic flights starting next year, has acquired a 16-year-old A380 as the inaugural aircraft of an all-A380 fleet \u2014 at least initially \u2014 and is in the process of refurbishing the plane to its own specifications. It\u2019s a rare used-market move for an aircraft that passengers adore but that airlines have struggled to turn profitable due to its operating and maintenance cost, as well as its huge size. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic aircraft when you use it in the right way and on the right routes,\u201d says Global Airlines CEO James Asquith. \u201cWe will be looking to invest significant amounts on refurbishing the A380 we already have and the future ones that we\u2019re looking to bring into the fleet.\u201d Asquith previously founded Holiday Swap, a home-swapping travel platform which is also Global\u2019s parent company, and he holds the Guinness world record for the youngest person to visit every country in the world. \u201cI\u2019ve flown on about 280 different airlines and sat there seeing what\u2019s good, what doesn\u2019t work and what can be improved,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve structured this in a way that financially allows us to do a lot of the exciting things that no new airline that isn\u2019t government-funded has been able to do in the last 40 years.\u201d How much did it cost? The purchased A380 was among the earliest ever made and was originally delivered to Singapore Airlines in 2008. After 10 years of service, Singapore ended its lease agreement with the aircraft owner, German aircraft trading company Doric, which then leased it to Portuguese charter operation Hi Fly. It was then marketed as the only A380 in the world available for charter. The plane then flew with a handful of airlines, including Norwegian, Madagascan Airlines and Air Senegal. In mid-2020 Hi Fly partially converted it to cargo, hoping to benefit from the peak in demand for air freight brought on by the pandemic. However, in late 2020, the Portuguese company ended the lease and returned the A380 to Doric. Since then, the aircraft had been waiting for a buyer at two French airports, in Toulouse and Lourdes, which have specially designed areas for long-term storage. Airbus built 251 A380s \u2013 far fewer than the 750 it originally hoped to make \u2013 and retirement has certainly started early for this model compared to what\u2019s typical for a widebody aircraft \u2013 around 20 to 25 years. The first one was scrapped in 2019, just 12 years after the first commercial flight. Its second-hand market is almost non-existent and used A380s have always struggled to find buyers. Global Airlines is the first new airline to operate the A380 since All Nippon Airways in 2019, and the first ever to do so with a used aircraft. \u201cNot all A380s are the same,\u201d says Asquith when asked why he picked this particular A380 among those that were up for sale. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not just looking at the cabin or the interiors for that, but also the maintenance side of things, how new is the landing gear, and most importantly, the engines.\u201d Global and Doric are not disclosing the sale price beyond the fact that it\u2019s \u201ceight figures.\u201d According to Rob Morris, head of consultancy at aviation analytics firm Cirium, the value of the plane is linked to its maintenance condition, and can be as little as $10 million, if every component is fully run-out, and as much as $40 million, if the aircraft is in perfect shape. Either way, Global will have to spend more money to refurbish the plane, which has already been painted in its new livery, and make it fit for passenger service, meaning the final price tag could easily run in the $50 million range, Morris argues. That\u2019s still quite a bargain compared to the A380\u2019s list price of $450 million, for a brand new aircraft, in 2018. Flying in style Starting an airline is a challenging business proposition and doing it with an A380 fleet even more so, as the aircraft\u2019s economics have proved to be less than ideal for many of its operators. Air France was the first airline to retire its entire fleet, in May 2020, and 17 A380s have already been scrapped (formerly with Singapore, Qantas, Emirates and Air France itself). UAE flag carrier Emirates is the only airline that has managed to make the plane flourish, and is by far the largest operator, having ordered nearly half of all the A380s ever built. \u201cA lot of people have written about whether the A380 has got another life, but the reality is that the only life it had in the first place was with Emirates,\u201d says Asquith. \u201cThey\u2019ve known how to use the aircraft phenomenally. Big plane does not equal lots of seats. It\u2019s more what you can offer on the product.\u201d But Global isn\u2019t taking too many cues from Emirates; for example, it won\u2019t offer a premium economy class, which the Middle Eastern carrier has recently added to over 60 of its existing A380s. \u201cI\u2019ve never personally been an advocate of the premium economies of the world for many reasons \u2014 the economics of it work fantastically well for airlines, but not very well for passengers,\u201d Asquith says. \u201cAs someone who is primarily a passenger before being a manager of an airline, I want a better product across the Atlantic and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing.\u201d Instead, Global will focus on a three-class cabin with regular economy, business and first class. Gone are the plans for a \u201cgamer class\u201d \u2014 seats equipped with Xbox and PlayStation consoles \u2014 which the airline was mulling about last year, but economy is going to get special consideration, as it \u201creally hasn\u2019t had enough evolution in the past 30 or so years,\u201d Asquith says. The airline will be based at London\u2019s Gatwick airport \u2014 suggesting a non-business target demographic \u2014 and primarily run transatlantic routes with North America, starting with New York and Los Angeles. There\u2019s a plan to expand to other UK cities too, which Asquith says are drastically underserved, and he hopes to launch in spring 2024, with at least two A380s in operation. The CEO is also quick to dismiss any similarities with previous, and unsuccessful, transatlantic startups such as Norwegian and Wow, and current ones like Norse, which operates a fleet of 10 Boeing 787s offering flights from European cities including Oslo and London to half a dozen US destinations, as well as Jamaica, Thailand and Barbados. But while Norse \u2014 and competitors such as Play from Iceland and Fly Atlantic from Northern Ireland \u2014 position themselves as low-cost airlines, Global seems more inclined to offer a curated product to discerning travelers, with maybe even a touch of nostalgia for times past. \u201cHaving a race to the bottom in terms of price isn\u2019t necessarily beneficial for the longer-term growth of the industry,\u201d Asquith says. \u201cPrice competition should also be matched with an increase in quality. We think that there\u2019s a big opportunity to create a product on board that is not as dense as some of the carriers. It is magical that you can go and fly between continents in six to eight hours, and I think we shouldn\u2019t forget how special that is.\u201d Chances of success According to analyst Rob Morris, it\u2019s not going to be easy for Global Airlines to fill the 484 seats it plans to configure its A380s with. \u201cThe A380 is an aircraft for flag carriers with a few very dense routes and a certain cost and revenue profile,\u201d he says, \u201cBut for secondary markets, we never thought it would have much success, in the same way the 747-400 never had much success as a passenger aircraft. I\u2019m struggling to see what Global can see that others have not seen in the past. It\u2019s a very brave move. It\u2019s going to be very costly. I wish good luck, of course, but I just find it hard to see a success scenario for the airline.\u201d \u201cStarting up a new, very small international airline has certainly been done before, with no examples of success,\u201d says Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at AeroDynamic Advisory. \u201cThey go after a few routes, and even if they somehow get any traction, they\u2019re easily crushed by the big players. It\u2019s far easier for a successful, low-cost domestic carrier to expand into international routes, as JetBlue is doing.\u201d Asquith is aware of these challenges, but he seems convinced that the exact combination of factors that make up Global Airlines, from the choice of aircraft to his personnel \u2014 he recently appointed former US Air Force and UK Civilian Aviation Authority officials to key roles \u2014 are positioning him for success. \u201cIf you look back at four years ago, let\u2019s say, most new airlines would lease a very old aircraft and have a product that genuinely isn\u2019t a head turner at the start,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we live in a bit of a different environment now, where aviation commentary is quite viral and people have a lot of opinions. \u201cThe very key thing that we obviously want to be doing is putting out a very strong product to start with and one that we think is the best across the Atlantic. A smaller aircraft would just not be what we are as a brand.\u201d He adds that Global can \u201cfill that aircraft probably 65% and still be fine,\u201d and that people really go out of their way to fly on an A380. The plane is continuing to enjoy a steady post-pandemic comeback, with 141 A380s \u2013 about 60% of the remaining global fleet \u2013 currently in service with nine airlines. The latest to reinstate it in its schedule is Lufthansa, whose inaugural Munich to Boston A380 service was among the most tracked flights of the day on Flightradar24. Overall, Asquith appears to be invigorated, rather than spooked, by criticism: \u201cWhen I went and visited every country in the world, every single person including my parents told me it was impossible to do,\u201d he says. \u201cI think everybody needs to understand that we\u2019re doing this to create jobs, to create competition and a better product. Why would people not want that?\u201d",

Now, for the fifth time in the accolades\u2019 23-year history, it\u2019s been named best airline in the prestigious Skytrax World Airline Awards 2023. The announcement came at a gala on June 20 at the Air and Space Museum at the Paris Air Show, just weeks after the Singapore flag carrier was named No.5 in the world by aviation safety and product rating agency AirlineRatings.com. \u201cSingapore Airlines achieved excellent results in many of the award categories, with the highlight being recognition of their First Class cabin as the World\u2019s Best First Class,\u201d said Edward Plaisted, CEO of Skytrax. To gather this year\u2019s results, the UK-based aviation consultancy conducted independent self-funded customer surveys across more than 325 airlines worldwide between September 2022 and May 2023. Goh Choon Phong, CEO of Singapore Airlines, said the win was down to the tireless work of his team, who made \u201cmany sacrifices to ensure that SIA was ready for the recovery in air travel. That has allowed us to emerge stronger and fitter from the pandemic.\u201d Best in class Qatar Airways \u2013 a seven-time Airline of the Year winner \u2013 was No.2 this year, followed by Japan\u2019s ANA All Nippon Airways in third position, Emirates fourth and Japan Airlines in fifth place. The Qatar flag carrier bossed it in business class, with wins for World\u2019s Best Business Class, World\u2019s Best Business Class Seat, World\u2019s Best Business Class Lounge (the Al Mourjan lounge at Hamad International Airport), World\u2019s Best Business Class Lounge Dining and Best Airline in the Middle East. ANA cleaned up with the award for the highest hygiene standards: It was named World\u2019s Cleanest Airline for the third year in a row, as well as scooping the award for World\u2019s Best Airport Services. Kuwait Airways, which just launched a complimentary chauffeur service for first and business class passengers, was named the World\u2019s Most Improved Airline, while AirAsia was named the World\u2019s Best Low-Cost Airline. There were no surprises there, as it\u2019s won the award every single year since 2010. Scoot was the World\u2019s Best Long-Haul Low-Cost Airline and Volotea won out in the very competitive Best Low-Cost Airline in Europe category. Air Canada triumphed in the new World\u2019s Most Family-Friendly Airline category, which covers such things as family seating policies, priority boarding and children\u2019s amenities. Garuda Indonesia\u2019s cabin staff were voted the world\u2019s best, Cathay Pacific won World\u2019s Best Inflight Entertainment and Bangkok Airways was once again the World\u2019s Best Regional Airline. Delta Air Lines was named Best Airline in North America, with the Best Airline Staff Service for the region, while Sun Country Airlines was named Best Low-Cost Airline in North America title for the first time Alaska Airlines was North America\u2019s Best Regional Airline.

            "text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Tuesday the company is looking to invest in India \u201cas soon as humanly possible,\u201d following a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York. \u201c[Modi] really cares about India because he\u2019s pushing us to make significant investments in India, which is something we intend to do. We are just trying to figure out the right timing,\u201d Musk told reporters. \u201cI am confident that Tesla will be in India and will do so as soon as humanly possible,\u201d he said, without specifying a timeline. Musk said he tentatively plans to visit India next year. Musk\u2019s push into the Indian market has been in the works for a long time. Back in 2017, the CEO said that Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) was planning to sell cars in India as soon as that summer. But that plan has been delayed because of Tesla\u2019s efforts to negotiate lower import duties with local government. Musk tweeted in 2021 that Tesla wanted to enter India, \u201cbut import duties are the highest in the world by far of any large country.\u201d Tesla had sought to slash the duties, but the Indian government reportedly wants the company to make cars locally before considering any tax breaks, according to Reuters.  On Tuesday, Musk said he had a \u201cfantastic meeting\u201d with the Modi and feels \u201cincredibly excited about the future of India.\u201d \u201c[Modi] really wants to do the right thing for India. He wants to be open, he wants to be supportive to the companies. And obviously, at the same time, make sure that it accrues to India\u2019s advantage,\u201d Musk said. Tesla currently has one gigafactory in Asia, which is located in Shanghai. The Shanghai factory is Tesla\u2019s biggest car manufacturing plant outside the United States and accounted for more than half of Tesla\u2019s global deliveries in 2022.  Last month, Musk said at an event that the company would likely pick a location for a new Tesla factory by the end of the year and that India was an interesting option, Reuters reported at the time. Both China and India have been trying to attract global EV investment and boost the EV industry. On Wednesday, China announced it would extend tax breaks for consumers buying new energy vehicles \u2014 which include battery electric cars, plug-in hybrids, and fuel-cell vehicles \u2014 through 2027, in its latest effort to boost sales and production in the world\u2019s biggest EV market. The current policy allows purchase tax exemption on NEVs until the end of 2023.  The tax break is estimated to reach 520 billion yuan ($72.3 billion) from 2024 to 2027, said Xu Hongcai, vice minister of finance, at a press conference in Beijing on Wednesday. The move follows a State Council meeting earlier this month, during which senior officials said they would study policies to promote NEV development and optimize tax exemption. From May 30 to June 1, Musk made his first visit to China since the pandemic and met a string of government officials to discuss EV development and Tesla\u2019s operations in the country. He also visited the Shanghai gigafactory, thanking the workers and saying that they make the \u201chighest quality\u201d Tesla cars around the world, with the \u201cmost efficient production.\u201d Before leaving, Musk also met Chen Jining, the Communist Party chief of Shanghai, who encouraged him to boost investment and operations and \u201cbring more new products, new technologies and new services\u201d to the city, according to a statement by the government.",

            "text": "Alibaba is replacing Daniel Zhang as chairman and CEO as the Chinese tech giant undergoes the biggest shakeup in its history.  Joseph Tsai, executive vice chairman and a co-founder of Alibaba\n            \n                (BABA), will succeed Zhang as chairman, the company said Tuesday. Eddie Wu, chairman of e-commerce unit Taobao and Tmall Group, will succeed Zhang as chief executive officer. Both appointments will take effect in September, and Zhang will continue to serve as the chairman and CEO of Alibaba\u2019s cloud unit.  This is the second time Alibaba has undergone a major change in executive leadership in a few years after co-founder Jack Ma stepped away in 2019. And it comes just months after the company announced its biggest restructuring in 24 years. The company said in March that it was splitting into six separate units, including cloud, e-commerce, logistics, media and entertainment. Each unit is now overseen by its own CEO and board directors, and most of them can pursue separate listings or fundraisings.  \u201cThis is the right time for me to make a transition, given the importance of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group as it progresses towards a full spin-off,\u201d Zhang said in the announcement. He has been Alibaba CEO since 2015. He added that the emergence of generative AI has opened up \u201cexciting new opportunities\u201d for the company\u2019s cloud business. Wu, also a co-founder of Alibaba, served as the technology director at the company\u2019s inception in 1999.  \u201cWhile our current transformation brings in a new corporate organizational and governance structure, Alibaba\u2019s mission remains unchanged,\u201d he said. Zhang was appointed by Alibaba as CEO in May 2015, eight years after he joined the company. In 2019, he replaced Jack Ma as the executive chairman, as Ma retired on his birthday and the 20th anniversary of the company as he had promised. Alibaba is China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, boasting more than 900 million active users annually on its Taobao and Tmall platforms. It also operates the country\u2019s biggest cloud computing and digital payment platforms. But the company, along with its co-founder Ma, has been at the center of a sweeping crackdown by Beijing in recent years.  After Ma criticized Chinese financial regulators in a public speech in late 2020, Beijing called off the blockbuster IPO of Ant Group, the affiliate of Alibaba that owns Alipay, at the last minute. The cancellation marked the start of a regulatory onslaught against the country\u2019s internet industry and the private sector, during which Beijing imposed a record fine of $2.8 billion on Alibaba Group for violating antitrust rules. Since then, Ma had largely disappeared from public view and retreated further from his companies. He has reportedly spent more time overseas, including in Hong Kong and Japan, home to his friend and Alibaba investor, SoftBank CEO Masa Son. But in March, he made a surprising public appearance in mainland China, days before Alibaba announced its major restructuring plan. His return was a symbolic move and probably a \u201cplanned media event\u201d by Beijing intended to appease private sector fears, according to analysts. Since then, Ma has shown up in public more frequently, with a more visible focus on researching and teaching. In April, the University of Hong Kong announced that Ma would join its business school for the next three years. Last week, Ma gave his first lecture as a visiting professor to the University of Tokyo, according to a statement from the university.",

The French aerospace giant announced Monday that budget Indian airline IndiGo had placed an order for 500 of its A320 planes, to be delivered between 2030 and 2035.  The deal sets \u201cthe record for the biggest single purchase agreement in the history of commercial aviation,\u201d Airbus\n            \n                (EADSY) said in a statement, and brings the total number of Airbus\n            \n                (EADSY) planes IndiGo has ordered to 1,330.  Founded in 2006, IndiGo is India\u2019s top airline by market share, according to its website. It flew 86 million customers in the last financial year.  Aviation companies are eager to capitalize on India\u2019s strong economy and its booming population, which may well translate into higher demand for air travel further down the line. In February, IndiGo\u2019s rival Air India ordered more than 470 jets from Airbus and Boeing\n            \n                (BA).  Tech companies have also got the memo, with some expanding production and opening new stores in the country in anticipation of huge growth in their pool of customers.  The International Monetary Fund expects the South Asian nation to outperform all major emerging and advanced economies this year, logging 5.9% growth in gross domestic product. The United Nations also estimated in April that India was on track to overtake China to become the world\u2019s most populous nation by the middle of the year, with 1.43 billion people.  Pieter Elbers, IndiGo\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that Monday\u2019s order would help the company \u201cfulfill its mission to continue to boost economic growth, social cohesion and mobility in India.\u201d Three quarters of IndiGo\u2019s flights travel to domestic destinations.

            "text": "Most sustainability experts will scoff at the idea of \u201csustainable\u201d and \u201cairlines\u201d in the same sentence. \u201cToday, at this moment, it\u2019s not yet realistic to fly fully sustainably,\u201d says Pedro Piris-Cabezas, a global transportation expert and economist at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. Yet that doesn\u2019t mean the airline industry isn\u2019t showing growing self-awareness around its environmental impacts and the increasingly urgent calls for transformation in the face of an intensifying climate crisis. \u201cIn the past few years, public awareness of aviation\u2019s climate impact has definitely put pressure on airlines to strengthen their sustainability strategy,\u201d says Sola Zheng, an aviation researcher at the nonprofit International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT). She says that combined pressure from consumers and investors, along with expanding climate regulations, has given the industry \u201ca strong push towards airline decarbonization efforts.\u201d And environmentalists say that shift is coming not a moment too soon. Commercial aviation, which transported more than 4.5 billion passengers annually pre-pandemic, is behind 2.5% of global CO2 emissions each year, with significantly increased flight demand \u2013 and related emissions \u2013 forecasted. \u201cIf aviation were a country, it would be one of the world\u2019s top 10 sources of greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d says Piris-Cabezas. In response, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global trade association representing some 300 global airlines, approved a resolution in 2021 to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 \u2013 meaning it would remove from the atmosphere at least as much planet-warming pollution as it emits \u2013 in line with high-stakes UN-set targets laid out to ensure a \u201clivable climate.\u201d New and proposed government regulation is also trying to sculpt the industry\u2019s transition, particularly in Europe, where some short-haul flights have already been banned, while Denmark and Sweden plan to eliminate fossil fuels on domestic flights by 2030. \u201cThe industry and regulators are in agreement that net-zero needs to be reached by 2050,\u201d says Nicolas Jammes, spokesperson for IATA. \u201cThe industry doesn\u2019t have a choice. It has to be sustainable if it wants to carry on growing, or keep operating the way it does.\u201d Akbar Al Baker, CEO of Qatar Airways, told CNN recently that the airline industry\u2019s emissions goals amounted to a \u201cPR exercise,\u201d with aviation is on track to miss the 2050 deadline. \u201cLet us not fool ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not even reach the targets we have for 2030, I assure you. Because there is not enough raw material to get the volumes of SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel).\u201d The biggest part of the problem: aviation\u2019s continued reliance on fossil fuel-powered planes. \u201cFlying sustainably requires the use of alternative energy,\u201d says Zheng. Accordingly, airlines are banking big on a patchwork of greener alternative fuel sources to slash carbon emissions from future flights, including next-generation technologies like electric, hybrid, and, further out, hydrogen. \u201cThere are a set of emerging technologies that have great potential to decarbonize the sector, but they are in the early stage,\u201d says Zheng. Offering more immediate adoptability \u2013 and the backbone to the industry\u2019s broader decarbonization goals \u2013 is low-carbon sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, a biofuel alternative made from waste products and renewable biomass that can cut emissions by as much as 80%. Currently being tested on dozens of airlines, with SAF mandates upcoming in the European Union, the fuel is projected to meet 65% of commercial aviation\u2019s 2050 net-zero targets. \u201cIt\u2019s a critical element \u2013 the reason being is that it\u2019s the only proven solution at the moment to decarbonize,\u201d says Jammes. Yet SAF faces supply limitations, hefty expense and environmental concerns around low-integrity production; it only made up 0.1% of the world\u2019s total jet fuel consumption in 2021, according to data from ICCT. Ultimately, environmentalists advise that aviation\u2019s decarbonization overhaul is in its infancy, and that for the time being, eco-conscious travelers \u2013 who are showing increasing concern around the hefty carbon footprints of flying \u2013 need to choose to fly less and consider alternative, more climate-friendly means of transportation and travel. Zheng says travelers who do fly should seek out less-emitting flights, noting that travel search engines like Google Flights and Kayak can now display projected per-passenger CO2 emissions alongside flight search results. She also advises against purchasing an airline\u2019s controversial carbon offset programs, which she says are oftentimes unvetted and allow for a business-as-usual approach, and instead look into verified SAF airline credit buy-ins as they become available. Piris-Cabezas cautions that industry greenwashing abounds, and that consumers should also strive to check the credentials of airline claims and to press airlines for greater transparency around sustainability. \u201cAirlines\u2019 \u2018green claims\u2019 are often multiplying more quickly than their fact-checking departments care to back up with substantive evidence,\u201d he says. Zheng concurs, adding, \u201cUntil we see actual decarbonization happen and have the rate of decarbonizing overtake the growth in traffic, it is very misleading to label anyone in the aviation industry sustainable.\u201d Yet Jammes says air travelers can expect to see a rapidly improving landscape around airline sustainability. \u201cIt won\u2019t come without challenges, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d and customers must \u201cunderstand that it can\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d but he says that when it comes to new sustainability-minded technologies, \u201cthe future is going to be exciting.\u201d While airlines have much work to do yet, these seven carriers have introduced an array of sustainability measures\u00a0including the early adoption of alternative-fuel technology, plastic and food waste-reduction programs, SAF credits, eco-friendly materials, and more. United Airlines United plans to introduce a regional US flight service aboard 100 30-passenger hybrid-electric planes, from Swedish startup Heart Aerospace, by 2028. It\u2019s one of several innovative electric- and hydrogen-technology development partnerships that the airline is backing, while it\u2019s also invested in the production of 5 billion gallons of SAF, including biofuel sourced from microalgae \u2013 the largest airline commitment worldwide. United also recently rolled out a Sustainable Flight Fund that allows passengers and corporate partners to buy into SAF development, while its website now displays estimated CO2 emissions alongside flight search results. Wider\u00f8e Norway-based Wider\u00f8e, the largest regional airline in Scandinavia, says it is on track to become one of the world\u2019s first fully emissions-free airlines. An all-electric aircraft-development partnership between the airline, engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce and Italian aerospace company Tecnam is set to replace the airline\u2019s entire domestic fleet by 2028, with the first flights on 11-passenger electric commuter planes poised for 2026. (Norway plans for all short-haul domestic flights to be electric by 2040.) SAS While many airlines have been teasing electric flights, Scandinavian airline SAS is the first to take seat reservations for commercial hybrid-electric flights in 2028, aboard 30-passenger Heart Aerospace planes on routes in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. The airline has ambitious targets that include slashing CO2 emissions by 25% by 2025, before phasing them out entirely in Scandinavia by 2030. The airline is backing various other clean-energy and SAF development projects, and has recently begun offering passengers dedicated fares that bundle in the direct purchase of biofuels, too. Wizz Air European low-cost carrier Wizz Air claims one of the industry\u2019s lowest carbon emissions-impact per passenger, thanks to its younger, fuel-efficient fleet (most of its Airbus A321neo planes are less than five years old), high-occupancy flights and direct route network that omits carbon-emitting connecting flights. The sustainability award-winning\u00a0airline is also investing heavily in SAFs and pursuing hydrogen propulsion aircraft with Airbus. Onboard, Wizz Air passengers can expect biodegradable service items and recycled materials, like the waste-leather seating. Etihad Airways Etihad Airways, one of two national carriers for the United Arab Emirates, has slashed CO2 emissions by a quarter since 2019 thanks to improved operational efficiencies, and has also reduced single-use plastics by 80%. The airline additionally partners with Boeing as part of the decarbonization-focused \u201cGreenliner\u201d program, using the carrier\u2019s fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners as testbeds for SAF and other eco-friendly technologies. Etihad has a similarly themed \u201cSustainable50\u201d program dedicated to its Airbus A350s. Looking ahead, the airline is hoping to integrate SAF sourced from CO2, while it has planted tens of thousands of carbon-absorbing trees as part of its Etihad Mangrove Forest project. The innovations have not gone unnoticed: Etihad was named the \u201cEnvironmental Airline of the Year\u201d for both 2022 and 2023 by rating agency AirlineRatings.com. Alaska Airlines While most major global airlines are targeting 2050 for net-zero carbon emissions, Alaska Airlines intends to meet that target as soon as 2040. To do so, the airline is laser-focused on fuel efficiency and has invested heavily in SAF (including CO2-derived versions). It\u2019s also announced a partnership with the US-headquartered hydrogen-electric aircraft developer ZeroAvia to retrofit one of their regional aircraft as a hybrid hydrogen-electric plane. Customers will also notice single-use plastics reduction on board, like boxed water instead of plastic water bottles and paper cups instead of plastic ones; the line also composts select food waste like coffee grounds. Air Canada Canadian flag carrier Air Canada is targeting 2028 for electric flight, with a purchase agreement in place for 30 of Heart Aerospace\u2019s 30-passenger hybrid-electric planes, which will service regional routes. The airline has also made sizable investments to accelerate the production of SAF in Canada, and has significantly reduced single-use plastics onboard (in line with Canada\u2019s move to ban most single-use plastics by year\u2019s end).",

            "title": "Qantas reveals economy seats for 19-hour NYC-Sydney ultra long-haul flights",
            "text": "As Qantas counts down to the 2025 launch of its record-breaking passenger flights connecting Sydney to New York and London direct, the airline has revealed what economy class will look like on the ultra long-haul flights. Speculation has been mounting about the design of the cheaper seats, with many observers questioning whether spending at least 19 hours in such close proximity to other fliers would be worth the time saved by traveling nonstop. At a press conference in New York on Thursday, the airline revealed it will offer passengers more leg room and more space to move around the cabin on the 12 specially designed Airbus A350 planes that will operate the routes. \u201cWe said what we wanted to do with this, that it was to overcome the last tyranny of distance: to have an aircraft that could fly anywhere around the world,\u201d Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told reporters. Getting an aircraft capable of flying up to 21 hours with a full manifest of passengers plus baggage was part of the jigsaw puzzle, Joyce said. Another focus has been to find the best way to look after people on such a long flight. Free WiFi The airline already revealed its business and first class cabins back in February. At the same time it announced its Project Sunrise flights would carry 238 passengers instead of the usual 300-plus when they take to the air in late 2025. It said the layout would include six first class seats in a 1-1-1 configuration, 52 business class seats in 1-2-1, 40 premium economy seats in 2-4-2 and 140 economy seats in 3-3-3. Those economy seats will be an inch longer than standard, the airline revealed on Thursday, giving passengers 33-inches of legroom. Each seat will also have Bluetooth connectivity and free Wi-Fi, which will help with binge-watching TV series on the flight, said Joyce, who revealed he gorged on \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d on his way over to the US from Australia. The economy cabin will also have \u201cwellness zones\u201d with TV screens guiding travelers through stretching exercises and bars to help them balance. Passengers will also be kept awake for much longer at the start of the flight than they currently are thanks to \u201cenergizing food,\u201d lighting and temperature. \u201cWe think this is a unique value proposition as an airline that we\u2019ll be able to offer \u2026 showing people how to have a very healthy trip, to look after the wellness, and to avoid jet lag, and to come into a destination refreshed,\u201d said Joyce. Shortening jet lag The airline has been working with sleep researchers from the University of Sydney\u2019s Charles Perkins Centre. The team studied passengers on three ultra long-haul test flights Qantas conducted in 2019 and found that food and conditions could reduce jet lag. \u201cFirst, we found that the duration of self-reported jetlag is shortened by about two days in the optimized groups compared to the traditional ones,\u201d said Svetlana Postnova, neurophysics and brain dynamics specialist at the University of Sydney. \u201cSecond, we found that alertness in the days immediately following the flight is higher in the optimized group than the traditional one.\u201d As well as studying passengers on test flights, Qantas has also been using data from the flight crew to make the case to Australian aviation regulators that the nonstop routes can be flown safely. Joyce said the reduction in seat numbers was a crucial part of the equation. \u201cThis aircraft has a lot less seats, more premium seats, and a lot more space for customers because we believe that\u2019s the level of comfort that\u2019s needed when you\u2019re doing ultra long-haul travel,\u201d said Joyce. At the front of the planes, first class passengers will enjoy an extra-wide bed, a 22-inch wide recliner lounge chair, a full-length wardrobe, a folding dining table \u2013 large enough for two \u2013 and a 32-inch ultra-high-definition TV. Joyce jokingly said first class pods were equipped with \u201c\u2026everything except the dunny (Australian slang for toilet) on board.\u201d Into the record books Business class suites will be 42 inches wide with 25-inch-wide chairs that can be reclined into a two-meter bed. They will also include a cushioned leather ottoman, a large mirror, plenty of storage space and an 18-inch ultra-high-definition touchscreen. The Project Sunrise flights take their name from high-risk clandestine flights during World War II that saw two sunrises as they made their way from Perth to Sri Lanka en route to London. During Qantas research flights in 2019, pilots wore brainwave monitors and had urine tested in the weeks before and after the flights to track levels of melatonin, a hormone linked to sleep cycles. Passengers in the main cabin wore monitoring devices, allowing scientists to study how their \u201chealth, well-being and body clock\u201d were impacted by variables including lighting, food and drink, movement, sleep patterns and inflight entertainment. One of the trial flights, Flight QF7879 \u2013 which CNN experienced first-hand \u2013 became the world\u2019s longest passenger flight by a commercial airline both for distance (17,800 kilometers, or about 11,060 miles) and duration in the air (19 hours and 19 minutes). The current world\u2019s longest scheduled passenger flight currently in service, that honor goes to Singapore Airlines\u2019 Singapore-JFK flight, which covers 9,536.5 miles. Flights from Singapore to JFK take 18 hours and 5 minutes, while JFK to Singapore takes 18 hours and 40 minutes, due to the headwind.",

            "title": "India demonstrates naval strength with dual aircraft carrier exercise, a feat China has yet to accomplish",
            "text": "India\u2019s two aircraft carriers led their battle groups in a combined operation in the Arabian Sea earlier this week, showcasing what the service calls its \u201cformidable maritime capabilities\u201d and ability to project power around the Indian Ocean and beyond. Analysts say it\u2019s a big accomplishment and one that only the United States Navy has pulled off in recent memory. \u201cThis is not a small achievement and underlines that the Indian Navy is one of very few in the world that operates more than one aircraft carrier,\u201d said Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). The two aircraft carriers, INS Vikramaditya and INS Vikrant, led the exercise with more than 35 aircraft and an array of surface ships and submarines, according to a press release from the Indian Navy. \u201cThe successful demonstration of two-carrier battle group operations serves as a powerful testament to the pivotal role of sea-based air power in maintaining maritime superiority,\u201d the release said. India became capable of dual-carrier operations when the $3 billion Vikrant, India\u2019s first domestically built carrier, was commissioned last September, joining Vikramaditya, which was bought from Russia and went into service in 2013. Upon Vikrant\u2019s commissioning last year, India joined only the United Kingdom and China in commissioning a domestically built aircraft carrier in the previous three years. But while both China and the UK have more than one aircraft carrier in their modern fleets, neither has yet to perform dual-carrier operations with them, analysts said. Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said India\u2019s naval history may put it ahead of China, whose People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy is the world\u2019s largest, in the current operating environment for aircraft carriers. \u201cThe Indian Navy has had decades-long experience and expertise in aircraft carrier ops and this is probably the key advantage it possesses over the PLA Navy, its key rival in this field, despite the latter\u2019s relative advance in its indigenous aircraft carrier program,\u201d Koh said. China has two aircraft carriers in service, the Soviet-built Liaoning and the domestically built Shandong, while a third carrier, the Fujian, has been launched but not commissioned. Hawaii-based analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain, said India\u2019s dual-carrier operations this week show \u201cthe rejuvenation of the Indian Navy.\u201d India commissioned its first aircraft carrier in 1961 and added a second in 1987. It has operated two aircraft carriers on two previous occasions, between 1987 and 1997, and between 2013 and 2017. \u201cIt should be remembered that the Indian Navy has always been a highly trained, tightly disciplined and very proficient force,\u201d Schuster said. The Indian Navy press release called the carriers \u201cfloating sovereign airfields,\u201d adding that \u201cthey provide our friends with an assurance that the Indian Navy is capable and ready to support our \u2018collective\u2019 security needs in the region.\u201d New Delhi\u2019s forces have been stepping up cooperation with other navies in the Indo-Pacific, including those in the informal Quad partnership \u2013 the United States, Japan and Australia \u2013 in the annual Malabar naval exercises. \u201cIndia\u2019s partnerships and collaborative exercises with other navies have broadened the navy\u2019s operational knowledge and open ocean experiences,\u201d Schuster said. What the Indian Navy can learn about dual-carrier operations from the United States could be substantial. The US Navy operates the world\u2019s largest carrier fleet \u2013 11 warships \u2013 and just last week had two of those, the USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan, operating together in the Philippine Sea. The US Navy sees China as a \u201cpacing threat\u201d in the Indo-Pacific, and India\u2019s naval operations look toward China too, Schuster said. \u201cChina\u2019s aggression along the (shared Himalayan) border and expanding operations and presence in the Indian Ocean have become India\u2019s most serious security concern. The naval expansion and modernization is intended to address that concern,\u201d Schuster said. But even with the advancements demonstrated by the dual-carrier operation, India\u2019s carrier program still has question marks, said Childs from IISS. \u201cWhile an impressive-looking display, there may be some question over what this really amounts to as yet in terms of actual operational capability,\u201d he said, noting that images from the Indian operation showed relatively few fighter aircraft on the decks of the Vikramaditya and Vikrant. \u201cThis may indicate limited aircraft availability, or that the ships\u2019 capacities are somewhat constrained at the moment. It would certainly suggest that the Indian Navy could do with more carrier aircraft,\u201d Childs said. ",

            "title": "Forget space tourism. This company wants to make drug manufacturing the next big extraterrestrial business",
            "text": "For years, the private sector has envisioned an illustrious future in space \u2014 an extraterrestrial playground with tourists flying to and from orbiting hotels and the occasional trip to Mars being as easy as a transatlantic flight. But if the space economy is to become a $1 trillion sector by 2040, as one Citigroup report suggested, not all of its enterprises will be so grandiose. One California-based startup, Varda Space Industries, is betting that big business will lie in relatively unassuming satellites that will spend days or months in Earth\u2019s orbit quietly carrying out pharmaceutical development. Its research, company officials hope, could lead to better, more effective drugs \u2014 and hefty profits. \u201cIt\u2019s not as sexy a human-interest story as tourism when it comes to commercialization of the cosmos,\u201d said Will Bruey, Varda\u2019s CEO and cofounder. \u201cBut the bet that we\u2019re making at Varda is that manufacturing is actually the next big industry that gets commercialized.\u201d Varda launched its first test mission Monday aboard a SpaceX rocket, which took off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California just after 2:30 pm PT. The company then confirmed in a tweet that its satellite successfully separated from the rocket. On board the rocket, tucked among a bevy of other satellites, was the company\u2019s first creation: a 200-pound (90-kilogram) capsule designed to carry drug research into microgravity. If successful, Varda hopes to scale its business rapidly, sending regular flights of satellites into orbit stuffed with experiments on behalf of pharmaceutical companies. Eventually, the firm hopes that research will yield a golden ticket drug, one that proves to be better when manufactured in space and can return royalties to Varda for years to come. The core of this idea \u2014 manufacturing pharmaceuticals in microgravity \u2014 builds on experiments carried out on the International Space Station, which is operated by astronauts but hosts experiments from a range of private companies and research institutions. Big pharma firms, including Merck and Bristol Myers Squibb, have sent experiments there, working with the ISS National Laboratory. And some of this work may lead to changes in the drugs that people on Earth take today. But whether Varda\u2019s ambitious business plan is viable will depend on numerous technological and financial questions. How it works Varda\u2019s vision is straightforward: The company\u2019s capsule will launch with an experiment already on board. Once in orbit, the capsule detaches and begins flying through space attached to what\u2019s called a satellite bus, a structure that will provide the power, propulsion and communications necessary to navigate the vacuum of space. (For Varda\u2019s first few missions, the satellite bus will be provided by another commercial space company, Rocket Lab.) Then the experiment begins, carried out by simple on-board machines. The goal is to create key components of pharmaceuticals while in microgravity. In this weightless environment, such experiments aren\u2019t bogged down by Earth\u2019s pull. Research has already established that protein crystals grown in space can form more perfect structures compared with those grown on Earth. These space-formed crystals can then be used to create pharmaceuticals that the human body could more easily absorb \u2014 or overall better-performing drugs. One key example, from research Merck carried out on the International Space Station, is the active ingredient pembrolizumab used in the cancer drug Keytruda. Scientists found that using crystals formed in space could create a more stable drug, one that could be administered by a shot rather than the time-consuming intravenous injection currently used. (Merck used that research to inform other Earth-based studies, but the findings have not yet been applied to drugs on the market, the company told CNN on Friday.) Varda\u2019s first mission will focus on research around ritonavir, a drug traditionally used to treat HIV but more recently included in the antiviral medication Paxlovid to fight Covid-19. After Varda\u2019s experiment is finished, engineers on the ground will evaluate if the capsule is ready for return. If they give a final \u201cgo,\u201d the satellite bus will push the capsule back toward Earth. The capsule then will plummet into Earth\u2019s atmosphere and parachute to a gentle landing, where the pharmaceutical materials can be recovered. This mission won\u2019t be easy. Varda will have to prove its robotics can carry out these experiments remotely. On the space station, astronauts with keen eyes and dexterous hands have overseen such research. These robotics will also have to survive the jolting forces of a rocket launch. The return home will be difficult as well: Blazing back into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere at roughly 18,000 miles per hour will create extreme heat and a buildup of plasma. It\u2019s widely considered the most dangerous leg of any journey to space. The odds of success on this first attempt? \u201cProbably less than 90%, but better than a coin flip,\u201d said Bruey, Varda\u2019s CEO. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s probably the most honest answer.\u201d Varda\u2019s roadmap By space industry standards, Varda\u2019s path to the launchpad has been exceptionally quick. Founded less than three years ago, Varda has gone from an idea to a company with more than $100 million in seed funding and grants, a 68,000-square-foot factory, and a satellite in space. Its workforce has grown to nearly 100 employees. In its favor, the firm has not had to design any step of this process \u2014 launch to landing \u2014 from scratch. SpaceX\u2019s rockets routinely fly to orbit, and the company has made booking a ride to space for a satellite practically as easy as chartering a jet. A payload of Varda\u2019s size \u2014 weighing in at about 300 kilograms (660 pounds) altogether \u2014 costs less than $2 million, according to SpaceX\u2019s website. Varda also has agreements with NASA, signed in August, that allow the company to leverage expertise and even purchase materials from the space agency. Company executives often say they\u2019re standing on the shoulders of giants \u2014 borrowing technology that\u2019s been developed elsewhere. \u201cEvery piece of the puzzle at Varda has been done before,\u201d Bruey said. \u201cReentry has been done before. The in-space manufacturing has been done on the (International Space Station) before.\u201d Bruey has played a role in that progress. He spent about six years at SpaceX, including working on the company\u2019s Dragon capsule, which now regularly flies humans and cargo to and from orbit. Delian Asparouhov, Varda\u2019s cofounder and president, credited Bruey\u2019s experience as the reason for approaching him to form this new company. Asparouhov is a partner at Founders Fund, the venture capital outfit started by PayPal cofounder and Elon Musk ally Peter Thiel. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this idea around microgravity manufacturing for almost a decade,\u201d Asparouhov said. And in 2020, Asparouhov said he was searching for someone to team up with on that business. SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rockets were launching at a rapid clip. Getting a satellite to space was quicker and cheaper than ever. (Citigroup\u2019s recent report estimates the price of launching a satellite is now 30 times lower than it was in the 1980s.) That made the moment ripe for taking the plunge on this new venture, Asparouhov said. \u201cI reached out to a handful of people that worked at SpaceX, actually asking them, \u2018Hey, who\u2019s got really great leadership experience, worked on Crew and Cargo Dragon\u2019 \u2014 given that we need to build our own reentry capsules,\u201d he said. \u201cBruey\u2019s name kept being top of the list.\u201d Varda was formed shortly after the two met in the summer of 2020. Initially, Asparouhov\u2019s vision was much broader than pharmaceuticals. He pictured other products \u2014 such as fiber optics and semiconductors \u2014 being manufactured in space, yielding better quality materials than those made terrestrially. But those business plans were left on the cutting room floor \u2014\u00a0at least for now. Pharmaceuticals \u201care the most valuable chemicals per unit mass,\u201d Bruey said. \u201cAnd they also have a large market on Earth.\u201d Asparouhov added: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see Varda do anything other than pharmaceuticals for the next minimum of six, seven years.\u201d Fortune and the future Asparouhov said Varda has spent about $40 million on development so far. And the company has enough cash to fund at least its first four missions, even if they fail. Bruey and Asparouhov said they are hopeful it won\u2019t take more than that to figure out how to get Varda\u2019s technology to work. \u201cI think if we don\u2019t have a successful mission in the first four, we quite frankly don\u2019t deserve to have a space company any longer,\u201d Bruey said. The company does have some high-profile backers. Asparouhov\u2019s other employer, Founders Fund, has added to the $52 million the company has raised thus far. And the US Air Force has given the company a deal worth up to $60 million, hoping the military can leverage Varda\u2019s research on the reentry process. (Varda is not currently raising additional funds, Asparouhov noted.) Once a success is notched, the company will look for ways to evolve. It will also consider what hardware may be reused from one flight to another, which could save copious amounts of cash. \u201cThe ultimate manifestation (of Varda\u2019s vision) is that we have frequent flights going up and down,\u201d said Nicholas Cialdella, Varda\u2019s head of vehicles and another former SpaceX employee. \u201cIn order to achieve that \u2014 a big piece of that will be reusability. And so that will actually be one of the things that we learn from doing this test flight is that (we find out what) things are reusable.\u201d One day, the company hopes Varda flights will be so common that its capsules will blaze across the night sky every evening, like shooting stars to those on the ground who catch a glimpse. From there, Varda could even look to develop a research platform on a private space station, where pharma researchers could travel themselves. \u201cThe big inflection point of success will be when we put a human being in orbit,\u201d Bruey said, \u201cand they come back with more value or generate more value while they\u2019re up there than it cost to put them up.\u201d Now that the first test vehicle is in space, Varda will be watching it like a hawk. The first goal is to make contact with the satellite bus, which will need to deploy its solar panels and provide power to the Varda capsule. Then the experiments can begin. The capsule will then be sent on its return trip home, likely in mid-July. The company aims to land the vehicle within a 50-mile (80-kilometer) plot of land in the Utah Test and Training Range, about a two-hour drive from Salt Lake City. Drugs in space Much of the legwork for Varda\u2019s drug experimentation can be done on the ground. Leading up to launch, materials that will go to space are put through a series of ground tests. \u201cWe run it through vibration testing, thermal testing, shock testing, vacuum testing,\u201d said Jon Barr, the company\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cMost of the work the company has put in basically the last eight months has been taking those components, redesigning them, ruggedized them, and then running through a whole slate of tests to make sure that they can survive both the vehicle launch and the vehicle reentry.\u201d Varda executives declined to comment on whether the company had officially signed on any clients or name any firms with which it might be working. \u201cWe are primarily focused on the top 20 pharma for clients,\u201d said Mark Herbert, the company\u2019s vice president of biopharma business development, who comes from the pharma world \u2014 not the space world. \u201cAcross those companies, there\u2019s actively about 2,000 drugs being worked on.\u201d Ultimately, pharma companies are concerned with finding the best, most effective drugs, said Eric Lasker, Varda\u2019s head of business development and government relations. And whether the research happens in microgravity or on Earth is irrelevant, which is why Varda needs to show results if it wants to attract interest. \u201cAt the end of the day, pharmaceutical companies don\u2019t care that we\u2019re going up to space,\u201d Lasker said. \u201cThey just care about the results on the other side of it. And so, to them, we are a unique ingredient that we can put in.\u201d In that sense, Varda isn\u2019t a space company, per se. It\u2019s just another platform or tool within the $100 billion-plus-per-year pharmaceutical research industry. Paul Reichert, a research fellow at Merck, said that he met with the company last week. Though Merck hasn\u2019t signed a contract with Varda, Reichert said he was impressed with its business plan but wants to see the company\u2019s technology proven before his firm considers flying an experiment. Right now, access to microgravity research \u2014 even on the International Space Station \u2014 is limited by how few and far between flights to space are offered. Varda\u2019s platform could offer that opportunity at lower price points and at more frequent increments if the company delivers on its promises, Reichert added. \u201cThat is very appealing to me,\u201d he said. And that research could expand beyond just protein crystals, perhaps branching into new territories such as how nanoparticles \u2014 used in vaccines \u2014 can be formed, Reichert said. Looking ahead The average research and development cost for every new drug that enters the market is $1 billion to $2 billion, according to US Congressional Budget Office data. The exorbitant price tag of drug research is often passed on to consumers in the form of eye-popping prices, which frequently draws critical headlines. Herbert said that, down the line, conducting research on Varda\u2019s platform shouldn\u2019t add too much to that research price. \u201cAs the platform develops and as the space industry matures, we expect the cost to drop to get more aligned with traditional solid state formulation studies that our clients would do on the ground today,\u201d he said. Varda will also be looking for drugs far along in the development pipeline, if not already on the market. The goal is to improve those drugs, Asparouhov said, making them more effective. He said that Varda\u2019s deals with pharma companies will be based on receiving royalties in the future: If Varda research yields a better result, the company can then collect funds on sales of that drug indefinitely. So much of this plan remains to be seen: Can Varda\u2019s platform work? Can it survive the return from space? Will it be more cost-effective than sending the same research to the International Space Station? Will big pharma bite? Time will tell. But in the meantime, Bruey and his employees are forging ahead, banking on the future of space to be rich with business opportunities. \u201cYou\u2019ll see like this entire ecosystem coming up to create this fertile ground for commercialization of space,\u201d Bruey said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to be able to build atop of that environment.\u201d",

            "text": "The US believes that an attack drone manufacturing plant Russia is building with Iran\u2019s help could be fully operational by early next year, National Security Council official John Kirby said on Friday. Iran is shipping equipment for the plant, as well as fully-built drones, to Russia via the Caspian Sea, US officials believe. Russia has purchased hundreds of drones from Iran since last summer and is using them extensively in the war in Ukraine.  Kirby confirmed previous CNN reporting that Iran is using the Caspian Sea route to move drones, bullets and mortar shells to Russia, often using vessels that are \u201cdark,\u201d or have turned off their tracking data to disguise their movements.  The US released a map on Friday showing the route Iran appears to be using to ship the equipment from Amirabad, Iran to Makhachkala, Russia.  \u201cRussia has been using Iranian UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) in recent weeks to strike Kyiv and terrorize the Ukrainian population, and the Russia-Iran military partnership appears to be deepening,\u201d Kirby said in a statement. The US also believes that Iran has been shipping materials that Russia has been using to build its own drone factory inside Russia\u2019s Alabuga Special Economic Zone, about 600 miles east of Moscow. The US released a satellite image of the planned location of the purported drone manufacturing plant, taken on April 3. CNN has asked the Russian embassy in Washington and the Iranian mission to the United Nations for comment. \u201cThe support is flowing both ways: from Iran to Russia, and from Russia to Iran,\u201d Kirby said.  \u201cRussia has been offering Iran unprecedented defense cooperation, including on missiles, electronics, and air defense,\u201d he added. \u201cEarlier this year, Iran announced that it had finalized a deal to buy Su-35 fighter jets from Russia. Iran is seeking to purchase additional military equipment from Russia, including attack helicopters, radars, and YAK-130 combat trainer aircraft. In total, Iran is seeking billions of dollars\u2019 worth of military equipment from Russia.\u201d  Kirby said that the US is releasing this information to the public \u201cto expose and disrupt\u201d the countries\u2019 \u201cfull-scale defense partnership.\u201d  He also announced that the US will be issuing a new advisory on Friday to help businesses and governments better understand how Iran is illegally obtaining the components to build its drones, and how they can \u201cput in place measures to ensure they are not inadvertently contributing to Iran\u2019s UAV program.\u201d The US has imposed tough export control restrictions and sanctions to prevent Iran from obtaining the necessary materials for its drones, but evidence has emerged that suggests Iran is finding an abundance of commercially-available technology\u2014including components manufactured by US companies, CNN has reported. The\u202f Biden administration launched an expansive task force last year to investigate how US and western components,\u202fincluding American-made microelectronics, were ending up in Iranian-made drones being used in Russia. Kirby said the US will continue to impose sanctions on Iranians, Russians, and other countries involved in the procurement of the equipment. ",

            "text": "Would you sit directly below another airplane passenger? It might not sound particularly appealing on paper, but 23-year-old airplane seat designer Alejandro N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente believes double-level seating is the future of economy flying. You may have seen a photo of N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente\u2019s Chaise Longue Airplane Seat prototype floating around the internet. Following a CNN Travel exclusive last year, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente\u2019s concept went viral \u2013 igniting furious debate and prompting a flurry of reactions from would-be passengers \u2013 some outraged, some bemused, some intrigued, some all of the above. \u201cTo be honest, there\u2019s no such thing as bad publicity,\u201d N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente tells CNN Travel today. Proving this sentiment, he\u2019s back at the Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) in Hamburg, Germany \u2013 showcasing a new iteration of his controversial Chaise Longue. \u201cPeople can talk and they always hate innovation in some ways,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of the times when they show you something new, everyone hates it at first, they\u2019re scared of change. But the more you show it, and the more you develop it, and the more they see it, the more they get used to it.\u201d N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente\u2019s concept started small \u2013 as a college project back in 2021. A nomination for the 2021 Crystal Cabin Awards \u2013 a top prize in the aviation industry \u2013 catapulted the concept into the public consciousness. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente paused his master\u2019s degree and put all his time, money and efforts into making his vision a reality. Fast forward to today and N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente has sponsors, partnership deals and is in regular conversation with \u201cthe biggest players in the industry.\u201d He believes his double-level airplane seat is the future of economy flying and is working around the clock to make it a reality. Comfort and cabin capacity When would-be passengers wince at the potential claustrophobia and critics suggest the design is all about airlines cramming more seats on planes, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente insists they\u2019ve misunderstood his intentions. For one, he\u2019s not trying to eradicate regular airplane seating altogether. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente envisages an airplane cabin in which the Chaise Longue is in the center, flanked by two rows of regular airplane seating. He\u2019s conscious the seat wouldn\u2019t be suitable or appealing for everyone, even if he thinks it could be more comfortable for some passengers. At 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 meters), N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente has spent many a cramped flight struggling for legroom and failing to sleep. He says he designed the Chaise Longue to solve the airplane seat conundrum \u2013 not make it worse. Still, the designer admits that for airlines, the appeal of the Chaise Longue is the increased passenger headcount. \u201cMany airlines and many big players of the industry are trying to push us to put more passengers into the aircraft,\u201c he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not our main priority and our main goal, but with this kind of design it\u2019s also possible.\u201d At this year\u2019s Aircraft Interiors Expo, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente\u2019s latest prototype will be tested out by a slew of airline bigwigs. He says he\u2019s always excited to get feedback from the industry, but is also keen for other would-be travelers to give their two cents. When the Chaise Longue hit the headlines in 2022, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente says he received multiple requests from people looking to travel to his home city of Madrid, Spain, to test the prototype themselves. \u201cWe have had people coming to try it, famous people that saw the article, and they were like, \u2018I want to go and try it,\u2019\u201d says N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente. Now N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente\u2019s launched the Chaise Longue in the Metaverse, thanks to a collaboration with a company called 3DSeatMap VR, to illustrate what the seat would look like in situ in a cabin. Virtual users can wander around the design and inspect it for themselves. But N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente is also still open to anyone \u2013 famous or otherwise \u2013 reaching out to experience the Chaise Longue prototype in person and to offer an honest take. \u201cWe do try to adapt to every single constructive feedback that we get,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how we move forward.\u201d Testing it out At AIX 2023, CNN Travel was the first to test out the newest Chaise Longue prototype. My first impression is that it\u2019s a little more \u201creal\u201d than last year\u2019s proof of concept. There are four rows \u2013 two top level, two bottom level \u2013 and the upcycled airplane seats from 1995 (\u201cthey\u2019re older than me,\u201d says N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente) actually recline, making it easier to visualize how this structure could work on an actual aircraft. The new design keeps the same basic double-level concept, with a few minor changes. The precarious ladder-like steps that previously got you up to the top level have been switched out for a sturdier version. Luggage on the bottom level is now designed to go under the seat in front of you. Rather than built-in screens, the idea is passengers could use personal devices for inflight entertainment. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente says he\u2019s also improved leg room on the top level, and I find it is pretty spacious. Plus, because there\u2019s no one directly behind you on the same level, you can recline the seat pretty far back, which is a definite plus. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente has also added a beam above the top level seats, to indicate ceiling height. I\u2019m 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 meters) and for me it feels like decent space \u2013 although it\u2019s still tricky to know what it would actually feel like to be closer to the cabin ceiling than the floor. As for the bottom level, to me \u2013 someone who is not a fan of small spaces \u2013 it feels pretty claustrophobic, but this will be a matter of personal opinion. While having a row of seats directly in your eyeline won\u2019t be appealing to everyone, others won\u2019t be as bothered \u2013 particularly when there\u2019s so much more space to stretch out your feet than in your average economy airplane seat. Like last year, I conclude that for some travelers just to sleep for the duration of a flight, this could be an effective solution. And while three people sitting on both the bottom and top rows feels a little tight, the fighting for elbow space is exactly the same in regular economy class. The seats on the lower level fold up when not in use \u2013 theater seat style \u2013 which N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente said makes the lower row of the design a little more accessible and could accommodate wheelchair users, although the top seat remains off limits for anyone with mobility issues. Future of travel N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente has spent the last year traveling the world, attending aviation fairs and meeting with industry experts to talk about his vision. His parents are often by his side supporting him \u2013 his father helped him transport the weighty Chaise Longue prototype across Europe by van from Spain to Germany for AIX. \u201cMy father has his own problems and businesses but he traveled 2,200 kilometers with me,\u201d says N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente. And N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente\u2019s partner, Clara Service Soto, works on the Chaise Longue full time too, acting as the project\u2019s Chief Operating Officer. The couple\u2019s friends didn\u2019t get it at first (\u201cYou guys are crazy, this won\u2019t happen. what are you doing, you\u2019re wasting your time, you\u2019re not getting a salary, you\u2019re wasting the best years of your life,\u201d N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente recalls them saying). But he says \u201cthere\u2019s been a shift of mindset\u201d as the project has grown and garnered momentum. And for N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente and Service Soto, sacrificing their social life is worth it for the wild ride they\u2019re enjoying in return. \u201cWe\u2019re getting to travel a lot and experience a lot of different cultures,\u201d says N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente. \u201cIt\u2019s also enriching, it\u2019s not only about the project, it\u2019s also about the journey behind it.\u201d While N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente says airlines are interested in the idea, there\u2019s no guarantee the Chaise Longue will come to fruition. And if it does, it won\u2019t be for some time \u2013 N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente is currently working on appropriate certifications \u2013 a process that will be lengthy and complex. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente is also acutely aware airlines generally aren\u2019t interested in investing in economy class. There are exceptions \u2013 like Air New Zealand\u2019s new economy SkyNest \u2013 but usually business and first class are where the innovation happens. Still, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente thinks the double-level structure could ultimately be adapted to any airplane cabin class. He\u2019s just released renderings of a premium economy version of the Chaise Longue \u2013 more or less the same concept, just without the lower middle seat. \u201cAt the end of the day, by having a double decker, you optimize the space, you take advantage of the space that otherwise is just air,\u201d he says. And while the road might be long, and the design may not appeal to all, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente still steadfastly believes in its viability. \u201cWe know that this will work at some point and people will be grateful for it even though they don\u2019t know it now, they will be grateful that someone was pushing for a new economy class seat,\u201d he says.",

            "text": "The pilot of the unresponsive private jet that triggered an interception by supersonic military fighter jets protecting Washington, DC, was observed slumped over in his seat, a source familiar with the response told CNN. The lone pilot and three passengers were aboard the Cessna Citation that crashed in a heavily wooded area near Waynesboro, Virginia, the Federal Aviation Administration said Monday. There were no survivors, authorities said. Another source told CNN that crash investigators are most interested in hypoxia \u2013 a shortage of oxygen in the blood \u2013 as a reason why the pilot and passengers didn\u2019t respond to attempts by air traffic controllers and even other civilian aircraft to contact the ill-fated plane.   Hypoxia is an insidious risk of flying at high altitude and could have been brought on by a decompression of the jet\u2019s pressurized cabin, aviation experts say. The flight was cruising from East Tennessee to Long Island, New York, at 34,000 feet, an altitude where pilots have 30 to 60 seconds to don oxygen masks when pressure drops or risk falling unconscious. When F-16s reached the Cessna 560 Citation V around 3:20 p.m., the jet pilots set off flares in an effort to get the pilot\u2019s attention, a Sunday news release from the Continental US North American Aerospace Defense Command Region said.   \u201cThe pilot was unresponsive and the Cessna subsequently crashed near the George Washington National Forest, Virginia,\u201d the release said. \u201cNORAD attempted to establish contact with the pilot until the aircraft crashed.\u201d  The FAA lost contact with the jet just 15 minutes after it took off, according to a statement from the agency and data from air travel tracking website FlightAware. Approximately eight minutes after losing contact, the agency contacted the \u201cDomestic Events Network\u201d that consists of the military, national security, homeland security and other law enforcement agencies, according to the FAA statement. The civilian aircraft flew from Elizabethton, Tennessee, past its destination \u2013 New York\u2019s Long Island MacArthur Airport \u2013 and turned back before eventually crashing in Virginia on Sunday afternoon, according to NORAD and LiveATC.net. In addition to the F-16s, air traffic controllers and other civilian pilots frantically tried to contact the unresponsive crew of the jet by radio as it flew toward Washington, DC, at 34,000 feet, audio from LiveATC.net revealed.  Key to investigators, a source familiar with the investigation says, is the function of the plane\u2019s autopilot. The flight turned around and kept flying for more than 300 miles before crashing in rural Virginia. First responders reached the crash site around 8 p.m. Sunday night, state police spokesperson Corinne Geller confirmed. Augusta County Sheriff Donald Smith said Monday that \u201cextremely steep\u201d and rough terrain made it difficult to get to the site, which was at the top of a mountain about 1.5 miles from a road.  Near the rugged scene Monday, National Transportation Safety Board investigator in charge Adam Gerhardt told reporters the agency\u2019s probe will ask: \u201cWhen exactly did the pilot become unresponsive? And why did the airplane fly the flight track that it did fly?\u201d Report: Plane\u2019s passengers were a woman, her toddler and nanny  John Rumpel, whose family company owned the wrecked aircraft, told the Washington Post that his daughter Adina Azarian, and 2-year-old granddaughter, Aria Azarian, were among the three passengers and pilot that died in the crash.  Rumpel also identified the pilot as Jeff Hefner, according to the report. The private aircraft was registered to Encore Motors of Melbourne, Inc., a company based in Florida, according to FAA records.   John Rumpel, whose wife Barbara is listed as the president of the company, told CNN Sunday night they own Encore. The husband confirmed Barbara Rumpel is safe but declined to comment further. John Rumpel told the Post that he received a call from the FAA about 90 minutes after dropping his daughter, granddaughter and their nanny at a Tennessee airport, where they were headed home to East Hampton, N.Y. The FAA asked Rumpel if he knew how to contact the plane, the Post reports. \u201cMy family is gone, my daughter and granddaughter,\u201d Barbara Rumpel wrote in response to a post on her Facebook profile in which others were asking if she was on the plane. Adina Azarian\u2019s employer, Keller Williams, remembered her in a statement as \u201ca very devoted mother\u201d and exceptional colleague. \u201cHer vibrant personality and unwavering commitment to her clients set her apart in the real estate industry. Adina\u2019s passion for her work and her genuine care for others touched the lives of many, making her an invaluable asset to our team at Keller Williams Points North,\u201d the company\u2019s New York City branch said. Hefner\u2019s previous employer, the head of a law firm where Hefner worked as a flight captain, said the pilot is survived by his wife and three children.  Hefner was \u201ca highly accomplished and skilled Aviator, he flew 25 years with as a Captain with Southwest Airlines and had over 25,000 flight hours,\u201d attorney Dan Newlin told CNN in a statement. He added, \u201cAfter retiring from Southwest Airlines, Jeff went on to be certified as a Captain in numerous private aircraft.\u201d  Investigators sift through wreckage The Cessna left a \u201ccrater\u201d in the ground and few clues as to why it went down, officials said Monday. Four first responders, who spoke on the condition they were not identified, described a grisly scene at the crash site.  There were perhaps four recognizable pieces of wreckage from the plane, which they believe impacted the ground at a very steep angle, they said. \u201cThere was nothing really bigger than your arm,\u201d said one. They also found signs of human remains.  NTSB officials will spend the next few days processing evidence at the crash site, before the wreckage is helicoptered to a secure facility in Delaware,  Gerhardt told reporters Monday. The plane was not required to carry \u201cblack boxes,\u201d devices used to record flight data, but investigators will still search for them in hopes that they were installed. Gerhardt said at this very early stage in the investigation, \u201cbasically everything is on the table,\u201d when it comes to determining the cause. Plane flew over US capital area It\u2019s unclear whether the private aircraft entered restricted airspace.  The US Capitol complex was placed on an \u201celevated alert\u201d when the plane flew near the area on Sunday afternoon, US Capitol Police said in a statement.  Six F-16s launched from three bases, White House National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby said Monday. Two jets from Joint Base Andrews were first to intercept the private plane, he said.  The F-16 jets were \u201cauthorized to travel at supersonic speeds\u201d as they raced to make contact with the aircraft, according to the Continental US North American Aerospace Defense Command Region news release.  The extraordinary speed caused a sonic boom across the Washington, DC, area, officials said. That means the jets were traveling faster than the speed of sound, creating shock waves that caused a sudden and resounding boom, startling some residents on the ground.  President Joe Biden was golfing at the Andrews Air Force Base golf course near Maryland\u2019s Joint Base Andrews when the boom resounded through Washington. The US Secret Service said it did not alter its posture for keeping President Biden secure after the fighter jets were scrambled. The president was briefed on the incident, according to a White House official. ",

            "text": "Global airlines should make nearly $10 billion in profit this year as business bounces back from the pandemic, according to a new forecast from the International Air Transport Association (IATA). IATA on Monday more than doubled its 2023 profit forecast for the global airline industry despite a looming economic downturn. Airlines are expected to make $9.8 billion in net profit in 2023, up from a December forecast of $4.7 billion. Stronger profitability was supported by cargo revenues, China\u2019s reopening and lower jet fuel prices, IATA\u2019s director general Willie Walsh said in a statement. The industry\u2019s main lobby group expects 4.35 billion people to travel by air this year, not far off the 4.54 billion passengers who flew in 2019.  The figures mark a significant turnaround for the airline industry, which carried just 1.8 billion passengers in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, at a loss of $76 per traveler. All told, the aviation industry suffered net losses of $183 billion between 2020 and 2022 as lockdowns hit travel.   From that nadir, air travel has rebounded even as high inflation and rising interest rates weigh on spending by businesses and consumers in other areas. \u201cDespite economic uncertainties, people are flying to reconnect, explore, and do business,\u201d Walsh said during a speech at IATA\u2019s annual meeting in Istanbul. \u201cAirports are busier, hotel occupancy is rising, local economies are reviving, and the airline industry has moved into profitability.\u201d Notwithstanding the sunnier outlook, profit margins remain \u201cwafer thin,\u201d Walsh added. \u201cRepairing damaged balance sheets and providing investors with sustainable returns on their capital will continue to be a challenge for many airlines,\u201d he added. Walsh pointed out that airlines would make $9.8 billion in profit off $803 billion of revenue \u2014 in other words, netting just $2.25 per passenger.  Still, that\u2019s cause for celebration, following years of \u201ceyewatering\u201d losses, he told CNN\u2019s Richard Quest.  \u201cThe fact that the industry could survive that demonstrates the resilience and determination and the actions that have been taken\u201d Walsh said, adding \u201cwe\u2019re fully acknowledging challenges but we\u2019re still quietly confident about the future.\u201d  In a separate interview with CNN, United Airlines\n            \n                (UAL) CEO Scott Kirby said he expected the carrier to return to 2019 levels of profitability this year. The airline was holding a lot more cash on its balance sheet, however, to withstand a potential economic downturn in the near term. \u201cWe\u2019ve dramatically improved our relative and absolute profit margins and we\u2019re starting to pay down debt and that gives us the firepower to really ride through a short term recession,\u201d Kirby added. \u2014 Gayle Harrington contributed reporting.",

            "text": "The CEO of Qatar Airways has described the airline industry\u2019s emissions goals as a \u201cPR exercise,\u201d saying aviation is on track to miss its target to achieve net zero status in 2050.  Akbar Al Baker was speaking to CNN at the annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), on the day the group announced a roadmap to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. \u201cLet us not fool ourselves,\u201d Al Baker told CNN\u2019s Richard Quest. \u201cWe will not even reach the targets we have for 2030, I assure you. Because there is not enough raw material to get the volumes of SAF [sustainable aviation fuel].\u201d  IATA has pledged to boost the use of SAF by 2030, with a goal of becoming net zero in 2050.  However, Al Baker insists the industry\u2019s targets are unrealistic, given the current volumes of SAF being produced, and says the airline industry is in denial about the rate of progress.   \u201cWhat we are trying to do is for a PR exercise saying that it will happen, and it will be done, it will be achieved \u2013 but it won\u2019t be able to be achieved,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cAnd the governments will use this to line their pockets by putting [on] levies.\u201d Earlier on Monday, IATA Director-General Willie Walsh unveiled a series of steps roadmaps for the industry to achieve the net zero target, saying they showed \u201ca clear direction\u201d for the industry\u2019s efforts to decarbonize. Currently, SAF production is less than 0.1% of what is needed for aviation to achieve net zero. But Walsh said the trend is positive, pointing to a tripling of production to 300 million liters (9 million gallons) last year. That would need to rise to 450 billion liters (117 billion gallons) in 2050.   \u201cWe\u2019re openly acknowledging that this is going to be a huge challenge,\u201d Walsh told Quest as the IATA meeting began on Sunday. \u201cI think it would be wrong for us to try and convince people that this is going to be easy, and it\u2019s going to be cheap \u2014 it\u2019s not.\u201d \u201cBut the idea that we can\u2019t do it \u2014 no, I don\u2019t accept that.\u201d Al Baker is one of the longest-serving and most influential executives in the airline industry, and previously served as IATA\u2019s chair. Despite his skepticism on the industry\u2019s current emissions targets, he still believes that net zero is achievable. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t be done, but to do it in the [2050] time frame, the industry is far behind.\u201d",

            "text": "It\u2019s a growing problem that has United States naval commanders scratching their heads: How to keep up with China\u2019s ever-expanding fleet of warships. Not only is China\u2019s navy already the world\u2019s largest, its numerical lead over the US is getting wider, with the head of the US Navy warning recently that American shipyards simply can\u2019t keep up. Some experts estimate China can build three warships in the time it takes the US to build one. It is just one of the concerns, alongside Beijing\u2019s increasing aggression in the South China Sea and around Taiwan, that\u2019s likely to be weighing on the mind of US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as he joins top military figures from across the region at this weekend\u2019s Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. The chance of a breakthrough on any of those issues this weekend appears slim, not least because China has pointedly rejected a US proposal for Austin to meet his Chinese counterpart Li Shangfu at the forum.  But experts who spoke to CNN before the summit say a potential solution to one of them \u2013 the Chinese fleet\u2019s numerical advantage \u2013 is within reach, if the US is prepared to think outside the box. Washington, they say, has something Beijing doesn\u2019t: Allies in South Korea and Japan who are building some of the highest spec \u2013 and affordable \u2013 naval hardware on the oceans.  Buying ships from these countries, or even building US-designed vessels in their shipyards, could be a cost-effective way of closing the gap with China, they say.  Their warships are \u201ccertainly a match for their (Chinese) counterparts,\u201d says Blake Herzinger, a research fellow at the United States Studies Center in Australia, while Japan\u2019s warship designers \u201care among the world\u2019s best,\u201d says Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center in Hawaii. Both countries have mutual defense treaties with the US, so why doesn\u2019t the US team up with them to outbuild China? The problem is, US law currently prevents its Navy from buying foreign-built ships \u2013 even from allies \u2013 or from building its own ships in foreign countries due to both security concerns and a desire to protect America\u2019s shipbuilding industry. Schuster, Herzinger and others are among a growing body of experts who say it may be time to rethink that law to give the US an edge in the battle for the seas. A challenger for China\u2019s world-beating Type 055s  The Pentagon estimates China\u2019s navy to have around 340 warships at present, while the US has fewer than 300. It thinks the Chinese fleet will grow to 400 in the next two years, while the US fleet will take until 2045 to hit 350. But it\u2019s not just the increasing vastness of the Chinese navy that has raised concerns. Some of the ships China is churning out arguably have greater firepower than some of their US counterparts. Take China\u2019s Type 055, in many eyes the world\u2019s premier destroyer.  Displacing 12,000 to 13,000 tons, the Type 055 is bigger than typical destroyers (it is nearer in size to the US Navy\u2019s Ticonderoga class of cruisers) and packs a formidable punch. It has 112 vertical launch system (VLS) cells that fire surface-to-air and anti-ship missiles, which is more than the 96 on the newest of the US Navy\u2019s Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. It also boasts sophisticated radio and anti-submarine weapons systems. And China is pumping them out. It began building the Type 055s in 2014 and recently commissioned its eighth, the Xianyang. The US\u2019s work on its Zumwalt-class destroyers has been much slower; construction began five years earlier, yet only two have entered service.  But some Western analysts say the Type 055 may have a peer in South Korea\u2019s Sejong the Great-class destroyers. At 10,000 to 12,000 tons displacement, the Sejongs are slightly smaller than China\u2019s Type 055s, but they have more firepower, with 128 VLS cells and weapons that include surface-to-air, anti-submarine and cruise missiles. The three Sejongs, which cost about $925 million each, are the pride of the South Korean fleet. \u201cWith this one ship, (the South Korean Navy) can cope with multiple simultaneous situations \u2013 anti-aircraft, anti-ship, anti-submarine, anti-surface \u2013 and defend from ballistic missiles,\u201d the country\u2019s Defense Media Agency says. Retired South Korean Adm. Duk-ki Kim, the first person to captain a Sejong, says it\u2019s more than a match for China\u2019s Type 055.  \u201cChina is focusing on quantity and price competitiveness rather than the quality of its vessels,\u201d Kim, now vice president of the Korea Association of Military Studies, told CNN. High-spec, low cost  Japan, too, has \u201cworld class\u201d destroyers, said Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy at King\u2019s College in London. The country\u2019s newest Maya-class destroyers are armed with 96 VLS cells that can fire both anti-ballistic and anti-submarine missiles, while the \u201cquality of its sensors and systems stands at the very top end of the spectrum,\u201d according to Patalano. Last November, the Mayas demonstrated their ability to destroy ballistic missiles traveling outside Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Those 96 VLS cells put the Mayas on par with the newest of the US Arleigh Burkes, but there\u2019s a crucial difference between them: The Arleigh Burkes cost $2.2 billion; the Mayas cost a billion dollars less. In other words, the Mayas represent both \u201cquantity and quality\u201d: They are high-spec, (relatively) low cost and can roll off production lines at speed. \u201cIf Chinese shipbuilding is showing a remarkable capacity for mass production, Japan\u2019s is leading the way in affordable quality on a scale larger than most naval powers, without sacrificing commissioning times. That balance, and the experience in the philosophy, are a genuine edge,\u201d Patalano said. And it\u2019s not just the Mayas. Take Japan\u2019s Mogami-class frigates; speedy, stealthy 5,500-ton warships with 16 VLS cells that fire surface-to-air and anti-ship missiles. All done with a crew of 90 and a price tag of about $372 million each. By contrast, the first of the US Navy\u2019s under development Constellation-class frigates are expected to cost three times as much and require twice as many crew. That\u2019s less than ideal given the US Navy is having a hard time recruiting \u2013 the US vice chief of naval operations has said it is likely to miss its recruiting goal by 6,000 this year \u2013 though the Constellations are expected to have twice as many VLS cells as the Mogamis. Cost comparisons with China\u2019s Type 055s are harder due to the opacity of the Chinese system; estimates of their costs range anywhere from $925 million to $2.6 billion each.   An Asian secret weapon So what\u2019s making South Korean and Japanese shipyards so competitive?   Cost overruns, endemic in US defense contracting, are not common in Japan, Schuster says, because \u2013 unlike the US \u2013 the country holds manufacturers to their estimates. \u201cA Japanese shipbuilder\u2019s bid is an absolute. If they finish it below expected cost, they make a larger profit. If they encounter delays and mistakes, the builder has to correct it at their own expense,\u201d Schuster said. That approach was \u201cmuch wiser\u201d than that of the US, he claims, pointing to the alleged problems with Zumwalt-class destroyers and littoral combat ships that have seen the Pentagon spend billions on platforms that critics say the US Navy doesn\u2019t know what to do with. The US Navy\u2019s three Zumwalt destroyers have priced out at about $8 billion each, but it\u2019s unclear how they fit into the rest of the fleet.  Meanwhile, some of the US\u2019s littoral combat ships, which cost more than $350 million each, are expected to be decommissioned before they have even served a third of their life span. Time for a rethink?  All these Japanese and South Korean vessels are designed to incorporate US technology, weapons, spy radars and the Aegis command and control system. Partly this is so that the two navies can operate seamlessly alongside their US counterpart, as they did in joint exercises earlier this year.  But then if the US, Japanese and South Korean ships use similar technology and can operate together, why does the law prevent the US from building some of its ships in Japanese and South Korean shipyards? The prohibition isn\u2019t just about security concerns. It\u2019s also aimed at keeping shipbuilding jobs and expertise within the US.  In 2019, total economic activity associated with the US shipbuilding industry accounted for nearly 400,000 jobs and contributed $42.4 billion in GDP, according to the Maritime Administration, with 154 shipyards spread across 29 states classified as active shipbuilders and more than 300 engaged in ship repairs or capable of building ships. The US military is an important source of demand for these shipbuilders; while less than 3% of the vessels delivered in 2020 went to US government agencies, 14 of the 15 large deep-draft vessels went to a combination of the US Navy and the US Coast Guard.  Tough call to make  Any move that might be perceived as threatening such an important industry would therefore be politically fraught. Shipbuilding representatives argue more needs to be spent on the domestic industry, rather than less, recently telling Congress the single biggest issue facing shipyards was attracting and retaining a quality workforce, according to USNI News. US Navy spokesperson Travis Callaghan said, \u201cThe Navy currently has a significant number of ships under construction and on contract across several shipyards. We have also made and continue to make significant investments in our shipyards to increase and maximize capacity. The Navy is committed to providing a ready, modernized, and capable naval force that continues to be the nation\u2019s primary instrument of sea control both now and into the future.\u201d There are also those analysts who, while admiring the shipbuilding prowess of Japan and South Korea, say getting them to build ships for the US would be a step too far. Speaking on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval studies at the IISS, said US cooperation with its allies is already shifting the trajectory of naval power in Asia away from China. There\u2019s \u201ca new phase of maritime balance\u201d in the region that has it slowly edging back in Washington\u2019s favor, Childs said. However, he doesn\u2019t think the answer is building US ships overseas. \u201cI think the answer is to learn from the way they do it rather than get them to do it for you,\u201d he said. Still, proponents of outsourcing say employing the help of allies offers a more immediate fix \u2013 and point out the US already outsources designs overseas; its Constellation-class frigates are based on an Italian design and Japan has been mooted as a possible source for future blueprints. But Schuster thinks designs aren\u2019t enough \u2013 the US needs more ships now, he says.  \u201cSince shipyard availability is at a premium in the United States, having a portion of that work done in Japan would address that problem until America can refurbish and expand its shipyards \u2013 a 10-year process in most defense analysts\u2019 eyes,\u201d Schuster said.  Retired South Korean admiral Kim thinks partnering on shipbuilding offers everyone \u201ca win-win.\u201d Herzinger, too, thinks it\u2019s time to rethink the law. Japan and South Korea \u201cboth build very high quality ships on time and on budget, both things (the US has) lost the ability to do,\u201d Herzinger said. ",

Beijing calls the aircraft its first large homegrown passenger jet. It\u2019s a prominent symbol of Beijing\u2019s broader \u201cMade in China\u201d strategy, a campaign to reduce national reliance on foreign manufacturers.  But instead of boosting China\u2019s global stature in technology innovation, experts say the C919 is a symbol of its continued reliance on the West. That\u2019s because a large chunk of the plane\u2019s parts come from foreign suppliers, predominantly in North America and Europe. Chinese state media has said about 40% of the model\u2019s components are imported, though experts say the real proportion is much higher.  While it is normal for manufacturers to source equipment for their planes from around the world, \u201cthe C919 is unique in that almost nothing that keeps it in the air is from China,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, who spent two years leading a team that researched China\u2019s decades-long efforts to develop its own commercial aircraft. Their conclusion? \u201cThe C919 is primarily a non-Chinese airplane with Chinese paint on it,\u201d said Scott, trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington. A long-held dream The C919 was built by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), a state-owned enterprise based in Shanghai, with the stated goal of letting \u201cChina-made large aircraft fly in the blue sky.\u201d One cannot overstate how difficult that is, according to Shukor Yusof, founder of Endau Analytics, which tracks the aviation industry.  Currently, only a handful of countries in the world make their own planes \u2014 and for good reason, he said, citing extremely high obstacles, such as serious technical expertise, rigorous regulatory requirements and eye-popping amounts of time and resources.  The C919, for instance, has already cost an estimated $49 billion, according to CSIS, though it says pinning down precisely how much is an almost impossible task because COMAC\u2019s finances are opaque. While it\u2019s not COMAC\u2019s first homegrown plane, more attention has been directed to this model because of its size. The C919 can seat up to 192 passengers and fly up to 5,550 kilometers (about 3,500 miles).  COMAC\u2019s first commercial plane, by comparison, is a much smaller regional jet called the ARJ21, which can only fly up to 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) and accommodate up to 97 passengers.  COMAC is also working on a long-range, widebody plane called the CR929. But the project, a joint effort by China and Russia, has likely stalled since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, said Kennedy. \u201cThat plane will probably never be more than a photo, never be more than a drawing,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cNo one is going to be supplying technology to a Chinese-Russian joint venture.\u201d Made in China? The C919\u2019s maiden commercial flight took place Sunday, flying passengers from Shanghai to Beijing for China Eastern Airlines\n            \n                (CEA). China hopes the C919 will become its alternative to Boeing\u2019s 737 and Airbus\u2019s A320 and cement its status as a high-tech superpower, says Kennedy. But because the government has touted the aircraft as a homemade success, analysts have been quick to point out just how much is made outside China. In a 2020 analysis, CSIS estimated that approximately 90% of the C919\u2019s main or large-scale component suppliers were from North America and Europe, with only 10% coming from China and other countries in Asia. Yusof cited a similar estimate. Kennedy said while it was possible the proportion had changed since the 2020 report, he thought it was unlikely given how tough it would be to change suppliers during the aviation certification process.  The C919 got the green light for commercial service and mass production in mainland China late last year, after years of delays. China has acknowledged the criticism. \u201cSome people have been questioning whether the C919 can be called a domestically-manufactured aircraft when it relies on imports,\u201d Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times said in an editorial Monday.  \u201cIt is true that there is a long list of foreign suppliers for the C919.\u201d The aircraft contains \u201cHoneywell\u2019s\n            \n                (HON) electricity system and landing gear, GE\u2019s\n            \n                (GE) flight recorder, CFM Leap\u2019s engine, Parker Aerospace\u2019s flight control system and fuel system, Rockwell Collins\u2019 weather radar and simulate system, and Michelin\u2019s\n            \n                (MGDDY) tires,\u201d the outlet noted. All are US or European companies. The government\u2019s position is that other manufacturers often rely on imports, too. Boeing and Airbus also depend on \u201chigh-quality global suppliers,\u201d state-run newspaper China Daily said in an editorial Wednesday. America\u2019s Boeing\n            \n                (BA) sources about 40% to 50% of components for planes such as its 787 Dreamliner from outside the United States, according to Yusof. Airbus\n            \n                (EADSF), a European plane maker, also sources from countries such as Malaysia, he said. Taking on titans China has made no secret of its ambition for COMAC to eventually compete against Airbus and Boeing, which currently command virtually the entire market. Yusof said this was unlikely to happen anytime soon. For one, COMAC hasn\u2019t distinguished its planes enough to convince carriers to make the switch. Its technology is \u201calready available in the Airbus and in the Boeing planes,\u201d he said. It could also take many years for its planes to be certified by US and European aviation regulators.  But once production ramps up, it\u2019s expected to win more orders at home, or in developing countries where carriers may not be able to afford the current market leaders\u2019 prices. In Indonesia, domestic airline TransNusa became COMAC\u2019s first overseas customer last year. \u201cIt should be greatly appreciated that another country apart from the Europeans and the Americans are providing an alternative aircraft in the commercial market,\u201d said Yusof. But even if China were to price its planes more aggressively, it will take a long time to win people over, he added. \u201cAirlines in the world will not be easily persuaded to buy one, because there\u2019s always a stigma [with new players] whether you like it or not,\u201d Yusof said.",

The blue-chip index soared 734 points, or 2.2%, putting it on track for the best daily gain since November 2022. The S&P 500 gained 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2%. All three major indexes are on pace to gain for the week, with the Dow and S&P 500 headed for their best weeks since March. The Nasdaq is on track to notch its sixth consecutive week up. The stock market\u2019s gains come after the Senate passed the debt ceiling deal in a Thursday evening vote, leaving investors anticipating an end to weeks of concern that the United States could default on its debt for the first time. A mixed May jobs report also helped boost stocks. While the headline jobs number of 339,000 showed that the US labor market is still extremely robust, the report also revealed a slight cooldown in average hourly wages and an increase in the unemployment rate. \u201cMoving past the debt ceiling and receiving somewhat of a goldilocks employment report \u2014 solid jobs with slowing wage growth and a higher unemployment report \u2014 has provided a one-two punch that has boosted confidence of investors who were sidelined and allayed some near-term recession concerns,\u201d wrote Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services. Futures traders are pricing in an interest rate pause at the Fed\u2019s next meeting on June 13-14, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. But markets still see a 29% chance that the central bank hikes rates by a quarter point after contrasting signs about the labor market\u2019s health in the jobs report, and some investors remain divided on whether the central bank will hike in July, or pause. \u201cThe May jobs report is a particularly difficult one for the Fed to parse,\u201d Bank of America economists wrote in a Friday note. \u201cWe think the May jobs report is just soft enough to justify a hold.\u201d",

            "text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has wrapped up his first trip to China in three years, after meeting a string of government officials and thanking workers at the company\u2019s mega factory in Shanghai. Musk\u2019s private jet took off from Shanghai\u2019s Hongqiao airport on Thursday, capping a whirlwind 48-hour trip by the billionaire, according to Variflight, a Chinese flight data app.  It was the first time Musk has visited the country since January 2020, when a video of him dancing onstage at Tesla\u2019s Shanghai factory went viral. Before leaving, Musk met Chen Jining, the Communist Party chief of Shanghai, according to a statement by the city government.  Chen encouraged Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) to boost its investment and operations in Shanghai and \u201cbring more new products, new technologies and new services\u201d to the city.  Musk praised the success of Tesla\u2019s Shanghai facility \u2014 which opened in 2019 \u2014 and said he was hoping to work more with the city in various areas, the statement said. He visited the Gigafactory late Wednesday, after arriving from Beijing. (Variflight showed his jet arrived in Shanghai at 9:26 pm on Wednesday.) \u201cThank you for being here late at night,\u201d he said in a speech in front of a massive crowd of workers, according to a video released on social media by Tesla China. \u201cI would very much like to congratulate you on the amazing work that you have done,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIt\u2019s been incredibly impressive how you have been able to overcome so many difficulties and so many challenges.\u201d \u201cI just want to let you know, it warms my heart,\u201d Musk said, making a fist pump after tapping his chest. His words were met with applause and cheers. Musk then made a \u201cheart\u201d sign with his hands, saying: \u201cI tell people throughout the world, the cars we produce here are not just the most efficient production, but also the highest quality.\u201d  The Shanghai Gigafactory is Tesla\u2019s biggest car manufacturing plant outside the United States. In 2022, the company delivered 1.31 million vehicles globally, more than half of which were from Shanghai, according to its financial results.  In May 2022, Musk touted the work ethic of Chinese employees, praising them burning \u201cthe 3 a.m. oil\u201d in an interview with the Financial Times. At the time, Shanghai was in the midst of a two-month Covid lockdown. Just six months later, in November, the Shanghai factory set a fresh monthly delivery record of more than 100,000 vehicles. All this was achieved after Covid restrictions caused the plant to temporarily suspend production. Many meetings Musk arrived in Beijing on Tuesday, starting his trip by meeting the country\u2019s foreign minister Qin Gang, according to a statement by the ministry. He then met with the country\u2019s tech and commerce ministers separately, discussing matters related to electric vehicles, connected cars, US-China relations and Tesla\u2019s development in China, according to government releases. The owner of Twitter, which is blocked in China, didn\u2019t send any tweets during the trip. But he published posts on both Twitter and on Weibo, China\u2019s equivalent, shortly after the visit. \u201cCongratulations to Giga Shanghai & Tesla China SDS teams for their excellent work overcoming many obstacles over many years!! \u201d Musk said separately on his Twitter and Weibo accounts on Friday. He also reportedly met with Zeng Yuqun, chairman and founder of CATL, a Chinese EV battery manufacturer and a Tesla supplier, according to an image published by the Paper.cn and widely circulated on social media. Tesla didn\u2019t immediately reply to a CNN request for comment.",

            "text": "More lengthy delays could be in store for Boeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft, which is designed to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station and compete with SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon. Boeing had been working toward a late July launch of the first crewed Starliner test flight. But \u201cwe did have two new issues that cropped up as part of our review process,\u201d said Mark Nappi, Boeing\u2019s vice president and program manager for the CST-100 Starliner, during a Thursday news briefing. \u201cSo, we spent the last week really looking at those in more detail.\u201d Ultimately, after consulting with Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun and NASA, the company\u00a0decided to stand down from its July launch attempt to work through the problems. One issue relates to the parachutes and a mechanism called a \u201csoft link,\u201d which had a lower threshold for failure than initially expected. The other relates to tape that is used to protect wire harnesses from scuffing, Nappi said. That tape was found to be flammable. This is only the latest in a long string of delays for the Starliner program, which had been expected to begin flying astronauts years ago. \u201cEverybody is a bit disappointed,\u201d Steve Stich, NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program manager, said Thursday. \u201cBut you can see people ready to roll up their sleeves and figure out what the next steps are and this team will solve these problems.\u201d Despite a long history of delays, technology hang-ups and development issues, Boeing has repeatedly expressed its commitment to the Starliner program. On Thursday, officials reiterated that they are not backing out of their commitment to the program. Boeing will also continue to bear the cost of the delays for the program. The company previousy reported that it has incurred cost overruns to the tune of nearly $900 million. Nappi said that the problems discussed Thursday are \u201ctoo new\u201d to determine additional expenses. A launch this year could still be feasible, but officials said they will not commit to a new launch date until they better understand the new issues. Years of delays In 2022, Starliner was sent on a second uncrewed test flight to orbit. Problems with Starliner have cropped up during virtually every stage of its development program. The issues that officials identified during that mission included hang-ups with a few of the spacecraft\u2019s thrusters that did not power on as intended and software problems. None of those issues had a major impact on the test mission, however, and the vehicle was still able to complete its multiday journey to the space station and return safely back to Earth. Officials did, however, deem those problems serious enough to require fixes before allowing crew on board the vehicle. Notably, the first attempt to send the Starliner on\u00a0an uncrewed orbital test run in late 2019\u00a0had to be cut short \u2014 taking the vehicle directly back to land rather than to an ISS docking \u2014 after software issues sent the vehicle off course. It took nearly two years of troubleshooting before the Starliner was ready to return to the launchpad. Then, an issue with sticky valves further delayed the capsule\u2019s return to flight. While even the space agency initially expected that Boeing, a decades-long partner of NASA\u2019s, would beat SpaceX to the launchpad, Boeing is now likely at least three years behind its upstart rival. SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon launched its first astronaut mission in 2020 and has conducted routine flights with people on board since then. But NASA wants at least two spacecraft capable of getting astronauts to the ISS and back in the hopes that, should either vehicle encounter a problem that would keep it grounded, there\u2019s always a backup transport option. NASA astronauts Barry \u201cButch\u201d Wilmore and Sunita Williams have been assigned to be the first astronauts to fly aboard Starliner. Boeing officials said the crew has been informed of the additional delays. The space agency awarded Boeing a $4.2 billion contract in 2014 for Starliner\u2019s development\u00a0\u2014 nearly twice as much as the $2.6 billion that was given to SpaceX. Though Boeing has negotiated for some additional funds as it has experienced delays, the company has borne much of the burden of the cost overruns.",

Federal Judge Jorge Alonso, who will preside over the trial due to start in federal court in Chicago next month, said that Boeing\u2019s attorney had argued that under the law \u201cevidence of pre-impact fright and terror is not relevant,\u201d because \u201cthe evidence tends to show that the passengers had no time to experience conscious pain and suffering after injury because they died immediately upon impact.\u201d But Alonso rejected that argument and opened the way for pain and suffering to be considered when determining compensation for the victims\u2019 family members. \u201cA jury could reasonably infer from the evidence that will be presented at trial that the passengers on\u2026 [the flight] perceived that they were going to crash, horrifically, to their certain death,\u201d the judge wrote in his order late Tuesday. The flight was an Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed on March 10, 2019. It was the second such crash involving a 737 Max in less than six months and it led to a 20-month grounding of the jet worldwide, during which time investigators found a design flaw by Boeing was the major cause of the crashes. One of the attorneys for the Ethiopian Airlines crash victims praised the judge\u2019s ruling. \u201cThis is a significant and strong win for the families,\u201d said Robert Clifford. \u201cThe judge will allow them to push forward the claims of emotional distress experienced by their loved ones who needlessly died at the hands of a company that puts profits over safety and allowed the crash to occur that could have been completely avoided.\u201d  Clifford said the passengers on the plane \u201cundeniably suffered horrific emotional distress, pain and suffering\u201d because they knew they were about to die in a crash.  Boeing declined to comment on the judge\u2019s ruling, instead pointing to an earlier statement from the company about the court cases it faces.  \u201cWe are deeply sorry to all who lost loved ones on Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Flight 302,\u201d it said. \u201cWe acknowledged the terrible impact of these tragic accidents and made an upfront commitment to fully and fairly compensate every family who suffered a loss. Over the past several years we have kept our commitment as we settled a significant majority of claims and we will continue to work to constructively resolve the remaining cases.\u201d  The trial is due to get underway on June 20.",

Tammy Duckworth and Tammy Baldwin \u2013 would require the Federal Aviation Administration to conduct new airplane cabin evacuation tests with more realistic conditions, and issue standards that include the size of and space between seats. They\u2019re concerned about safe evacuation in an emergency. But the issue of seat size is near and dear to travelers frustrated with wedging into tight coach seats.     \u201cYou say \u2018Hey, do you think the FAA \u2013 when they conduct a test \u2013 should simulate the actual people that are in the aircraft?\u2019\u201d Duckworth said to reporters on a conference call. \u201cI think most Americans would say, \u2018Well, yeah, don\u2019t they already do that?\u2019\u201d  Her criticism refers to aircraft evacuation testing the FAA conducted in 2019. The mock cabins used 60 \u201cpassengers\u201d \u2013 far fewer than in most commercial jets \u2013 between the ages of 18 and 60 but did not include senior citizens, people with mobility disabilities or carry-on luggage.     \u201cObviously, the FAA simply chose to ignore the reality of flying in America today,\u201d Duckworth said.   The FAA declined to comment on the matter.   The tests and standard seat sizes were criticized by passenger and safety advocates. Flyers Rights, a non-profit organization, unsuccessfully pushed the FAA to regulate a minimum seat size, citing among other issues concerns about blood clotting due to tight quarters. Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants labor union, told Congress that \u201cflight attendants are left to manage the frustrations of passengers jammed into ever-shrinking space.\u201d And some say a modern, crowded cabin could not be fully evacuated within 90 seconds, the FAA\u2019s standard.    The FAA explained to CNN at the time that the 2019 tests were to \u201cfirst decide if it\u2019s a safety issue,\u201d and the findings concluded common seat sizes were not an obstacle to evacuation. \u201cBased on this study\u2019s results, currently flying seat pitches using seats of similar size or smaller than those used in this project can accommodate and not impede egress for 99% of the American population,\u201d the report said.    More than 26,000 comments poured in when the FAA asked the public last year whether it should regulate a minimum seat size in the name of evacuation and safety. The industry group representing major air carriers, Airlines for America, wrote that \u201cthere is no factual or data predicate that supports promulgating additional rules concerning aircraft seat dimensions.\u201d Alluding to the 2019 tests, it said the FAA had already \u201cconcluded that current aircraft seating configurations, seat size standards, and evacuation procedures are safe.\u201d    But Duckworth, who leads the Senate subcommittee regulating airlines, said she wants the FAA to take another look rather than wait for a \u201ctragedy to bring our aircraft evacuation standards up to date.\u201d The Illinois Democrat is reintroducing the legislation as her committee hashes out new directives for the FAA in a process called reauthorization.    \u201cThere\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t simulate these real-world conditions that we see every day on flights so we can have more realistic evacuation standards,\u201d Duckworth said. \u201cI mean, for crying out loud, put some put some carry-on baggage on the (test) aircraft.\u201d   ",

            "text": "The CEOs of some of America\u2019s biggest companies are in China this week to take the pulse of one of their top markets after the country reopened following nearly three years of pandemic restrictions.  Elon Musk of Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA), Laxman Narasimhan of Starbucks\n            \n                (SBUX) and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan\n            \n                (JPM) are among the big names in town. They follow a string of visits in recent months from the leaders of Apple\n            \n                (AAPL), Samsung\n            \n                (SSNLF), Aramco, Volkswagen\n            \n                (VLKAF), HSBC\n            \n                (HSBC), Standard Chartered\n            \n                (SCBFF) and Kering. The CEO parade in the world\u2019s second largest economy highlights the importance of China for many blue-chip firms. But what executives are finding as they touch down is a more complex business environment characterized by a crackdown on international consulting firms, geopolitical tension and an uncertain investment outlook. Until December, China was largely sealed off under stringent \u201czero-Covid\u201d restrictions, escalating calls in the international business community to reduce their reliance on the country. Those limits are gone, kicking off an economic recovery in the first quarter that now appears to be sputtering.  To drum up business, Chinese leaders have urged foreign companies to invest more in the country, promising them an open and level playing field.  That theme was apparent Tuesday, when Musk met with China\u2019s Foreign Minister Qin Gang, who called for \u201ca healthy\u201d relationship with the United States, saying it was \u201cin the interests of both countries and the world.\u201d Musk backed the view, saying Tesla was against the notion of \u201cdecoupling\u201d with China. \u201cThe interests of the United States and China are intertwined like conjoined twins,\u201d he was quoted as saying by the foreign ministry. Musk was later also quoted by China\u2019s commerce ministry as saying relations between the two countries were not a zero-sum game \u2014 where for one side to win, the other must lose.  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about Musk\u2019s visit, and the billionaire\u2019s Twitter account was unusually quiet following his arrival. Tesla has been playing defense in recent months, cutting prices after losing market share to competitors in China, such as Warren Buffett-backed BYD\n            \n                (BYDDF). Those reductions have kicked off a price war in China\u2019s electric vehicle sector, the world\u2019s biggest market for such cars. Calls for clarity For executives, the visits are a chance to reconnect with employees and rub shoulders with government officials for the first time in years. Dimon\u2019s visit to mainland China is his first in four years, according to a person close to the bank.  The Wall Street boss met with Shanghai\u2019s Communist Party chief Tuesday, where authorities say he was told the government hoped that JPMorgan would use \u201cits international influence\u201d to promote investment in China\u2019s financial hub. Dimon was later quoted in a Shanghai government statement as saying the bank would serve as \u201ca bridge\u201d for global companies to better understand and invest in the city. But dealing with China has \u201cbecome a far more complex situation,\u201d he acknowledged in a Bloomberg TV interview Wednesday. Over time, \u201cthere will be less trade\u201d between China and the United States, Dimon predicted. \u201cThis is not decoupling, this is de-risking.\u201d In recent years, Western companies have been under pressure to reduce the risk to their businesses by diversifying supply chains beyond China. That\u2019s been driven by a number of factors, including fears that Taiwan could be invaded by the country and ongoing tension between Beijing and Washington.  Apple, long the poster child for US investment in China, has been doing just that. The visits coincide with a crackdown on international consulting firms that has alarmed foreign businesses. This month, state security authorities said they had raided several offices of Capvision, an expert network with headquarters in Shanghai and New York. The announcement came after Chinese officials closed the Beijing office of Mintz Group, an American corporate due diligence firm, and questioned employees at the local branch of consultancy Bain. The investigations are part of wider efforts by Beijing to increase oversight into what is deemed sensitive information pertinent to national security. The campaign has had a chilling effect on US businesses in China, leading some to wonder \u201cwho\u2019s next?\u201d Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, previously told CNN. The British Chamber of Commerce in China has also said its members are feeling unsettled, calling on the Chinese government to clarify regulatory guidelines. A mixed bag The uncertainty has led some firms to hold back on committing more money to China. In a British Chamber survey last month, 70% of businesses said they were \u201cadopting a \u2018wait-and-see\u2019 approach\u201d on decisions to invest long term in the country.  \u201cMany companies and investors are sitting on the sidelines right now as they are still looking for more clarity around China\u2019s economic policy, including how China will manage its relationship with the US,\u201d said Ben Cavender, managing director of strategy consultancy China Market Research Group. Beijing and Washington have been working to stabilize relations, but tensions remain. This month, China banned US chipmaker Micron\n            \n                (MICR) from selling to key suppliers in the country, citing cybersecurity risks. The move was seen as retaliation for restrictions the United States has imposed on Chinese chipmakers. Nick Marro, global trade lead at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said business confidence was \u201calready relatively fragile\u201d from China\u2019s pandemic policies, which only ended recently. \u201cThe recent crackdowns on information providers has worsened a lot of this uncertainty,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cCompanies are increasingly unsure of where the government\u2019s \u2018red lines\u2019 are, and what steps they need to take to avoid falling foul of regulators.\u201d In some cases, though, businesses are boosting their investments. Last month, Tesla announced a second factory in Shanghai, dedicated to the production of large-scale batteries.  Volkswagen\n            \n                (VLKAF) also unveiled plans to pour $1 billion into a new development center for electric cars in China. The move came weeks before shareholders called for an independent audit of the German automaker\u2019s factory in Xinjiang, the western Chinese region that has been linked to allegations of forced labor. Marro said the decision to reinvest in China was unsurprising. \u201cWe\u2019ve long cautioned against expectations of a wide-scale \u2018exodus\u2019 of companies fleeing China, even as business sentiment has moderated in recent years,\u201d he added. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that the conversations around \u2018de-risking\u2019 or \u2018de-coupling\u2019 aren\u2019t happening, particularly at the government level. Instead, it shows how tricky these policy objectives are in practice.\u201d \u2014 CNN\u2019s Sophie Jeong and Martha Zhou contributed to this report.",

            "title": "Private jets get a bad rap. This company is trying to make them greener",
            "text": "Environmental groups have long criticized the private aviation sector for being a disproportionally large contributor to global carbon dioxide emissions, and last week, climate activists made headlines by disrupting a private jet trade fair in Switzerland. Because they often travel shorter distances than commercial jets, private jets are generally less efficient, and their emissions per passenger are much higher. According to data from European non-profit Transport and Environment, private jets can be five to 14 times more polluting than commercial planes, and 50 times more polluting than trains.  Yet the private aviation sector has seen considerable growth in recent years. A report by the Institute for Policy Studies revealed that it set industry records in 2021 and 2022, with the size of the global fleet growing by 133% since 2000. Research commissioned by Greenpeace showed that private jets in Europe alone emitted 3.39 million metric tons of CO2 in 2022, roughly equivalent to the emissions from 753,000 gasoline-powered cars in the US driven for a year.  But experts say the sector can still play a crucial role in the global fight against climate change, and some in the industry are looking at innovative ways to reduce its environmental impact. As a member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), along with other major commercial airlines, Dubai-based private aviation company Jetex is aiming to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.  Launched in 2005 by CEO Adel Mardini, Jetex now has 750 employees based across dozens of private terminals around the world \u2013 including Dubai, Miami, Paris and Beijing.    Through a partnership with oil company Neste, in 2021 Jetex started offering sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), made from renewable waste and residue raw materials, to passengers at its Helsinki Airport terminal. That same year at its Paris Le-Bourget Airport terminal, it began offering SAF produced by French company TotalEnergies, made from used cooking oil. A limited supply of SAF means it isn\u2019t available at every airport, but the company says it wants to make SAF an alternative fuel option to its travelers across all its locations worldwide.  \u201cWe are constantly thinking of how we can work together with everyone, for climate change to (have less of an impact on) our lives and futures,\u201d Mardini told CNN, adding that Jetex is working on transforming all of its locations into fully green private terminals in the future.  Fuel scarcity Aviation accounted for over 2% of global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2021, but according to the IATA, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by 80% and will be the biggest single contributor to reaching its 2050 net zero carbon emissions target.  Scarcity, however, remains the biggest challenge, according to Dr. Suzanne Kearns, associate professor of aviation at the University of Waterloo, in Canada. \u201cWe expect that maybe 60 to 70% of (the aviation sector\u2019s) emissions reductions will come from the integration of sustainable aviation fuels. But the reality is that today, it is two to eight times as expensive as traditional aviation fuels, and its accessibility is limited, so it\u2019s not available at every airport,\u201d Dr. Kearns told CNN. She adds that if the private aviation sector became an early adopter of SAF, \u201cThe economies of scale could make them more affordable and those benefits could carry over to the other aspects of the aviation industry.\u201d   While not every airport has SAF, last week Jetex signed an agreement that lets it offer SAF to its customers around the world. Working with 360 Jet Fuel Ltd, passengers will be able to use what is known as  \u201cBook and Claim system,\u201d paying for SAF at an airport that has it, to offset some or all of the regular fuel used by the plane they are traveling on. Effectively, it means they can \u201csource\u201d SAF for flights from airports that do not have a supply.   The use of SAF in private aviation is slowly becoming more widespread. UK-based jet charter platform Victor, for example, also has a partnership with Neste and recently announced that 20% of its travelers are voluntarily opting to use some SAF for their flights, using a Book-and-Claim-style system it calls \u201cpay here, use there.\u201d  \u201cPure green\u201d Jetex also unveiled plans last year to launch what it calls the world\u2019s first \u201cpure green\u201d private terminal, at Berlin\u2019s Neuhardenberg Airport, which is home to one of the biggest solar farms in Europe. \u201cThere is the solar farm around the airport, which will fully cover energy requirements of the airport. We also plan to use electric vehicles to achieve zero-net carbon emissions,\u201d said Mardini.   With its Berlin terminal still under development, the company has been taking small steps to transform some of its other locations, including Dubai, London, Paris, and Singapore, into fully \u201cgreen\u201d terminals by the end of 2024.  Looking further ahead, Jetex is exploring the use of electrical aircraft, and has implemented strategic partnerships with urban air mobility companies including Volocopter and Eve Air Mobility to accelerate the development of eVTOL, or electric vertical takeoff and landing craft, which are sometimes referred to as flying taxis.   EVTOL aircraft have a more limited range than private jets, and would be used for short flights around and between cities \u2013 which, in the future, could be an eco-friendlier option for the many celebrities who\u2019ve been criticized for traveling short distances in their private jets. \u201cWe are seeing some really exciting innovations coming from private aviation,\u201d said Dr. Kearns. \u201cThese eVTOLs are pivotal to how people are imagining what they call advanced air mobility,\u201d she added. \u201cThese \u2026 aircraft will be moving people around urban environments without the emissions that would be produced through having traditional or conventional aviation fuel. \u201cThis entire sector is growing incredibly rapidly and it\u2019s exciting because it\u2019s an area where private aviation is actually leading the charge to move people forward to imagine what a sustainable future for air transportation could look like.\u201d  ",

It was welcomed with a water salute after it landed at the Beijing Capital International Airport at 12:31 p.m. After years of research and development, the launch of the C919 is seen as a pivotal moment in Beijing\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d strategy, which aims to boost local manufacturing, including by reducing reliance on foreign airplanes for its aviation sector. \u201cThe first commercial flight is a coming-of-age ceremony of the new aircraft, and C919 will get better and better if it stands the test of the market,\u201d said Zhang Xiaoguang, director of the marketing and sales department of COMAC, in a Xinhua report. With a range of up to 5,555 kilometers (3,452 miles), the C919 will take on the world\u2019s two major aircraft manufacturers, Airbus and Boeing. It will be a direct competitor to their A320 and B737 narrowbody jets, most commonly used for domestic and regional international flights. Built by COMAC (Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China) in China, the first C919 was delivered to China Eastern Airlines in December 2022 and in the months since has been put through a series of test flights. The single-aisle, twin-engined aircraft has 164 seats in a two-class cabin configuration consisting of business and economy seats. According to the 2022 Shanghai Science and Technology Progress Report issued by the Shanghai government, 32 clients had placed a total of 1,035 orders for the plane as of the end of 2022. Many of the plane\u2019s major elements such as the nose, fuselage, outer wing, vertical stabilizer and horizontal stabilizer were designed by COMAC.

Planes, trains and strains Funny how life goes. When Lufthansa decided in 2019 to sell nearly half of its A380 fleet back to Airbus, it didn\u2019t know a pandemic would strike the next year. Or that just a few years later, because of \u201cthe steep rise in customer demand and the delayed delivery of ordered aircraft,\u201d it would do an about-face and bring the world\u2019s largest passenger plane back into service. Or that while the six A380s earmarked for sale were in storage, they\u2019d suffer storm damage and nearly $14 million would have to be knocked off the $337 million price tag. That last detail was spotted by the sleuths at aviation magazine aeroTELEGRAPH, while poring over Airbus\u2019 annual report. But the German flag carrier isn\u2019t the only European transport provider to be getting hit in the wallet of late. Pity poor old Britain\u2019s rail networks. While France has been rebooting its TGV trains and spearheading a continent-wide \u201crail revolution\u201d \u2013 this week taking the step of banning some short-haul flights\u00a0where high-speed rail alternatives are available \u2013 in England, train customers might soon not even be able to check their emails. A Department of Transport spokesperson confirmed to CNN that free Wi-Fi could be first to face the chop in cost cuts because \u201cour railways are currently not financially sustainable.\u201d Worse things happen at sea, the saying goes.

Just a few months after bookings were opened, the voyage appears to be in crisis, with questions about the ship and passengers requesting refunds.

Waitaki Whitestone, on New Zealand\u2019s South Island, provides evidence of the Earth\u2019s eighth continent, Zealandia, formed 80 million years ago, of which 94% remains submerged. Bohol Island in the Philippines is famed for its karstic geosites, including caves, sinkholes and the cone-shaped Chocolate Hills. Law and order We regret to inform you that airline passengers are at it again. A \u201cbelligerent\u201d woman was cited after hitting a Frontier Airlines flight attendant with an intercom phone; a husband sparked outrage after flying first class and leaving his wife and kids in economy; and a man somehow opened the emergency door mid-air as an Asiana Airlines plane was coming in to land. See the terrifying footage here. And in another reminder that wild animals are not our playthings, rangers at Yellowstone National Park were forced to euthanize a bison calf that had been rejected by its herd after it was handled by a park visitor.

            "text": "Virgin Galactic \u2014 the space tourism company founded by British billionaire Richard Branson \u2014 has returned its supersonic plane to the edge of space for the first time since 2021, when Branson made his own journey toward the cosmos. The company\u2019s space plane, VSS Unity, carried two pilots and a crew of four Virgin Galactic employees on the Thursday test flight, which took off from a runway in New Mexico around 11:15 a.m. ET, according to Virgin Galactic\u2019s Twitter account. The rocket-powered plane is designed to ride to about 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) above Earth\u2019s surface while attached beneath the wing of a massive, twin-fuselage mothership, dubbed \u201cEve\u201d by the company. The space plane is designed to then detach from the mothership, fire its rocket engine and swoop straight up with its two pilots at the controls. Virgin Galactic confirmed just before 12:30 p.m. ET that VSS Unity successfully completed the blast toward space. The space plane then coasted back to a landing back at New Mexico\u2019s Spaceport America. Flights are designed to reach more than 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) above Earth, into altitudes the United States government recognizes as the boundary of outer space. VSS Unity\u2019s journey At the peak of the flight, passengers are expected to have experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and could peer out the plane\u2019s windows at Earth\u2019s curved horizon and the blackness of outer space. From takeoff to landing, the missions typically last under two hours. Company officials hope this will be the final test run before Virgin Galactic can open up rides to paying customers in late June \u2014after years of promises, missed deadlines, and Branson selling off a huge chunk of his original stake in the company. However, if the test flight encountered major issues on Thursday, the problems could throw Virgin Galactic\u2019s future into question or lead to more lengthy delays. The company has been here before. Virgin Galactic had appeared poised to begin commercial operations after it\u00a0launched Branson\u00a0to the edge of space alongside three crewmates in July 2021, a flight that came less than two weeks before Branson\u2019s rival Jeff Bezos conducted his own flight to the edge of space. Branson denied he had been racing with Bezos. But the US Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, later\u00a0opened\u00a0an investigation into Branson\u2019s flight when it was revealed that the space plane veered off course during the high-profile flight. That investigation concluded in September 2021 and gave Virgin Galactic the all-clear for more flights. But the company then announced it was delaying the start of commercial services, citing unrelated technology upgrades. The six people on Thursday\u2019s test mission included pilots CJ Sturckow and Mike Masucci, as well as Virgin Galactic employees Jamila Gilbert, a New Mexican native who works in the company\u2019s internal communications; Christopher Huie, a flight sciences engineer and the son of Jamaican immigrants; Luke Mays, an astronaut instructor and former NASA employee; and Beth Moses, the company\u2019s head of astronaut training, who has joined two prior flights. \u201cThe experience was absolutely phenomenal,\u201d Huie told CNN in an interview Thursday afternoon. \u201cI really couldn\u2019t have felt more prepared. I went into the flight feeling very confident. None of my expectations were met because this experience is just so out of this world \u2014 to use a very corny pun \u2014 but there\u2019s really nothing like it. It was exhilarating.\u201d Huie added that, to his knowledge, the flight profile and vehicle performance were spot-on for this mission. \u201cI think that people are going to just take this and have it be the best day of their lives,\u201d Gilbert added, referring to Virgin Galactic\u2019s future customers. \u201cThat is what it was for me.\u201d Virgin Galactic\u2019s path to commercial flights Branson founded Galactic in 2004, around the same time\u00a0Jeff Bezos\u00a0and\u00a0Elon Musk, two other deep-pocketed entrepreneurs, established space companies of their own. Galactic\u2019s core technology is the brainchild of a company called Scaled Composites, which is now owned by Northrop Grumman. In 2004, their SpaceShipOne won the $10 million Ansari X Prize, a cash-prize competition meant to spur innovation by making two crewed trips to space within two weeks. Branson then bought the technology in an effort to develop it for commercial use, promising paying customers a chance to take the supersonic space plane to the edge of space. The SpaceShipOne technology was parlayed into a larger space plane design, called SpaceShipTwo, which Virgin Galactic still flies today. Tragedy struck the company in 2014 when a copilot was killed during a test flight. At the time, tests were still being carried out by Scaled Composites. But the incident left the future of Virgin Galactic in doubt. The company ultimately bounced back, however, after bringing testing operations in-house and completing several test flights that successfully brushed the edge of space. Still, deadlines have continually passed for the company\u2019s expected debut of regular commercial flights with paying customers on board. At one point in early 2022, Virgin Galactic was targeting last October for its first commercial missions. At the time the company went public in 2019, it had also been touting plans to start commercial service in 2020. The future of Virgin Galactic and space tourism The company has also been losing money for years, burning through funds as it attempts to finish its test flights and begin welcoming customers \u2014 some of whom paid for their tickets more than a decade ago. The company has sold about 800 tickets total, including 600 at prices ranging from $200,000 to $250,000 and 200 more at $450,000, which is the current ticket price. Virgin Galactic is competing directly with Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin in the suborbital space tourism business. Since Bezos\u2019 flight in July 2021, the company has since completed five additional crewed flights to space. Blue Origin\u2019s suborbital space tourism operations, however, have been on pause since an uncrewed flight of its New Shepard rocket\u00a0exploded\u00a0in September 2022. Virgin Orbit, a sister company to Virgin Galactic that is focused on launching satellites to space on a small rocket,\u00a0filed for bankruptcy\u00a0in April. This week, the company announced it would sell off Virgin Orbit\u2019s assets to several other commercial space companies.",

China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the new narrow-body C919. According to the airline\u2019s app, flight MU 9191 will depart Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport at 10:45 a.m. local time, arriving at Beijing Capital International Airport at 1:10 p.m. In a message posted on its app, China Eastern Airlines said it will choose passengers via a lottery involving those who have applied to board the inaugural flight. Built by COMAC (Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China) in China, the first C919 was delivered to China Eastern Airlines in December 2022 and in the following months has been put through a series of test flights. The single-aisle, twin-engined aircraft has 164 seats in a two-class cabin configuration consisting of business and economy seats. With a range of up to 5,555 kilometers (3,452 miles), the C919 will be taking on the world\u2019s two major aircraft manufacturers, Airbus and Boeing. It will be a direct competitor to their A320 and B737 narrowbody jets, most commonly used for domestic and regional international flights. According to the 2022 Shanghai Science and Technology Progress\u00a0Report\u00a0issued by the Shanghai government, 32 clients had placed a total of 1,035 orders for the plane as of the end of 2022. Many of the plane\u2019s major elements such as the nose, fuselage, outer wing, vertical stabilizer and horizontal stabilizer were designed by COMAC. However, the company enlisted Western companies to assist with some components. This includes the plane\u2019s LEAP-1C\u00a0engines, which were developed by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and French high-tech industrial group Safran.",

            "text": "Ukraine\u2019s quest for US-made F-16 fighter jets received a big boost over the weekend when US President Joe Biden gave his backing for Kyiv\u2019s pilots to be trained to fly them. Biden\u2019s comments at a summit with G7 leaders in Japan came days after Britain and the Netherlands said they were building an \u201cinternational coalition\u201d to help Ukraine procure F-16s as it seeks to improve its defenses against Russian air attacks. The F-16s would be an upgrade to the largely Soviet-era aircraft currently in Ukraine\u2019s fleet. President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed Biden\u2019s decision, saying in a tweet, \u201cthis will greatly enhance our army in the sky.\u201d But analysts cautioned that the jets aren\u2019t a cure-all and have vulnerabilities that Moscow would be well aware of and could exploit. In fact, one active duty F-16 pilot told CNN that expectations may be way too high. \u201cTo your question about the F-16 being a difference maker. It\u2019s not,\u201d said the pilot, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the subject. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the F-16.  World\u2019s most active fighter jet F-16s are single-engine, multirole jet aircraft, meaning they can be used in air-to-air or ground-attack missions. The US Air Force calls the F-16, which first flew in the 1970s, a \u201crelatively low-cost, high-performance weapon system.\u201d Thousands of the jets have been built over the decades, and hundreds have been exported around the world. According to Flight Global\u2019s World Air Forces directory, almost 2,200 F-16s are active worldwide this year, making it the single most popular combat aircraft across the planet with 15% of the world\u2019s fleet. F-16s for Ukraine are expected to be older versions that have been in the fleets of US allies, especially those in Western Europe.  Analysts say the F-16s Ukraine would receive are not the oldest ones out there, but aircraft that have undergone what are called \u201cmid-life upgrades,\u201d meaning they\u2019ve gotten improvements to avionics and software. Ukraine has said it needs about 200 F-16s, so the numbers would work out. \u201cThere is a surplus of F-16s in Western nations, offering immediate availability and a well-established logistics trail,\u201d said Robert Hopkins, a military aviation author and former US Air Force pilot. \u201cThere are other aircraft more capable than the F-16, but they are fewer in number and are not available to transfer,\u201d Hopkins added. Those more-capable aircraft are probably ones that you commonly hear about, US-made F-35s and F/A-18s or French Rafales, for instance.  And there are others that are lesser known. \u201cThe best aircraft technically would arguably be the Swedish Grippen because of its combat capabilities, ability to operate from austere bases and easier maintenance,\u201d said Peter Layton, a fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute and former Royal Australian Air Force officer. \u201cHowever, their annual production rate is low and there are none available off the shelf.\u201d Layton gives the Netherlands as a prime example of how the F-16 might be the easiest answer for Ukraine. \u201cThe Dutch (have) about 40 F-16s on hand. These Dutch aircraft have been progressively upgraded, have relatively modern radars and avionics, and are able to use advanced weapons,\u201d Layton said. Keeping F-16s in the sky The analysts say the sheer numbers of F-16s active around the world means they have an established logistics trail and a good number of spare parts available \u2013 important components to keep the jets combat capable. But they also note that for a modern fighter jet like the F-16, training maintenance personnel can take longer than training pilots. \u201cI think it\u2019s possible to teach a Ukrainian pilot to fly an F-16 in three months,\u201d Layton said. But \u201ctraining maintenance personnel can take months or years, depending on the desired level of proficiency,\u201d according to a March report on the possible F-16 transfers from the Congressional Research Service (CRS). Even after undergoing up to 133 days of schooling, a US Air Force maintainer gains a year of on-the-job experience to become fully qualified, the CRS report says. And the report notes that there can be a numbers problem. F-16s need a lot of maintenance; 16 hours per hour of flying time, it says. As for pilot training, Layton and the active F-16 pilot who spoke to CNN both say three months of training is for the basics \u2013 getting the plane up in the air, keeping it there and landing it safely. Combat roles become much more complex, however. F-16s are easy to learn how to fly, but employing them effectively in \u201ca dynamic threat environment\u201d could take years, according to the pilot. \u201cLearning to fly an F-16 is only one part of the battle. American pilots first learn to fly, then they learn how to lead two F-16s, then four F-16s. This is a multi-year process, and that\u2019s just for the basic tactical unit of employment,\u201d the F-16 pilot said. Layton said Ukraine\u2019s current jet fighter pilots have proven adept, and could \u201clearn on the job\u201d in the F-16s if confining themselves to air defense, shooting down intruding Russian aircraft or missiles, in the short term. \u201cMy logic falls away if trying to teach them low altitude night/all-weather ground attack using infrared systems and laser guided bombs; this would take longer,\u201d Layton said. How do you hide F-16s? Then there is the question of where Ukrainian F-16s would be based. \u201cF-16s do best on long, pristine runways. They could face difficulties on the rougher, former Soviet ones dispersed across Ukraine,\u201d RAND Corp. analysts John Hoehn and William Courtney wrote in a blog post earlier this month. \u201cTo bring in Western aircraft, Ukraine might need to repave and potentially extend a number of runways, a process which Russia would likely detect. If only a few airfields were suitable and in known locations, focused Russian attacks could impede Ukrainian F-16s from flying,\u201d they wrote. Assuming Ukraine can overcome logistics and maintenance hurdles, and find secure runways from which to fly F-16s, they still need the right armaments to be effective against the key fighter jets Russia is using, like the Su-25 and MiG-31, analysts say. \u201cThe advantages of transferring advanced western fighter jets in seeking air superiority are likely to be realized only if paired with large quantities of western-manufactured munitions,\u201d the CRS report says. Advanced western armaments for the F-16s would be expensive.  For instance, a single Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) costs about $1.2 million, CRS says, adding that it takes about two years to make one. The US could provide AMRAAMs and other arms from its stockpile, but with the long manufacturing times, it runs the risk of its own inventories being depleted if needed in a conflict directly involving US forces, the CRS says. The political war and the future Despite all the possible drawbacks to F-16s, Hopkins said a political war is being fought, and victories are needed in that battlespace. Getting F-16s to Ukraine would demonstrate \u201ca powerful political and diplomatic collaboration across multiple Western (and especially NATO) countries,\u201d he said. Layton said Ukraine needs to take a long view, too. Kyiv is not going to be able to get replacements for its current Soviet-era aircraft as they wear out or are lost in combat, he said \u201cOver time, there will be no combat-effective Ukrainian air force. They need new aircraft for future air defense tasks,\u201d he said. Transitioning to a Western-made fleet now makes sense, he said. But the war in Ukraine shows no sign of ending soon, and the current F-16 pilot doesn\u2019t see the planes hastening the end of it. \u201cGetting the Ukranians F-16s will be a morale boost and add some limited combat capability, that\u2019s all,\u201d the pilot said. \u201cIt might do a couple of strikes over the next year and have some wins, but no one airplane will change the course of the war.\u201d",

            "text": "American Airlines and JetBlue Airways have to break up their alliance on Northeast US flight routes, a US District Court judge ordered Friday. US District Judge Leo Sorokin ruled in favor of the the Justice Department, giving the Biden administration a victory in its years-long lawsuit against the airlines\u2019 collaboration.  The Justice Department filed the lawsuit in 2021, alleging the two companies raised prices and reduced choice for air passengers traveling to and from major cities in the Northeast, such as New York City and Boston.  The airlines have 30 days to end their partnership, Sorokin ruled \u2013 just as the busy summer travel season kicks off. \u201cIt is abundantly clear to the Court that the defendants\u2019 primary motivation in establishing the NEA was to strengthen their own competitive positions against Delta (and, to a lesser extent, United) in Boston and New York,\u201d Sorokin wrote in the ruling Friday.  The judge\u2019s ruling Friday said that both airlines are a \u201cformidable and influential player\u201d in air travel \u2013 American Airlines Group is the largest airline in the world and JetBlue is the sixth largest airline in the United States, holding significant market power in the Northeast, in particular.  In its lawsuit, the Justice Department said the two companies committed to trading information on which routes to fly, when to fly them, who would fly them, and what size planes to use for each flight. The alliance was established in 2020.  The airlines claimed because of the alliance\u2019s codesharing features, corporate and frequent flyers had broader access to benefits and discounts. But Sorokin ruled these travelers make up a relatively small proportion of American\u2019s customers.  The judge also said the schedule optimization and coordination \u201chas led to decreased capacity, lower frequencies, or reduced consumer choices on multiple routes, including some that are heavily traveled.\u201d It effectively removed an entire competitor from these markets, according to Sorokin, leaving customers with fewer options for traveling between hubs like New York\u2019s LaGuardia and Boston\u2019s Logan airports.  Sorokin said their pact is the \u201cunreasonable restraint on trade\u201d that violates the Sherman Act, the landmark antitrust law. \u201cThough the defendants claim their bigger-is-better collaboration will benefit the flying public, they produced minimal objectively credible proof to support that claim,\u201d Sorokin said.  The Justice Department also alleged the two airlines shared revenues earned at these airports, eliminating their incentives to compete with one another. In addition, the \u201cNortheast Alliance\u201d allowed the parties to pool their gates and takeoff and landing authorizations, known as \u201cslots,\u201d according to the complaint. Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the DOJ\u2019s Antitrust Division said in a statement Friday he was \u201cpleased\u201d with the decision.  \u201cToday\u2019s decision is a win for Americans who rely on competition between airlines to travel affordably,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement Friday.  In a statement, American Airlines said it is \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the court\u2019s decision and that it\u2019s \u201cstudying the judgment in full\u201d and evaluating its \u201cnext steps as part of the legal process.\u201d \u201cWe made it clear at trial that the Northeast Alliance has been a huge win for customers,\u201d American said. \u201cThrough the NEA, JetBlue has been able to significantly grow in constrained northeast airports, bringing the airline\u2019s low fares and great service to more routes than would have been possible otherwise.\u201d CNN has reached out to JetBlue for comment. In March, the Justice Department sued to stop JetBlue\u2019s $3.8 billion offer to buy Spirit Airlines. Garland said the merger would significantly harm consumers, particularly those who depend on the low fares available on the budget Spirit Airlines.",

            "text": "Warren Buffett\u2019s conglomerate has sold its remaining shares in the world\u2019s largest chipmaker, TSMC, after the \u201cOracle of Omaha\u201d sounded alarms about its homebase of Taiwan. In a Monday filing, Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKA) disclosed that it was no longer holding a stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company\n            \n                (TSM) as of the end of the first quarter.  In recent weeks, Buffett had repeatedly expressed concerns over the future of Taiwan, the self-governed democratic island where TSMC is based. China\u2019s Communist leadership has long claimed Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never ruled over it. The move completes an exit from TSMC by one of the world\u2019s most watched investors, which had already been winding down its stake in recent months.  In February, Berkshire revealed it had sold 86% of its shares in TSMC, which were purchased for $4.1 billion just months before. The quick sale was considered unusual because Buffett is known for making longer term bets. Asked to explain his decision on an analyst call this month, the billionaire said: \u201cI don\u2019t like its location, and I\u2019ve reevaluated that.\u201d \u201cI feel better about the capital that we\u2019ve got deployed in Japan than in Taiwan,\u201d the Berkshire Hathaway chairman added. \u201cI wish it weren\u2019t sold, but I think that\u2019s a reality.\u201d Despite the share sale, Buffett lauded TSMC as \u201cone of the best-managed companies and [most] important companies in the world.\u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s no one in the chip industry that\u2019s in their league, at least in my view,\u201d he said.  \u201cMarvelous people and marvelous competitive position and everything, [but] I\u2019d rather find it in the United States.\u201d Buffett said his reassessment of the company was in \u201clight of certain things that were going on.\u201d He had previously pointed to geopolitical tensions as a concern.  TSMC declined to comment Tuesday on Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s divestment. \u2018Silicon shield\u2019 TSMC is considered a national treasure in Taiwan, supplying semiconductors to global tech giants including Apple\n            \n                (AAPL) and Qualcomm\n            \n                (QCOM).  It mass produces the most advanced semiconductors in the world, components that are vital to the smooth running of everything from smartphones to washing machines. The firm is the world\u2019s largest chip manufacturer, according to Gartner. It\u2019s also one of the world\u2019s most valuable listed companies, with a market capitalization of 12.8 trillion New Taiwan Dollars (approximately $415.3 billion) as of Tuesday. TSMC\u2019s presence is seen as providing a strong incentive to the West to defend Taiwan against any attempt by China to take it by force. The company is perceived as being so valuable to the global economy, as well as to China, that it is sometimes even referred to as forming part of a \u201csilicon shield\u201d against a potential military invasion by Beijing. While TSMC is expanding overseas in countries including the United States, it\u2019s also growing its footprint back home in Taiwan, where it plans to add more than 6,000 jobs this year. As Berkshire Hathaway revealed its withdrawal Monday, other prominent investors made bets on the stock. According to a regulatory filing, Macquarie has increased its stake in TSMC, while Tiger Global has also bought in.  TSMC stock rose 2% Tuesday in Taipei, while its US-listed shares slipped 0.5% in after-hours trading in New York.",

The deal is worth $40 billion at list prices, Ryanair\n            \n                (RYAAY) said in a statement Tuesday, which contained none of the sharp criticism that CEO Michael O\u2019Leary has previously leveled at Boeing because of delays in delivering aircraft the airline had ordered.  Boeing\u2019s share price gained more than 3% in New York. Ryanair was up 2%. The planes, the largest of Boeing\u2019s\n            \n                (BA) 737 Max aircraft, will be delivered between 2027 and 2033. Europe\u2019s biggest budget carrier said the purchase will help it grow passenger numbers from 168 million in the year to March 2023 to 300 million by March 2034.   \u201cThis new order will enable Ryanair to deliver sustained traffic and tourism growth at lower fares (and lower emissions per flight) across all European countries where Ryanair continues to lead the post Covid traffic, tourism and jobs recovery,\u201d Ryanair added. The low-cost carrier has recovered from the pandemic faster than much of the aviation industry, growing its market share as several competitors went bankrupt or cut their fleets and passenger capacity.  Ryanair posted record profit for the three months to December 31, after increasing airfares by 14% compared to their pre-pandemic level. It will report full year earnings on May 22. Ryanair, Boeing on better terms On Tuesday, O\u2019Leary said the carrier was \u201cpleased to sign this record aircraft order,\u201d for \u201clarger, more efficient, greener aircraft.\u201d The outspoken airline boss last year broke off talks with Boeing over a pricing squabble and described the planemaker\u2019s management as \u201cheadless chickens\u201d in scathing, profanity-laced criticism of the delivery delays. Asked during an interview on CNBC Tuesday if he regretted those comments, O\u2019Leary said he did not, although he added, \u201cI frequently shoot my mouth off, not always necessarily accurately.\u201d \u201cThis is a bit like a marriage. We have occasional fights, we squabble occasionally, but we kiss and make up and then I pay up.\u201d In the same interview, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said he was fine with O\u2019Leary\u2019s earlier criticism. \u201cHe was clear. His emotions showed,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was an incredibly important message for the Boeing company to hear, for me to hear, for our team in Seattle to hear.\u201d At a news conference Tuesday, O\u2019Leary said Boeing had made significant progress in catching up, according to Reuters. On prices, the Ryanair CEO said: \u201cIn our view it will never be cheap enough and in Boeing\u2019s view it is always far too cheap.\u201d  The transaction will be subject to shareholder approval at Ryanair\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in September. Ryanair is one of Boeing\u2019s largest customers, with more than 600 planes in its fleet or on order, according to its website. The deal is a rare piece of good news for Boeing, which has struggled to recover from two fatal crashes involving the 737 Max aircraft. The planemaker has reported only one profitable quarter since the 737 Max was grounded for 20 months starting in March 2019.  Boeing has fallen far behind rival Airbus\n            \n                (EADSF) in sales of the single-aisle jets that dominate the commercial plane market. But it has also had problems in the widebody jet segment where it is more competitive.  It had to halt deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner for more than a year due to quality control problems and delay the final development of its newest wide-body aircraft, the 777X, which now won\u2019t be ready until at least 2025. \u2014 Chris Isidore contributed reporting.",

            "title": "Virgin Galactic prepared to launch to the edge of space after hiatus",
            "text": "Virgin Galactic,\u00a0the suborbital space tourism company founded by British billionaire Richard Branson,\u00a0is gearing up for its first flight to the edge of space in nearly two years.  The flight, slated for late May, will carry two pilots and a crew of four Virgin Galactic employees, the company announced Monday. The company expects it will be the final test run before Virgin Galactic can open up rides for paying customers after years of promises, missed deadlines, and Branson selling off a huge chunk of his original stake in the company. If all goes well, Virgin Galactic expects to begin commercial services out of its spaceport in New Mexico in late June. Virgin Galactic had appeared poised to begin commercial operations after it launched Branson to the edge of space alongside three crewmates in July 2021, a flight that came less than two weeks before Branson\u2019s rival Jeff Bezos conducted his own flight to the edge of space. Branson denied he had been racing with Bezos. But the Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, later opened an investigation into Branson\u2019s flight when it was revealed that the space plane veered off course during the high-profile flight.  That investigation concluded in September 2021 and gave Virgin Galactic the all-clear for more flights. But the company then announced it was delaying the start of commercial services, citing unrelated technology upgrades.  Several deadlines for the company\u2019s expected return to space have passed. At one point in early 2022, the company was targeting as early as last October for its first commercial missions. At the time Virgin Galactic went public in 2019, it had also been touting plans to start commercial service in 2020.  \u201cWe are making good progress on validating the enhancements made throughout 2022, and we remain on track for commercial service in Q2 of this year,\u201d CEO Michael Colglazier told investors during the company\u2019s latest earnings call on February 28, 2023. Virgin Galactic conducted several test flights before Branson\u2019s flight in 2021. But since then, the company has flown only one test flight of VSS Unity, which sent the space plane gliding through the air but did not attempt to fire up the plane\u2019s rocket engine. The company has also been losing money for years, burning through funds as it attempts to finish its qualification flights and begin welcoming customers on board \u2014 some of whom paid for their tickets more than a decade ago. The company has sold about 800 tickets total, including 600 at prices ranging from $200,000 to $250,000 and 200 more at $450,000, which is the current ticket price, a spokesperson confirmed on Monday. Virgin Galactic is competing directly with Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin in the suborbital space tourism business. Since Bezos\u2019 flight in July 2021, the company has since completed five additional crewed flights to space. Blue Origin\u2019s operations, however, have been on pause since an uncrewed flight of its New Shepard rocket exploded in September 2022. Six people will be on board Virgin Galactic\u2019s VSS Unity space plane for this month\u2019s test mission. They include two pilots \u2014 CJ Sturckow and Mike Masucci \u2014 as well as four Virgin Galactic employees who will ride in the passenger cabin. Those four are Jamila Gilbert, a New Mexican native who works in the company\u2019s internal communications; Chris Hume, a flight sciences engineer and the son of Jamaican immigrants; Luke Mays, an astronaut instructor and former NASA employee; and Beth Moses, the company\u2019s head of astronaut training, who has joined two prior flights. Virgin Galactic\u2019s rocket-powered plane, called VSS Unity, is designed to ride to about 50,000 feet while attached beneath the wing of a massive, twin-fuselage mothership, dubbed \u201cEve\u201d by the company. The space plane is designed to then detach from the mothership, fire its rocket engine and swoop straight up with its two pilots at the controls. Flights are designed to reach more than 50 miles above Earth, into altitudes the US government recognizes as the boundary of outer space.  Not every institution recognizes the 50-mile mark. Internationally, it\u2019s more common to use the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Line, which lies 62 miles (100 kilometers) above Earth\u2019s surface. At the peak of the flight, customers are expected to experience a few minutes of weightlessness and can peer out the plane\u2019s windows at Earth\u2019s curved horizon and the blackness of outer space. VSS Unity then aims to glide to a landing back at the launch site. From takeoff to landing, the missions typically last under two hours.  Virgin Orbit, a sister company to Virgin Galactic that is focused on launching satellites to space on a small rocket, filed for bankruptcy in April.",

            "text": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway reported a jump in earnings in the first quarter of 2023 ahead of the Oracle of Omaha\u2019s annual shareholders meeting. Operating earnings increased about 12% from the prior year to $8.065 billion in the first quarter, the earnings release said Saturday. Operating earnings are the profit left after costs from a business\u2019 core operations are taken out.  The conglomerate posted a $35.5 billion first-quarter profit. The jump in earnings is attributed in part to a comeback in Berkshire\u2019s insurance empire.  The company\u2019s insurance underwriting business saw a clear spike, from earnings of $167 million in the first quarter of 2022 to $911 million now. Insurance investment income increased from $1.17 billion to $1.97 billion.  Geico, which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway, had a $1.9 billion pretax underwriting loss at year\u2019s end, after losing market share to competitor Progressive. So far this year, it is faring better, posting an underwriting profit of $703 million in this year\u2019s Q1, thanks to higher average premiums and lower advertising costs, despite lower claims frequencies.  However, Berkshire\u2019s energy company and freight railroad company, BNSF, had a decrease in earnings compared to this quarter last year.  Berkshire also bought back approximately $4.4 billion in stocks, and its cash hoard increased to $130.6 billion from $128 billion in 2022 Q4.  Coined \u201cWoodstock for Capitalists,\u201d the annual meeting will feature Buffett, 92, and Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger, 99, who took the stage on Saturday to answer questions from shareholders and engage in discussion about the business and broader economy.

            "title": "Frankfurt to Dubai in 90 minutes? Europe enters the hypersonic plane race",
            "text": "It\u2019s now been two decades since the era of supersonic commercial flight ended with Concorde\u2019s final touchdown in an airfield in southwest England.  In recent years, numerous pretenders to the throne \u2013 supersonic, hypersonic, hydrogen-powered, with anti-boom technology \u2013 have been whizzing round, conceptually at least, but many of these projects promising seamless super-fast travel have instead stalled, sputtered out or hit delays.  Now a European hypersonic startup is having a go, promising enticing journey times such as Frankfurt to Sydney in 4 hours 15, or Memphis to Dubai in 3 hours 30.  The Destinus concept is hydrogen-powered flight at five times the speed of sound, cutting flight duration to less than a quarter of current commercial air travel.  Headquartered in Switzerland with a team of around 120 staff spread out in Spain, France and Germany, Destinus was established in 2021 but has been hitting milestones fast. Its first two prototypes have made successful test flights and are about to start testing hydrogen-powered flight. Its third prototype \u2013 Destinus 3 \u2013 is set to make its inaugural flight by the end of the year.  Martina L\u00f6fqvist, the company\u2019s business development manager, caught up with CNN over video call to explain its model and why the team hopes it can be the one to finally usher in the new age of hypersonic travel.  The fuel \u201cThere are different approaches to doing this,\u201d says L\u00f6fqvist. While other top contenders in the field such as Boom Supersonic are \u201cfocusing more on the development of the mockups and understanding of how it works and trying to get these piloted aircraft working, we\u2019re going directly to autonomous flights.\u201d The strategy is to \u201cdevelop smaller-size drones before we scale it up to become a large pilot-driven or passenger-carrying aircraft.\u201d Hydrogen is the Destinus fuel of choice due to it being a clean, renewable energy source, increasingly inexpensive to produce, and capable of helping it realize its speed and long-range ambitions. Hydrogen-powered aviation is still in its infancy, with hydrogen jet engines yet to enter commercial use. Airbus is developing a hydrogen jet engine it says will begin flight testing in 2026.  \u201cWe try to go very, very ultra-long range with our vehicles,\u201d says L\u00f6fqvist, \u201cand that is to fly from Europe all the way to Australia at Mach 5. Using kerosene means that the vehicle would become quite heavy, while hydrogen is very light in comparison.\u201d Hydrogen also has higher energy density than traditional jet fuel.  The long-term goal is to fully hydrogen-powered and zero emissions, but while hydrogen production is still scaling up, its short-term plan is to power takeoff with Jet A \u2013 conventional aviation fuel \u2013 for the subsonic part and then switch to hydrogen later. Says L\u00f6fqvist, \u201cHydrogen doesn\u2019t really become useful or better than Jet A until you get up to supersonic speeds.\u201d  The design  The Destinus prototypes are blended-body planes in the waverider shape \u2014 a hypersonic design first conceived in the 1950s but never yet reaching production \u2014 with the company\u2019s Swiss/French origins being reflected in paintwork inspired by the Alps.  The now classic shape has \u201cbeen studied for many, many, many years,\u201d says L\u00f6fqvist. \u201cThe purpose of it is so that you can ride on top of the shock waves that are generated from the vehicle itself. It\u2019s a pretty efficient shape\u201d because it improves the lift-to-drag ratio when flying above the speed of sound. Naturally, with every new prototype Destinus is refining and adjusting the design. Two decades from now, the team expects the crafts it\u2019s working with to look a little different from the models it\u2019s testing now.  The upcoming prototype, Destinus 3, will be supersonic and the hope is for it to achieve supersonic hydrogen-powered flight in 2024. \u201cThis is a pretty massive vehicle,\u201d says L\u00f6fqvist. \u201cIt\u2019s about the same size as the previous prototype in terms of being around 10 meters (long), but it\u2019s 10 times heavier, and probably 20 times more complex as well, in terms of the structure and in terms of the propulsion system.\u201d  The hoped-for timeline is that by the 2030s the company will be able to launch a smaller-scale aircraft, holding around 25 passengers, which will have some limitation in terms of range and be fully focused on business class customers.  By the 2040s, its fully scaled-up version will have multiple classes, including economy. They\u2019re hoping that by then \u201chydrogen prices will drop significantly, so that we can then reduce the prices of the flights, significantly as well, for these ultra-long-range flights.\u201d  Finances The company\u2019s plans are quite dependent on the vagaries of the hydrogen market, which L\u00f6fqvist freely admits it\u2019s not in control of, but experts inside and outside of the company have advised that they estimate prices to drop.  Last month Destinus acquired Dutch company OPRA, now named Destinus Energy. Says L\u00f6fqvist, \u201cThis means that we can have revenues already this year, because they already have gas turbines that are built and being sold. We\u2019ll have now not just that hypersonic airplane aerospace side, but we\u2019ll also have some of these energy aspects within the company as well.\u201d In addition to the private investment and public funding it already obtained \u2013 in April 2023 it secured grants worth 26.7 million euros ($29.4 million) from the Spanish government to expand its hydrogen propulsion capabilities \u2013 Destinus hopes this additional revenue will help it weather the challenges that have seen other supersonic and hypersonic projects fall to the wayside. L\u00f6fqvist emphasizes that the company is aiming for a \u201crealistic\u201d approach \u201cnow that the funding environment is a bit tougher.\u201d  Nevada-based Aerion, which was a major contender in the race to be the first to build a supersonic passenger jet, collapsed in May 2021, declaring that \u201cin the current financial environment, it has proven hugely challenging to close on the scheduled and necessary large new capital requirements.\u201d As for whether we\u2019ll be hopping on hypersonic jets by the 2040s, breakfasting in Shanghai and hitting Sao Paulo just after lunch, there may be a few technological, environmental and financial hurdles to overcome before then. But it won\u2019t be want for trying.",

His comments came a day after the cash-strapped Indian airline filed for bankruptcy, blaming \u201cfaulty\u201d Pratt & Whitney (P&W) engines for the grounding of about half its fleet. The insolvency proceedings were aimed at reviving the airline and not selling it, CEO Kaushik Khona said, confirming it had made all required payments to Pratt & Whitney. The airline was also looking to dissuade lessors from taking action. \u201cThe Indian government is very keen we should not fail,\u201d Khona told Reuters. The company, which is \u201ccontinuously evaluating options\u201d, said some parties have expressed interest in the airline. It did not share further details. Go First\u2019s lenders will most likely meet on Wednesday to discuss what to do next after the bankruptcy filing on Tuesday, two bankers aware of the development told Reuters. The airline owed financial creditors 65.21 billion Indian rupees ($797 million), its bankruptcy filing showed. As of April 30, Go First had not defaulted on any of those loans, it said in the filing seen by Reuters. Boon for rivals Go First\u2019s bankruptcy may boost airfares in India and give other domestic airlines a chance to grab a larger chunk of the market share, analysts said. Share prices of India\u2019s largest airline, IndiGo, were up 5.1% on Wednesday, after rising as much as 8.2% earlier. \u201cIf the suspension is prolonged, other airlines that are adding capacity would look to avail the slots vacated by Go First and grab onto the market share,\u201d Jefferies analyst Prateek Kumar said in a client note. \u201cIndigo is facing a similar problem with P&W engines for some of its fleet but has been able to better maneuver the crisis owing to its much larger fleet size and better negotiations with the vendor,\u201d Kumar added. Lessors may also be eager to allocate some Go First aircraft to IndiGo, given a similar fleet type, Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a note, adding that such a development would benefit IndiGo in terms of market share and stronger yields in a capacity-strained environment. Lenders to Go First, including Central Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, IDBI Bank and Axis Bank, fell on Wednesday. The Wadia Group also runs bread and biscuits maker Britannia Industries and textile firm Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Co. Share prices of Bombay Burmah Trading, which is also owned by Wadia and has given loans to Go First in the form of inter-corporate deposits, slid 5%.",

            "text": "American Airlines pilots voted to go on strike Monday. Southwest pilots are holding a strike vote as well. But none of those union members will be allowed to go on strike anytime soon \u2014 if at all \u2014 under the labor law that applies to airline workers. That law is the Railway Labor Act, which, despite he name, covers both rail workers and airline employees. Those are two of the most heavily unionized US industries, and the law places considerable hurdles in the way of any union that wants to strike. The pilots have cleared exactly zero of those hurdles so far. If federally mediated union negotiations reach an impasse, a union can be given permission to strike. But the law allows the president to step in at the last moment and order workers to stay on the job for a months-long \u201ccooling off periods\u201d while a presidential panel comes up with recommendations as to how to settle the deadlock.  If the two sides can\u2019t reach a deal during that cooling off period, the union could then go on strike \u2014 but only if Congress stays on the sideline and allows the strike to take place. But it\u2019s possible that Congress would act to block a strike. That\u2019s what happened with the freight railroads last December when Congress imposed a contract on the angry rail unions to keep the railroads operating. Why pilots voted to strike This doesn\u2019t mean that the airline unions and their members aren\u2019t serious about going on strike if given the chance. Most airline employees have gone years without pay raises, and they have endured extremely difficult working conditions during the pandemic.  Many unions have had members participate in informational pickets at major airports, at American pilots did Monday. \u201cMembership has spoken. We will strike if necessary to secure the industry-leading contract that our pilots have earned and deserve,\u201d said Capt. Ed Sicher, president of the Allied Pilots Association, the union that represents American pilots. \u201cOur pilots\u2019 resolve is unmistakable. We will not be deterred from our goal.\u201d A history of airline strikes There have been airline strikes in the past, but because of the hurdle, they are very rare and generally with relatively small carriers.  Spirit Airlines pilots struck for a week in 2010, but the airline was much smaller then - with only about 1% of domestic air traffic at that time.  The last time a major airline was grounded by a strike was 25 years ago when Northwest Airlines pilots went on strike for two weeks. Northwest was then the fourth largest US airline, but back then there was far less consolidation in the industry.  Since 1998, the 11 largest US airlines have merged to become the four largest carriers today, including Southwest and American. Those two, along with Delta and United, carry 80% of US air traffic between them. Why a strike is unlikely It\u2019s unlikely that Congress would allow any of the four major carriers to go on strike. When Southwest had a service meltdown over the holidays that forced it to ground more than half its scheduled flights, it sparked a Congressional hearing to look into the problem. And strike votes, in and of themselves, don\u2019t mean that a union is going to go on strike.  Strike votes are a common negotiating tactic taken during talks. They virtually always pass by an overwhelming margin. But most negotiations are settled, even after a strike vote, without a work stoppage. Delta\u2019s pilots approved a strike vote last year, and quickly reached a lucrative deal that gave them a 34% average raise. American and Southwest both said this week that they are not particularly concerned about the strike vote by its pilots. The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association\u2019s \u201cauthorization vote will not affect Southwest\u2019s operation or our ability to take care of our customers,\u201d said Adam Carlisle, vice president of labor relations at Southwest. \u201cOur negotiations continue, with talks resuming this week, and we\u2019ll keep working \u2026 to reach an agreement that rewards our pilots.\u201d \u201cWe remain confident that an agreement for our pilots is within reach and can be finalized quickly. The finish line is in sight,\u201d said American spokesperson Curtis Blessing. \u201cWe understand that a strike authorization vote is one of the important ways pilots express their desire to get a deal done and we respect the message of voting results.\u201d",

            "text": "The Federal Aviation Administration initially overrode its own engineers\u2019 recommendations in 2019 to ground the Boeing 737 Max after a second fatal crash, according to a new watchdog report. The inspector general for the Department of Transportation said investigators interviewed agency officials and reviewed evidence showing engineers at the FAA\u2019s aircraft certification office overseeing Boeing \u201crecommended grounding the airplane while the accident was being investigated based on what they perceived as similarities between\u201d the two fatal crashes. There was also competing data, the report said, suggesting the crashes were not related to the same system. \u201cYet Agency officials at Headquarters and the Seattle ACO opted not to do so; instead, they waited for more detailed data to arrive,\u201d the report concluded.  The conversations were taking place after the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on March 10, 2019. Lion Air Flight 610 crashed October 29, 2018. The crashes killed a combined 346 people. The US did not ground the plane until three days after the crash, after every other country worldwide had. The grounding ultimately lasted nearly two years. The inspector general report, released Friday, recommended the agency update and improve its policies for evaluating crashes and other events. The FAA told the inspector general it would make updates and develop formal training. While awaiting additional data in March 2019, FAA officials issued an official notice backing up their decision to allow the Max to continue flying. An engineer drafted an analysis which showed the risk of fatalities to be 13 times higher than the relevant FAA standard. \u201cHowever,\u201d the inspector general\u2019s report said, \u201cthis document was not completed and did not go through managerial review due to lack of detailed flight data.\u201d The inspector general concluded the FAA\u2019s decision-making on the grounding after the second crash \u201caligned with its typical processes\u201d by waiting for detailed data, but called the processes \u201coutdated\u201d and said officials are not uniformly trained on how to use them.  The FAA told the inspector general it is updating its guidelines for grounding an aircraft when it discovers an urgent safety issue, and told CNN in a statement it \u201cconcurs with the Inspector General\u2019s recommendations.\u201d \u201cThe agency also identified the issues outlined in the report before it was issued and is working to address them,\u201d the FAA said. \u201cAs we incorporate these recommendations, we also continue to look for additional opportunities to apply lessons learned from the Boeing 737 MAX\u2019s return to service.\u201d",

The e-commerce giant on Thursday reported a profit of $3.2 billion for the first quarter, up from a loss of $3.8 billion in the year ago quarter and far exceeding analysts estimates. The swing to a profit comes as Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN) has ramped up its cost-cutting measures in recent months. The company has announced two rounds of layoffs, canceled products and nixed physical store expansions. It also comes as key areas of Amazon\u2019s business continue to grow despite lingering recession fears possibly weighing on corporate and consumer spending. The company\u2019s revenue increased 9% during the quarter from the prior year. Amazon expects second-quarter net sales to grow between 5% and 10% from the same period the year before, or be between $127 billion and $133 billion. \u201cThe results indicate that ongoing cost-cutting measures are having a positive impact on Amazon\u2019s business prospects,\u201d said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com. \u201cAmazon\u2019s strong guidance for Q2 revenue is another indicator that the company may be starting to come out of the woods.\u201d Amazon Web Services, which has long served as a profit engine for the company, also experienced double-digit percentage growth during the quarter, in another positive sign for its overall business.  AWS segment sales rose 16% from the year before to $21.4 billion. That comes after sales growth slowed in the previous quarter, as cloud customers tightened their purse strings due to uncertainty about the economy\u2019s health. \u201cWhile our AWS business navigates companies spending more cautiously in this macro environment, we continue to prioritize building long-term customer relationships,\u201d CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement accompanying the earnings release.",

            "text": "Losses continued to mount for Boeing, as the supply chain problems caused higher-than-expected losses. The company reported a loss of $1.27 per share, excluding special, one-off charges and gains. Although that was an improvement from the $2.75 a share it lost on that basis a year earlier, it marked the seventh-straight quarter in which Boeing reported a loss, excluding one-time items.  Since the grounding of the 737 Max in March of 2019, following two crashes that killed 346 people, Boeing has reported only one quarterly profit without the help of special items. The loss was worse than the forecast of a $1.07 a share from analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. And those analysts don\u2019t expect a near-term end of the red ink at Boeing, with another loss forecast for the current quarter. Wall Street expects only narrow profits in the second half of the year, which are expected to leave Boeing with an annual loss for the fifth-straight year. The company disclosed earlier this month that a \u201csignificant number\u201d of 737 Max jets in production had been affected by a \u201cnon-standard manufacturing process\u201d by one of its suppliers which would affect near-term deliveries and production. But Boeing reaffirmed its earlier guidance that it expects have a positive cash flow this year, and said it expects to build 38 737 Max jets a month later this year, and to deliver 400 to 450 of the planes.  Company executives said, despite these latest problems with the 737 Max, its financial results show progress for the company, because its loss is smaller than its loss from a year earlier. \u201cWe continue to make real progress, steady progress in our recovery,\u201d said CEO Dave Calhoun. \u201cChallenges remain. There\u2019s more to do. But overall, we feel good about the operational and financial outlook.\u201d Calhoun insisted both Boeing and its supplier Spirit AeroSystems\n            \n                (SPR) know how to fix the problems that were discovered with the 737 Max assembly and that there is no risk to the planes that are already in operation. But he confirmed that deliveries will be delayed in the coming months, which will affect the ability of some Boeing customers to fly the full schedule of flights they had intended this summer. \u201cWe feel terrible about that,\u201d he said. But the Max is not the only plane for which Boeing is trying to recover from problems. The 787 Dreamliner had deliveries halted for about a year due to quality control issues and only resumed deliveries in September. The company booked $379 million in increased costs for the 787 program in the first quarter along with an undisclosed amount of compensation to airline customer which had deliveries delayed. It also still has some of the 787 Dreamliners that need modification in its inventory.  Boeing traditionally has not had inventory of completed planes, delivering them and receiving payment soon after completing assembly. But it has been stuck with unusually high inventory numbers ever since it continued production of the 737 Max during its 20-month grounding. It still has 225 of the Max in inventory, with 138 of those planes awaiting delivery to China.  While Chinese aviation authorities are again allowing the 737 Max to fly there, Chinese airlines have yet to accept delivery of any of those planes. The rising trade tensions between the United States and China have essentially shut Boeing out of that key market for several years now. \u201cWe are working very hard to regain China,\u201d Calhoun told investors.  Still despite all the continued problems and bigger than forecast loss, Boeing\n            \n                (BA)\u2019s assurances on cash flow and full-year 737 Max deliveries helped lift shares of Boeing\n            \n                (BA) 3% in midday trading.",

            "text": "Two incidents involving American Airlines flights \u2013 one of them an apparent bird strike \u2013 frightened passengers who saw flames flowing from their aircraft.  In one of the incidents, Phoenix-bound Flight 1958 returned to the airport in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday morning after the crew calmly reached out to controllers: \u201cMayday. Mayday. Mayday, American 1958. We\u2019ve had a bird strike and an engine failure.\u201d The Federal Aviation Administration has said bird strikes are a growing concern, due in part to increasing populations of large birds and their inability to hear quieter engines. Ben Nines was jogging on the Ohio State University campus when he heard a loud pulsing sound. \u201cIt sounded like an old Jet Ski jumping across waves but much louder than a typical plane,\u201d Nines told CNN. Video showed at least seven spurts of fire from the plane\u2019s right side.  Onboard, Matthew Danek heard strange, rumbling sounds during the flight climb-out. \u201cGenuinely, this was the first time in my life that I was ready to die,\u201d he told CNN affiliate WBNS. Another passenger told affiliate WSYX about the terrifying minutes. \u201cEverybody was just very shaken up and all of us could see what happening out of the windows on the right-hand side.\u201d The Boeing 737 \u2013 which has two engines \u2013 made a safe return to John Glenn Columbus International Airport, said the Federal Aviation Administration, which is investigating. Danek praised the crew for keeping everyone calm during the landing. American Airlines said there was a \u201cmechanical issue\u201d during the flight. The airport later tweeted the incident did not involve an engine fire. CNN has reached out to American Airlines for further comment. Despite possible catastrophic consequences, a tiny percentage of bird strikes end in injuries. The FAA received 17,191 reports in 2022; thus far in 2023, the tally is 2,319 reports. Perhaps the best-known bird strike incident was the \u201cMiracle on the Hudson,\u201d on January 15, 2009, when a United Airlines flight was struck by geese and made an emergency landing in the Hudson River in New York. The agency said the increase in bird strikes has put more emphasis on research and wildlife management. The Columbus airport has used flares and other measures to deter birds from nearing runways.  The other American Airlines incident occurred last Thursday when the crew of Flight 2288 canceled takeoff from Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina. The plane was bound for Dallas-Fort Worth with five crew members and 200 passengers. The FAA said there was an engine fire. Video taken by passenger Frankie Leggington captured smoke and flames spewing from a wing of the Airbus A321. \u201cNobody knows what\u2019s happening so it\u2019s everyone\u2019s first instinct, is the plane is going to blow,\u201d Leggington told CNN affiliate WSOC. \u201cSo, everyone is grabbing their bags trying to run up and run in the aisle.\u201d The aircraft suffered a mechanical issue and was returned to the gate and taken out of service for maintenance, the airline said.",

            "text": "A group of progressive Tesla shareholders want the company\u2019s board of directors to make CEO Elon Musk concentrate more on one of his many jobs, that of running the EV automaker. In a letter to the Tesla board, the group says that Musk is not spending enough time and attention focused on issues facing the company, including increased EV competition from other automakers, and addressing issues important to the group, including allegations of a toxic work environment at Tesla. In addition to his role at Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA), Musk also leads Twitter, SpaceX, the Boring Company, and Neuralink, among others. \u201cWe each initially added Tesla to our portfolios because we saw Tesla as a true leader in producing products and services essential for our transition to a sustainable and green economy,\u201d the letter said. \u201cOver time, however, we have grown increasingly concerned with governance and leadership issues at the company.\u201d Among the entities signing the letter are Amalgamated Bank, a union-owned bank, as well as Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, United Church Funds, Investor Advocates for Social Justice and the New York City Controller\u2019s Office. The letter says that the investors signing the letter own $1.5 billion worth of Tesla shares, which represents well less than 1% of Tesla shares.  By comparison, Musk owns or has options to purchase about $118 billion worth of Tesla shares, representing 20% of the stock. Musk has a net worth of $175 billion, according to Forbes. The letter alleges Musk\u2019s lack of focus at Tesla is causing problems for the company, such as a high turnover rate with its staff due to its work environment. But it doesn\u2019t spell out what should be done to make him focus on those problems. \u201cTesla needs a board that will ensure that the CEO is focused on addressing its challenges,\u201d said the letter. \u201cDue to the board\u2019s failure to restrict the CEO\u2019s outside commitments and ensure he is focused on solving the many challenges the company faces, we have lost confidence in its members.\u201d Ivan Frishberg, chief sustainability officer at Amalgamated Bank, said that there are other investors who are concerned about Musk becoming distracted, especially with his recent purchase of Twitter, as well as his ownership and running of SpaceX and a number of other companies. Frishberg said the group is not advocating that Musk be replaced at CEO. \u201cWe\u2019re a Tesla investor,\u201d he said. \u201cIn terms of governance, we\u2019d like the board room to become less clubby and more independent and responsive to investors.\u201d Musk is now essentially working for Tesla for free, with no cash salary, and after being granted a final block of stock options from a 2018 pay package earlier this year, there are no additional stock options that he can qualify for at the moment.  Some analysts have said that they expect, and would advocate, that Tesla announce a new pay package for Musk as a way to assure Wall Street that Tesla is still his priority, despite his other CEO jobs. But Frishberg objected to that idea. \u201cI don\u2019t think throwing more money at the guy is the answer,\u201d he said.",

            "text": "SpaceX\u2019s Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, took off from a launchpad in South Texas at 9:33 a.m. ET Thursday but exploded midair before stage separation. Thursday\u2019s launch marked the vehicle\u2019s historic first test flight. \u201cAs if the flight test was not exciting enough, Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly before stage separation,\u201d SpaceX tweeted. The massive Super Heavy rocket booster, which houses 33 engines, lifted off and sent a massive boom across the coastal landscape as it fired to life. The Starship spacecraft, riding atop the booster, soared out over the Gulf of Mexico. About 2\u00bd minutes after takeoff, the Super Heavy rocket booster was scheduled to expend most of its fuel and separate from the Starship spacecraft, leaving the booster to be discarded in the ocean. The Starship was meant to use its own engines, blazing for more than six minutes, to propel itself to nearly orbital speeds.  The flight reached its highest point 24.2 miles (39 kilometers) above the ground, and the explosion occurred about four minutes after liftoff, according to SpaceX. \u201cThe vehicle experienced multiple engines out during the flight test, lost altitude, and began to tumble,\u201d according to an update from SpaceX. \u201cThe flight termination system was commanded on both the booster and ship.\u201d SpaceX said that \u201cteams will continue to review data and work toward our next flight test.\u201d The road and beach near the launchpad are expected to remain closed until Friday. \u201cAn anomaly occurred during the ascent and prior to stage separation resulting in a loss of the vehicle.  No injuries or public property damage have been reported,\u201d according to a statement Thursday afternoon by the Federal Aviation Administration.  \u201cThe FAA will oversee the mishap investigation of the Starship / Super Heavy test mission. A return to flight of the Starship / Super Heavy vehicle is based on the FAA determining that any system, process, or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety. This is standard practice for all mishap investigations.\u201d Defining success for Starship Although it ended in an explosion, Thursday\u2019s test met several of the company\u2019s objectives for the vehicle. Clearing the launchpad was a major milestone for Starship. In the lead-up to liftoff, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk sought to temper expectations, saying, \u201cSuccess is not what should be expected. \u2026 That would be insane.\u201d \u201cWith a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today\u2019s test will help us improve Starship\u2019s reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multi-planetary,\u201d SpaceX tweeted after the explosion. Musk congratulated team members on \u201can exciting test launch\u201d in a post-launch tweet and said they \u201clearned a lot for next test launch in a few months.\u201d In a follow-up email to his employees, Musk added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to jinx it, but I think we are highly likely to reach orbit this year and recover the booster and ship, if not this year, certainly next year. Mars, here we come!\u201d   SpaceX will need a new launch license from the FAA to make another attempt, but the company does not expect the process to be as laborious as securing the license for Thursday\u2019s launch.  NASA Administrator Bill Nelson took to Twitter to share his congratulations on the flight test. \u201cEvery great achievement throughout history has demanded some level of calculated risk, because with great risk comes great reward. Looking forward to all that SpaceX learns, to the next flight test \u2014 and beyond.\u201d The test flight comes after years of explosive tests, regulatory hurdles and public hyping from Musk.  The company has been known to embrace fiery mishaps during the rocket development process. SpaceX maintains that such accidents are the quickest and most efficient way of gathering data, an approach that sets the company apart from its close partner NASA, which prefers slow, methodical testing over dramatic flare-ups. Musk has talked about Starship \u2014 making elaborate presentations about its design and purpose \u2014 for years, and he frequently harps on its potential for carrying cargo and humans to Mars, though NASA also plans to use the vehicle to put its astronauts on the moon. He\u2019s even said that his sole purpose for founding SpaceX was to develop a vehicle like Starship that could establish a human settlement on the Red Planet. Throngs of spectators lined local beaches to catch a glimpse of Starship\u2019s takeoff, bringing foldout chairs, children and dogs in tow. It echoed Monday\u2019s turnout for the company\u2019s first launch attempt, which was ultimately grounded as engineers worked to troubleshoot an issue with a valve on the Super Heavy booster.  In the area surrounding Starbase \u2014 SpaceX\u2019s name for the Starship development site on Texas\u2019 southernmost tip \u2014 many locals have greeted the rocket with enthusiasm. There are signs of Starship permeating the area: a model Starship in a front yard, a \u201cRocket Ranch\u201d camping ground filled with diehard enthusiasts, and a billboard advertising Martian beer.  What\u2019s next for Starship The test flight is a small step in a sweeping project. Before Starship can complete its first mission or host astronauts, SpaceX has significant technological questions to hash out. NASA has tapped SpaceX to provide a Starship lunar lander that would ferry astronauts from a separate spacecraft down to the moon\u2019s surface for the Artemis III mission, which is scheduled as early as 2025. Before that mission can take off, however, SpaceX has to prove that Starship can make it to the moon \u2014 much less Mars, which is Musk\u2019s ultimate ambition. The sheer mass of the vehicle will force the company to refuel the spacecraft while it\u2019s still in Earth\u2019s orbit. More than a dozen launches \u2014 carrying nothing but propellant \u2014 may be required to give a single Starship lunar lander enough fuel to traverse the 238,900-mile (384,500-kilometer) void between Earth and the moon. Before SpaceX can even hash out that process, it\u2019ll also need to put Starship into orbit in the first place. Thursday\u2019s test flight only sought to get to near orbital speeds and make a partial lap of the planet \u2014 an achievement that will have to wait for a future test. Even after flight tests begin to prove the vehicle\u2019s design, the Starship spacecraft must be fitted with all the necessary life support equipment astronauts will need for a journey to deep space. NASA was not involved in planning the flight profile for this test flight or directing SpaceX on what to do, according to Lisa Hammond, NASA\u2019s associate program manager of the Human Landing System at Johnson Space Center in Houston. In an interview earlier this month, Hammond did not share a specific checklist of tests or flights that NASA hopes to see before Starship is entrusted with a moon landing mission. \u201cI would not put it with a number,\u201d she said, adding that the Artemis II mission, slated for next year, will see humans fly atop the SLS rocket after only one uncrewed test flight. \u201cThe confidence comes in the design, the confidence comes in the safety of the vehicle for the crew,\u201d Hammond said. In addition to the Artemis III mission, Starship already has some ambitious projects on its manifest. SpaceX has sold a Starship-propelled tourism trip around the moon to Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa. The mission, dubbed \u201cDear Moon,\u201d plans to fly Maezawa and eight crewmates, including various artists from around the world. Most of the \u201cDear Moon\u201d crew was on the ground to witness Starship\u2019s first test flight. Karim Iliya, a photographer currently based in Iceland, described the experience of watching the flight attempt from a few miles away. \u201cThis wave of sound just smashed into my body, and I could feel it and I could hear it and I thought: Am I really going inside that machine? It was absolutely wild,\u201d Iliya told CNN. \u201cIt was just this feeling of joy and energy running through the crowd and through the people.\u201d Iliya added that the rocket explosion didn\u2019t give him any extra nerves for his future spaceflight. He understood he was watching a prototype take flight. But he experienced a \u201cfeeling of intensity\u201d visiting the rocket shortly after Monday\u2019s scrubbed launch attempt.  He said the Dear Moon crew was invited to get an up-close look at the rocket then. The vehicle was still venting. \u201cWe heard this very loud sound. Many of us \u2014 I think \u2014 we\u2019re ready to scramble,\u201d Iliya said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized how alive this machine is and how intense it is and will be when we actually strap ourselves in and leave the planet \u2014 which is in itself an absurd thought.\u201d What to know about this rocket Development of Starship has been based at SpaceX\u2019s privately held spaceport about 40 minutes outside Brownsville, Texas, on the US-Mexico border.  Testing began years ago with brief \u201chop tests\u201d of early spacecraft prototypes. The company started with brief flights that lifted a few dozen feet off the ground before evolving to high-altitude flights, most of which resulted in dramatic explosions as the company attempted to land the prototypes upright.  One suborbital flight test in May 2021, however, ended in success. Since then, SpaceX has also been working to get its Super Heavy booster prepared for flight. The gargantuan, 230-foot-tall (69-meter-tall) cylinder is packed with 33 of the company\u2019s Raptor engines.  Fully stacked, Starship and Super Heavy stand about 400 feet (120 meters) tall.",

            "title": "US airlines about to be hit with \u2018tsunami\u2019 of pilot retirements",
            "text": "The US airline industry is about to be hit with a \u201ctsunami of pilot retirements\u201d that will further the nation\u2019s pilot shortage, limiting flight availability for passengers and putting upward pressure on fares, an industry group told Congress Wednesday.   \u201cThe pilot shortage has resulted in a collapse in air service,\u201d Faye Malarkey Black, president and CEO of the Regional Airline Association, told a House Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee hearing in prepared remarks. More than half of pilots working today hit the mandatory retirement age of 65 in the next 15 years and younger pilots are not making up for those aging out.  The \u201csevere and ongoing pilot shortage\u201d is nationwide, Black noted: 42 states have less airline service now than before the pandemic, 136 airports have lost at least a quarter of their service, and airlines have completely cut off flights to 11 airports in smaller cities that connect to larger hubs. More than 500 planes belonging to regional airlines are sitting idle without enough pilots to fly them, and those that do fly are used as much as 40% less than in the past. Most airlines have yet to fully restore the service cuts they made during the pandemic, even in the face of record bookings at some carriers. That combination of limited capacity and strong demand is leading to fares that are significantly above pre-pandemic levels.   Black\u2019s group represents the regional carriers which provide feeder service for the larger airlines such as American, United \n            \n                (UAL)and Delta\n            \n                (DAL). Those major airlines are also facing shortages of pilots, but they\u2019ve been hiring pilots away from the regional carriers, causing an even worse problem for passengers and cities which depend on them. The large airlines hired more than 13,000 pilots in 2022, according to Black, nearly all from the smaller carriers that the RAA represents. More pilots earned licenses last year than ever before, but those 9,500 new entrants were not enough to keep pace with demand.  Black said the cost of training for a new pilot can be $80,000, with total costs reaching $200,000 when combined with the cost of a bachelor\u2019s degree. She said federal financial aid is insufficient to give poorer students a chance become pilots. \u201cUnlike other career paths that require additional professional credentialing, such as doctors and lawyers, accredited pilot training programs can\u2019t access additional lending available through graduate aid programs to cover the higher costs,\u201d she said in her prepared remarks. The demand for pilots will continue to grow, Black forecasts. Fewer than 8% of the pilot workforce are under the age of 30, and many are entering the cockpit as a second career.  \u201cThese pilots were long called to the career path but were only able to surmount the financial obstacles later in life after they had built up their own savings and credit histories,\u201d Black said in her prepared remarks. But the union representing most US airline pilots urged Congress against changing pilot qualification and training standards in an attempt to address the pilot shortage, saying some ideas would compromise safety.    \u201cThis is no time to weaken safety standards,\u201d Jason Ambrosi, President of the Air Line Pilots Association told the House Transportation subcommittee on aviation.    Thanks to requirements put in place after a series of airline crashes, \u201cpassenger fatalities have dropped by 99.8 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cThis pilot training framework has also produced tens of thousands more pilots over the last decade than airlines needed,\u201d Ambrosi said, pushing back on arguments from the Regional Airline Association and others in the industry that there are not enough qualified pilots.  \u201cThe United States has certificated nearly 64,000 airline transport pilots since July of 2013 while airlines have hired to fill approximately 40,000 positions,\u201d he added.      The Regional Airline Association, representing carriers that connect major cities to smaller regional airports, noted that the airlines are not the only destination for pilots with that qualification and warned of a significant pilot shortage that will get worse with a \u201ctsunami\u201d of retirements. Companies that fly business or charter planes are also hiring, RAA chief Black said.   But Ambrosi argued that the airlines are under-staffed right now because they are not providing pilots adequate pay and quality of life conditions, and because of management decisions made during the pandemic.   \u201cThe current labor market is complicated by pilots moving among carriers as they leave airlines that offer less attractive careers for those offering better pay and quality of life.\u201d  He also pushed back on arguments for raising the pilot retirement age.  A proposal to increase the mandatory retirement age by two years to 67 would cause airline scheduling headaches, he said. Senior airline pilots frequently fly international routes, but international rules have an age 65 limit. When pressed on other pilot positions, such as charter aircraft, allowing pilots to work until age 70, Ambrosi said he did not represent those workers.  The hearing also discussed a significant lack of diversity among pilots who tend to be mostly male and mostly white, and potential ways to address that issue, which could also help address any pilot shortages. There was a widely acknowledged shortage of pilots even before the pandemic. The airlines received billions of dollars of taxpayers\u2019 money during the pandemic, with a prohibition not to layoff staff, in an effort to make sure the shortage didn\u2019t get worse. But to save money, many airlines offered buyouts and early retirement packages to trim costs during the pandemic. The pandemic also interrupted the pipeline of new pilots.  \u2014 Chris Isidore contributed to this report",

            "text": "Air France and Airbus have been found not guilty of involuntary homicide in a criminal trial over the 2009 crash of a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris that killed 228 passengers and crew. The national carrier and plane manufacturing giant had been charged over their alleged role in the disaster after a previous investigation was dropped in 2019. \u201cLooking at the science at the time, no criminal liability seems to me to be applicable,\u201d one of the magistrates said, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. The acquittal was confirmed in an abstract of the court\u2019s ruling provided by the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office.  State prosecutors had taken the unusual step of admitting to the court that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to pin the blame on either company, BFMTV reported. \u201cThat is the part of the decision that we cannot \u2014 we do not \u2014 know how to be satisfied by, because nothing in our world, in our age, can justify that 228 people took a flight leaving Rio for Paris and never landed,\u201d David Koubbi, a lawyer representing some of the families of victims of the crash, told BFMTV. However, the court did find certain Airbus or Air France practices to be reckless or negligent. One issue is that Airbus did not replace faulty devices called pitot tubes, sensors crucial to determining an aircraft\u2019s speed and altitude. Problems with pitot tubes had affected Airbus aircraft in the past.  Air France, for its part, did not properly flag past reports of incidents with these tubes to pilots, according to the court. Both companies are now liable for civil damages as a result. A subsequent hearing has been set for September 4. Koubbi said these are not the claims for which his clients wanted compensation. The 2009 crash Mystery initially surrounded the crash of Air France flight 447, an A330, in part because it occurred while the plane was flying over the Atlantic Ocean. Most fatal aircraft accidents happen close to take-off or landing, not mid-flight. France\u2019s Bureau d\u2019Enqu\u00eates et d\u2019Analyses (BEA) concluded in 2012 that problems were first caused by icing on the pitot tubes. Once these sensors failed, the autopilot disengaged and the cockpit crew lost reliable readouts of flight data. The plane then plunged. Airbus retrofitted pitot tubes on aircrafts in 2019 following a directive from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. Had they been convicted, the companies would have each faced a fine of \u20ac225,000 ($245,629).  In a statement, Airbus said it \u201creaffirms the full commitment of the company and all its employees to keep prioritizing a safety-first culture across the company and the aviation sector.\u201d An Air France spokesperson said the company \u201cwishes to reaffirm its continued trust in all of its pilots and flight crews and reiterates that the safety of its customers and crews is its absolute priority.\u201d \u2014 Joseph Ataman, Chris Liakos and Jim Bitterman contributed reporting.",

            "text": "Just a few months after NASA introduced the world to the most powerful rocket ever flown to orbit, Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX is prepared to set off its own creation \u2014 which could pack nearly twice the power of anything flown before. SpaceX\u2019s vehicle, called Starship, is currently sitting on a launch pad at the company\u2019s facilities on the southern Texas coastline. The company is targeting liftoff at 8 a.m. CT (9 a.m. ET) on Monday, although it has the ability to take off anytime between 8 a.m. CT (9 a.m. ET) and 9:30 a.m. CT (10:30 a.m. ET). \u201cI guess I\u2019d like to just set expectations low,\u201d SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said during a Twitter \u201cSpaces\u201d event for his subscribers Sunday evening. \u201cIf we get far enough away from launch pad before something goes wrong, then I think I would consider that to be a success. Just don\u2019t blow up the pad.\u201d He added: \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that it gets postponed since we\u2019re going to be pretty careful about this launch.\u201d SpaceX has a livestream of the Starship launch here. Folks on the ground near SpaceX\u2019s facilities in South Texas can certainly catch an in-person glimpse. Locals are known to line the surrounding beaches in South Padre Island to watch tests, and this launch is sure to draw spectators. SpaceX has repeatedly warned those in the area, however, to stay away from the \u201cKeepout Zone\u201d \u2014 the areas directly surrounding the launch site that have been deemed too close to the rocket to be safe during lift off.  The \u201cKeepout Zone\u201d includes the coastline south of South Padre Island and stretches a few miles inland.  About this mission This will mark SpaceX\u2019s first attempt to launch a fully assembled Starship vehicle, building on a years-long testing campaign.  Musk has talked about Starship \u2014 making elaborate presentations about its design and purpose \u2014 for half a decade, and he frequently harps on its potential for carrying cargo and humans to Mars. Musk has even said that his sole purpose for founding SpaceX was to develop a vehicle like Starship that could establish a human settlement on Mars. Additionally, NASA has already awarded SpaceX contracts and options worth several billions of dollars to use Starship to ferry government astronauts to the surface of the moon under the space agency\u2019s Artemis program. The inaugural flight test will not complete a full orbit around Earth. If successful, however, it will travel about 150 miles above Earth\u2019s surface, well into altitudes deemed to be outer space.  Starship consists of two parts: the Super Heavy booster, a gargantuan rocket that houses 33 engines, and the Starship spacecraft, which sits atop the booster during launch and is designed to break away after the booster expends its fuel to finish the mission.  The massive Super Heavy rocket booster will give the first blast of power at liftoff. Less than three minutes after takeoff, it\u2019s expected to expend its fuel and separate from the Starship spacecraft, leaving the booster to be discarded in the ocean. The Starship will use its own six engines, blazing for more than six minutes, to propel itself to nearly orbital speeds.  The vehicle will then complete a partial lap of the planet, reentering the Earth\u2019s atmosphere near Hawaii. It\u2019s expected to splash down off the coast about an hour and a half after liftoff.  What\u2019s riding on this launch Starship\u2019s ultimate success or failure immensely consequential. Not only is it crucial to SpaceX\u2019s future as a company \u2014 it also underpins the United States government\u2019s ambitions for human exploration.  But it\u2019s not all riding on this inaugural test flight. SpaceX has long established its willingness to embrace mishaps, mistakes and explosions in the name of refining the design of its spacecraft.  In the lead-up to the first launch of the company\u2019s Falcon Heavy rocket in 2018, which held the title of most powerful rocket before NASA\u2019s SLS took flight last year, Musk foresaw only a 50-50 chance of success.  \u201cPeople (came) from all around the world to see what will either be a great rocket launch or the best fireworks display they\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Musk told CNN at the time.  The inaugural Falcon Heavy launch was ultimately successful.   Getting here Development of Starship has been based at SpaceX\u2019s privately held spaceport about 40 minutes outside Brownsville, Texas, on the US-Mexico border. Testing began years ago with brief \u201chop tests\u201d of early spacecraft prototypes. The company began with brief flights that lifted a few dozen feet off the ground before evolving to high-altitude flights, most of which resulted in dramatic explosions as the company attempted to land them upright.  One suborbital flight test in May 2021, however, ended in success. Since then, SpaceX has also been working to get its Super Heavy booster prepared for flight. The massive, 230-foot-tall (69-meter-tall) cylinder is packed with 33 of the company\u2019s Raptor engines.  Fully stacked, Starship and Super Heavy stand about 400 feet (120 meters) tall. SpaceX has been waiting more than a year to get FAA approval for this launch attempt. The company, and federal regulators tasked with certifying SpaceX launches won\u2019t pose risks to people or property in the area surrounding the launch site, have faced significant pushback from the local community, including from environmental groups. But the Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, announced Friday, April 14, that it granted the company\u2019s request for an uncrewed flight test of the rocket out of the SpaceX facilities in South Texas. \u201cAfter a comprehensive license evaluation process, the FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental, policy, payload, airspace integration and financial responsibility requirements,\u201d the agency said in a statement. During a call with reporters last week, an FAA official, who declined to be named for publication, said that the agency has been overseeing SpaceX\u2019s compliance with the mitigating actions, some of which are still in the works, even as the company prepares for launch. The FAA official said government personnel will be on the ground to ensure SpaceX complies with its license during the test launch. NASA and the future of Starship SpaceX\u2019s contract with NASA to use Starship for the space agency\u2019s Artemis III moon landing later this decade leaves much of Starship\u2019s development work to SpaceX. A $2.9 billion deal, inked in April 2021, was awarded to SpaceX over several competitors. It was later expanded to include a second lunar landing mission in 2027. NASA has been working over the past year to hash out a work flow between the space agency and SpaceX. It\u2019s a dynamic the two organization have had to iron out in previous SpaceX-NASA projects, including an ongoing partnership that uses SpaceX\u2019s Dragon spacecraft to get astronauts to and from the International Space Station. A moon mission, however, involves more powerful and complex hardware.  NASA is not, however, involved in planning the flight profile for this test flight or directing SpaceX on what to do, according to Lisa Hammond, NASA\u2019s associate program manager of the Human Landing System at Johnson Space Center in Houston.  Hammond did not share a specific checklist of tests or flights that NASA hopes to see before Starship is entrusted with a moon landing mission. \u201cI would not put it with a number,\u201d she said, adding that the Artemis II mission, slated for next year, will see humans fly atop the SLS rocket after only one uncrewed test flight.   \u201cThe confidence comes in the design, the confidence comes in the safety of the vehicle for the crew,\u201d Hammond said. SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell previously said she hopes the company will conduct more than 100 orbital test flights of Starship before putting humans on board, as the company will need to do in order to help NASA carry out its moon landing with the Artemis III mission, slated for 2025. \u201cI think that would be a great goal,\u201d Shotwell said Wednesday, when asked whether that target was still feasible. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will do 100 flights of Starship next year, but maybe (in) 2025 we will do 100 flights.\u201d NASA\u2019s current timeline targets 2025 for the first lunar landing mission, which will see astronauts transfer from their Orion capsule, which will launch atop a NASA Space Launch System rocket, and into a Starship spacecraft already in lunar orbit. It will be the Starship vehicle that ferries the crew down to the lunar surface.  It\u2019s not clear, however, if 2025 is feasible. NASA\u2019s inspector general has already suggested it is not. Delays, according to comments from the inspector general in March 2022, could revolve around Starship.",

The Starship spacecraft will complete nearly one full lap of the planet, ending its flight with a splashdown off Hawaii.  Getting here Development of Starship has been based at SpaceX\u2019s privately held spaceport about 40 minutes outside Brownsville, Texas, on the US-Mexico border. Testing began years ago with brief \u201chop tests\u201d of early spacecraft prototypes. The company began with brief flights that lifted a few dozen feet off the ground before evolving to high-altitude flights, most of which resulted in dramatic explosions as the company attempted to land them upright.  One suborbital flight test in May 2021, however, ended in success. Since then, SpaceX has also been working to get its Super Heavy booster prepared for flight. The massive, 230-foot-tall (69-meter-tall) cylinder is packed with 33 of the company\u2019s Raptor engines.  Fully stacked, Starship and Super Heavy stand about 400 feet (120 meters) tall. SpaceX has been waiting more than a year to get FAA approval for an orbital launch attempt. The company, and federal regulators tasked with certifying SpaceX launches won\u2019t pose risks to people or property in the area surrounding the launch site, have faced significant pushback from the local community, including from environmental groups. In June, the FAA granted SpaceX one key approval for launching Starship, though it laid out a list of \u201cmitigating actions\u201d the company would need to take before the first launch. During a call with reporters this week, an FAA official, who declined to be named for publication, said that the agency has been overseeing SpaceX\u2019s compliance with the mitigating actions, some of which are still in the works, even as the launch license is issued. The FAA official said government personnel will be on the ground to ensure SpaceX complies with its license during the test launch.",

            "text": "It\u2019s a bird\u2026 It\u2019s a plane\u2026 It\u2019s a paper airplane! The world record for the farthest flight by paper airplane has been broken by three aerospace engineers with a paper aircraft that flew a grand total of 289 feet, 9 inches (88 meters), nearly the length of an American football field. They beat the previous record of 252 feet, 7 inches (77 meters) achieved on April 2022 by a trio in South Korea. Prior to that, the record had not been broken in over a decade.  \u201cIt really put things on the map and it\u2019s a really proud moment for family and friends,\u201d said Dillon Ruble, a systems engineer at Boeing and now paper airplane record holder, in a release. \u201cIt\u2019s a good tie in to aerospace and thinking along the lines of designing and creating prototypes.\u201d  Ruble worked alongside Garrett Jensen, a strength engineer also with Boeing, and aerospace engineer Nathaniel Erickson. The trio are recent graduates who studied aerospace engineering and mechanical engineering at Missouri University of Science and Technology.  The feat required months of effort, as the team put in nearly 500 hours of studying origami and aerodynamics to create and test multiple prototypes. The engineers put their final design to the test on December 2, 2022, in Crown Point, Indiana, where the record was achieved on Ruble\u2019s third throw. \u201cWe hope this record stands for quite a while \u2014 290 feet (88 meters) is unreal,\u201d Jensen said in the release. \u201cThat\u2019s 14 to 15 feet (4.2 to 4.6 meters) over the farthest throw we ever did. It took a lot of planning and a lot of skill to beat the previous record.\u201d Paper plane physics The team had decided their best chance at beating the world record would be with an airplane design that focused on speed and minimized drag, so that the plane could fly a far distance in a short amount of time.  Gathering inspiration from various hypersonic aircrafts, vehicles that can fly faster than five times the speed of sound (Mach 5), specifically the NASA X-43A, the team had come up with the winning paper aircraft design \u2014 later named \u201cMach 5.\u201d \u201cFull-scale and paper airplanes have vast differences in their complexity, but both operate on the same fundamental principles,\u201d said Ruble, via email. \u201cSome of the same design methodologies can be applied to both. One of these methods was our trial-and-error design process. For instance, we would theorize about a fold we could change on our plane, fold it, throw it, and compare the distance to previous iterations to determine if the change was beneficial.\u201d   To find the best technique when it came to throwing the paper airplane, the team ran various simulations and analyzed slow-motion videos of their previous throws. \u201cWe found the optimal angle is about 40 degrees off the ground. Once you\u2019re aiming that high, you throw as hard as possible. That gives us our best distance,\u201d Jensen said in the statement. \u201cIt took simulations to figure that out. I didn\u2019t think we could get useful data from a simulation on a paper airplane. Turns out, we could.\u201d  Even down to the paper, which the team had decided that A4 (slightly longer than typical letter sized paper) was the best for manipulating and folding into the winning airplane. With these meticulously thought-out design choices, and careful attention to the numerous rules and guidelines set forth by the Guinness World Record Team, the three were set to break a record.   On its record-breaking distance flight the plane was in the air for roughly six seconds. The Guinness paper plane record for duration of flight is currently 29.2 seconds.  \u201cThe design objectives for an air-time record would be vastly different from the low-drag version we built for the longest-distance record,\u201d Ruble said via email. \u201cIncreasing the wingspan and decreasing the aspect ratio would be the first steps in producing this type of plane.\u201d  Paper airplane aside, Ruble added that this tedious method of back-and-forth trials served as a testament to the importance of rigorous prototyping in the real world. From origami enthusiasts to aerospace engineers Ruble and Jensen began their paper plane engineering careers while in middle school, participating in paper airplane events held at Boeing. Ruble said he enjoyed making the paper come to life and the hard work he had to put in to find ways to improve his designs. Both were also fans of origami as kids. The record-breaking team hopes their accomplishment will inspire other young and aspiring aerospace engineers to chase their dreams.  For those looking to create their own record-breaking paper plane design, the feat is not impossible, but may take some time (and skill). \u201cMach 5 flies best at high relative velocity, but to achieve this condition, the aircraft must be launched in a specific manner,\u201d said Ruble via email. \u201cThis technique, in addition to the complexity of the plane, means that only the most experienced paper aircraft enthusiasts would have success with the design. \u201cHowever, by starting with publicly available designs, anyone can hone their skills to throw paper airplanes farther and higher than all of their friends,\u201d he added.

Boeing\u2019s problems in the fourth quarter are tied to its difficult few years since the 737 Max crisis. For one, the company was saddled with excess inventory of hundreds of the jets. Usually Boeing doesn\u2019t hold onto inventory, as planes are delivered to customers soon after completion. But even though the 737 Max jets couldn\u2019t be delivered during the grounding, Boeing kept building them \u2014 partly to keep its suppliers in business. Then it was forced to find new buyers for some of those planes due to customers canceling orders during the pandemic.",

            "text": "The banking crisis caused by the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank has increased the odds of a US recession, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow in an exclusive interview on Thursday.  Speaking in his first interview since the failure of SVB, Dimon said that while the banking system is strong and sound, the recent turmoil around the financial system is \u201canother weight on the scale\u201d towards recession.  \u201cWe are seeing people reduce lending a little bit, cut back a little bit and pull back a little bit.\u201d While the banking chaos won\u2019t \u201cnecessarily force a recession,\u201d he said, \u201cit is recessionary.\u201d  There are storm clouds ahead for the economy, said Dimon. The Federal Reserve\u2019s current tightening regimen, plus higher, sticky inflation and Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine are the largest risks he sees for the economy. But Dimon said he does feel hopeful about the strength of human capital in the United States.  \u201cI\u2019m a red-blooded, full-throated, free-market, free-enterprise capitalist,\u201d said Dimon of supporting local entrepreneurship. \u201cI think we should applaud free enterprise and we should sing from the hills the benefits while we fix the negatives, as opposed to denigrate the whole thing.\u201d Dimon sat down with Harlow after the opening of Chase\u2019s Atlanta community branch. The Atlanta bank is Chase\u2019s 16th branch built in conjunction with local communities and which host free events, financial health workshops and skills training for locals. Community branches also provide storefront spaces for small business pop-ups.  Community banking  These branches, said Dimon, are not charity in any form. They\u2019re good for business. \u201cWe need to get money into local communities,\u201d he said. Part of that is as simple as opening a savings account. \u201cA lot of us had moms and dads who took us to open our first accounts,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you see your money go from like $84.75 to $85.17. It was like magic, that interest.\u201d Dimon said that is part of what he hopes to achieve with his community branches.  \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to be afraid to walk into a branch here. Come as you are, bring your kids and learn,\u201d he said.  As part of the initiative, Chase has hired a number of community managers with the express purpose of encouraging those who don\u2019t feel comfortable in a bank setting to come in and learn about their finances.  This role, he said, is essential and is often filled by regional, mid-sized community banks, which is partially why the recent failures of SVB and Signature and the possibility of contagion were so harrowing.  Banking sector meltdown Dimon said he isn\u2019t sure if the US economy is through the thick of the current banking crisis just yet.  \u201cI\u2019m hoping it will resolve, you know, rather shortly,\u201d he said.  Dimon said he doesn\u2019t know if more banks will fail this year, but was quick to point out that this turmoil is nothing like the financial crisis of 2008. In 2008, he said \u201cit was hundreds of institutions around the world with far too much leverage. We don\u2019t have that.\u201d  We don\u2019t have huge problems in our mortgage markets, either, he added. \u201cThis is nothing like that. And the American public shouldn\u2019t think that.\u201d Still, said Dimon, it\u2019s okay to let some banks collapse. \u201cFailure is okay,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just don\u2019t want this domino effect.\u201d Dimon warned that regional banks \u2014 and American consumers \u2014 should \u201cbe prepared for higher [interest] rates for longer. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to happen, but be prepared for that tide.\u201d  There\u2019s a good chance, he said, that rates remain higher for longer \u2014 and banks invested in Treasuries need to be prepared for that possibility.  Debt ceiling pain Lawmakers are growing more uneasy about raising the debt ceiling, the self-imposed $31.38 trillion borrowing limit they hit in January. Without new legislation, a default by the US government could come over the summer or in early September, according to various analyses. But talks between House Republicans and the White House remain stalled.  Dimon, who has worked closely with the White House and Congress this year on various economic problems, told Harlow that there would be no default under his watch. \u201cNot as long as I\u2019m alive. Boy, we\u2019re going to keep fighting this one\u201d he said.   Dimon said he believes Congress will come to a resolution on the debt ceiling within the next few months, but that there could be more economic pain to come before an agreement is made.  \u201cYou\u2019ll feel the pain before it happens,\u201d he said of breaching the debt ceiling. As a potential default comes closer \u201cyou\u2019ll see it in the markets and that will scare people,\u201d he said.  Still, \u201cWhen I go to Washington, most people there know how serious this is, and they want to get it to a resolution.\u201d  Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign Dimon served on former President Donald Trump\u2019s business council, and while he doesn\u2019t think that Trump\u2019s indictment and the criminal charges the former president faces this week will impact the economy, he does believe that Trump enacted some good economic policy. \u201cThere are policies that he did that are good,\u201d Dimon told Harlow. \u201cI think the tax reform actually brought a trillion dollars back to America. The Black community had the lowest unemployment rate ever in his last year because it grew the economy.\u201d That\u2019s not an endorsement, he was quick to add. \u201cThat\u2019s not supporting him. That\u2019s just saying that\u2019s true.\u201d Dimon also commented on another potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Last year, Florida passed legislation to limit discussions of LGBTQ issues in Florida schools, a bill that opponents referred to as the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law. Disney objected to the law and the state of Florida has since taken action to strip Disney of some of the powers it had over the land that includes and surrounds Disney World.  Those actions prompted Disney CEO Bob Iger to call DeSantis\u2019 actions, and the law \u201canti-business.\u201d Dimon on Thursday said that \u201cwe support the LGBT community aggressively and actively,\u201d and confirmed that he will continue to do so despite DeSantis.

            "text": "The sheared nose cone of the Antonov An-225 cargo plane towers over Yevhen Bashynsky.  Affectionately known as the Mriya, or \u201cDream,\u201d the leviathan plane was the pride of Ukraine and of 38-year-old Bashynsky, one of its pilots.   This is the first time Bashynsky has come back to see what remains of the Mriya.   \u201cIt is very hard to be here and to see all of this situation. Destroyed plane, destroyed hangars. It is quite hard to see,\u201d he says.  In the first hours of the war, elite Russian paratroopers descended on the Antonov airfield, a major cargo airport in Hostomel, to the northwest of Kyiv. It was supposed to be an anchor point to attack the capital. The assault did not go as planned. Russian troops inside the airport were encircled, with no chance to bring in reinforcements quickly.  Word soon got out in aviation circles that the Mriya had been damaged in the fighting. When Ukrainian forces retook the airport, the extent of the destruction became clear. The Security Service of Ukraine said Wednesday that a joint investigation had been launched with the national police into the failure of the former head of the state-owned Antonov company to order the aircraft\u2019s planned evacuation to safety in Germany.  When it flew, the Mriya was designed for aviation superlatives: the world\u2019s heaviest plane; the longest wingspan of any active carrier; six turbo fan engines with more than 50,000 pounds of thrust each; a carrying capacity of 250 tons. Only one was ever completed, first taking flight in 1988. It was designed to carry the Buran spacecraft \u2013 the Soviet Union\u2019s answer to NASA\u2019s Space Shuttle \u2013 on its back. But after Ukraine\u2019s independence, Antonov refurbished the plane several times.  In the early 2000s, Mriya began operating again as a commercial venture. From slow beginnings it found an important niche, says Antonov cargo division executive Ruslan Bykovets.   Satellites, electrical transformers, water delivery after a hurricane \u2013 the Ukrainian giant transported them all, he says. During the Covid-19 pandemic, it delivered vital medical cargo.    Bashynsky, the pilot, says that the plane was a challenge to maneuver on the ground, but it was a joy to fly \u2013 with a huge following from aviation enthusiasts.   \u201cYou know it was like feeling you are part of something great. You were touching something great,\u201d he says.   \u201cIt was also a great responsibility because you are attracting a lot of attention. A few days after you fly, you can open YouTube and see everything you have done.\u201d   In May last year, likely sensing the symbolic importance for his country, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine would rebuild the plane.  Antonov officials say another An-225 was partially built \u2013 but abandoned in the 1990s because of a lack of funds. The current plan is to use what they already have as the basis for a new plane. Engineers and technicians have been scouring the wreckage of the Mriya at Hostomel to pull out useful parts. They will eventually remove one of its giant wings to try to restore it, says Antonov designer Valerii Kostiuk.   \u201cThe aircraft will be equipped with modernized engines. New electronic on-board equipment will be installed on the plane. Well-known companies will be involved,\u201d he says.   Which companies those are and how Ukraine will afford to build the plane are not clear, or have not been disclosed by company officials. It is impossible to say exactly how much rebuilding the plane will cost, but some estimates put it close to a billion US dollars.  Antonov executive Bykovets understands that it won\u2019t be a top priority for a country shattered by war.   Still, he says, it should be done.   \u201cThis plane is a symbol of Ukraine,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a symbol like the Burj Khalifa or Statue of Liberty.\u201d ",

            "text": "Airbus announced plans Thursday for a second final-assembly line in China, the latest sign that it has a lock on the key aviation market over rival Boeing. The announcement came as part of a state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron to China. The signing of the agreement by Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury was witnessed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and by Macron.  It will add another line to the final-assembly facility that Airbus opened in Tianjin, China, in 2008, which has put the final touches on 600 A320 aircraft to date.  Airbus\n            \n                (EADSF) operates four assembly sites around the world but it forecasts that China\u2019s air traffic in particular will grow 5.3% annually over the next 20 years, significantly faster than the world average of 3.6%.  This will lead to a demand for 8,420 passenger and freighter aircraft between now and 2041, representing more than 20% of the world\u2019s total demand for new aircraft, Airbus predicts.  Boeing\n            \n                (BA) has similar forecasts for China\u2019s aircraft demand. Soured trade relations But worsening trade relations between the United States and China have basically locked Boeing out of that key market for aircraft. Thursday\u2019s deal includes the sale of another 160 Airbus aircraft to China, where more than 2,100 are in service already.  Boeing has not reported an order for a commercial passenger plane from a Chinese airline since 2017, only for orders from Chinese aircraft leasing companies that could be buying them on behalf of buyers outside of China, or for freighter aircraft, a segment of the market that Boeing dominates. And deliveries to Chinese customers by Boeing have plunged. So far this year it has delivered only one 777 freighter to China Air Cargo, and there were only 12 jets delivered in 2022: eight freighters and four to a leasing company. In 2017, the year the Trump administration first levied tariffs on US imports of Chinese goods, sparking a tit-for-tat trade tiff, Boeing delivered 161 jets to China, and slightly more in the following year. But with the 737 Max grounding and the pandemic causing a sharp fall off in demand for air travel, Boeing deliveries to China plunged to 45 in 2019, and to 27 in the three-plus years since then. Boeing\u2019s best selling plane, the 737 Max, which is a competitor to the A320 family that Airbus is finishing in China, has had trouble re-entering the Chinese market following a 20-month grounding that started in March of 2019 following two fatal crashes that killed a total of 346 people.  China was one of the last countries to allow the plane to fly in its airspace once again, and, even with that clearance, none of the Chinese customers of the plane have accepted deliveries of the 138 Boeing built for them during the grounding that are still sitting in the aircraft maker\u2019s inventory. Boeing has been forced to try to find other buyers for some of those aircraft at discounted prices. The 737 Max has been losing the competition with the A320 family outside of China as well, but it\u2019s not the total shutout that Boeing is experiencing in China. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun has said all Boeing can do is wait and hope for relations between the two countries to improve so it can again start making substantial sales and deliveries in China. \u201cMy hope is that these two big geopolitical forces get together and endorse free trade again \u2026  so that they can take more deliveries of airplanes,\u201d Calhoun told investors in October. \u201cBut it\u2019s really hard for me to find signals that things are going to change in China and move in our direction,\u201d he added. \u2014 Jake Kwon in Hong Kong contributed to this article.",

            "text": "The banking crisis triggered by the recent collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank is not over yet and will ripple through the economy for years to come, said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Tuesday.  In his closely watched annual letter to shareholders, the chief executive of America\u2019s largest bank outlined the extensive damage the financial system meltdown had on all banks \u2014 large and small \u2014 and urged lawmakers to think carefully before responding with increased regulation. \u201cThese failures were not good for banks of any size,\u201d wrote Dimon, responding to reports that large financial institution benefited greatly from the collapse of SVB and Signature Bank as wary customers sought safety by moving billions of dollars worth of money to big banks.  In a note last month, Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo wrote \u201cGoliath is winning.\u201d JPMorgan in particular, he said, was benefiting from more deposits \u201cin these less certain times.\u201d \u201cAny crisis that damages Americans\u2019 trust in their banks damages all banks \u2014 a fact that was known even before this crisis,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhile it is true that this bank crisis \u2018benefited\u2019 larger banks due to the inflow of deposits they received from smaller institutions, the notion that this meltdown was good for them in any way is absurd.\u201d  The failures of SVB and Signature Bank, he argued, had little to do with banks bypassing regulations. He said that SVB\u2019s high Interest rate exposure and large amount of uninsured deposits were already well-known to both regulators and to the marketplace at large.  Current regulations, he argued, could actually lull banks into complacency without actually addressing real system-wide banking issues. Abiding by these regulations, he wrote, has just \u201cbecome an enormous, mind-numbingly complex task about crossing t\u2019s and dotting i\u2019s.\u201d  And while regulatory change will almost certainly follow the recent banking crisis, Dimon argued that, \u201cit is extremely important that we avoid knee-jerk, whack-a-mole or politically motivated responses that often result in achieving the opposite of what people intended.\u201d Regulations, he said, are often put in place in one part of the framework but have adverse effects on other areas and just make things more complicated. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has said it will propose new rule changes in May, while the Federal Reserve is currently conducting an internal review to assess what changes should be made. Lawmakers in Congress, including Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, have suggested that new legislation meant to regulate banks is in the works.  But, wrote Dimon, \u201cthe debate should not always be about more or less regulation but about what mix of regulations will keep America\u2019s banking system the best in the world.\u201d",

            "text": "Alibaba\u2019s landmark restructuring has sent its shares soaring in New York and Hong Kong, as investors bet on the return of regulatory support for China\u2019s tech industry and private businesses after more than two years of a brutal crackdown. But the nature of the overhaul, in which the internet conglomerate will split its business into six separate units, is a sign that Beijing\u2019s campaign against Big Tech hasn\u2019t fundamentally changed. Regulators still intend to reduce the monopolistic nature of tech giants and limit their power, even as they urge private companies to do their part to create jobs and boost a flagging economy. The news of the restructuring came shortly after the return of co-founder Jack Ma to mainland China. Ma had been spending time overseas and otherwise keeping a low profile since the Chinese government began a fierce crackdown on the tech sector in late 2020. \u201cIt appears that Alibaba\u2019s break-up has been orchestrated by Beijing,\u201d said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Kaiyuan Capital.  \u201cThis idea is reinforced by Jack Ma\u2019s sudden reappearance, which now seems like a planned media event intended to boost market sentiment at a critical moment.\u201d  It worked. Shares in Alibaba\n            \n                (BABA), which has a market capitalization of $260 billion, soared 12% in Hong Kong on Wednesday, following a 14% surge on Wall Street overnight, leading the tech sector\u2019s gains in the Asia Pacific.  Ma is seen as a symbol of China\u2019s tech industry and a barometer of the Chinese government\u2019s support for private business. His presence is perceived as evidence of a more supportive approach to the private sector, at a time when China\u2019s economy badly needs growth.  In October 2020, the once high-profile entrepreneur criticized the country\u2019s financial regulatory system for being too rigid and unfriendly to small business. As a result, the authorities shelved Ant Group\u2019s planned $35 billion IPO at the last minute.  A sweeping regulatory crackdown on Big Tech followed, which later engulfed China\u2019s most powerful private companies, wiping huge sums off their market value. Alibaba\u2019s stock is still down 70% from its peak just days before regulators abruptly pulled the Ant Group IPO. Back in vogue But almost three years on, the dynamics have changed. The Chinese government is now facing significant economic challenges. It\u2019s eager to shore up growth and reinvigorate confidence in the tech sector following its emergence from three years of strict Covid-19 controls. Alibaba\u2019s restructuring is \u201cpart of [Beijing\u2019s] strategy to shore up confidence in the private sector,\u201d said Hong Hao, chief economist for Grow Investment Group. In a policy shift, Chinese leader Xi Jinping recently urged the government to support private businesses, while calling on entrepreneurs to play a role in boosting growth and tech innovation, so that China can better counter what he called \u201ccontainment\u201d and \u201csuppression\u201d from the West led by the United States.  Premier Li Qiang, a trusted ally of Xi who was confirmed as the country\u2019s No 2 official this month, followed up by rolling out a series of measures intended to repair ties between the government and the private sector. \u201cFor a period of time last year, there were some incorrect discussions and comments in the society, which made some private entrepreneurs feel worried,\u201d Premier Li said at his first news conference earlier this month.  Breaking up monopolies China may need Alibaba now, but it\u2019s not nearly as powerful as it was, according to analysts.   The breakup appears to \u201ccurb the influence of tech titans,\u201d Silvers said. \u201cIt would serve as a stark reminder of Beijing\u2019s uncomfortable relationship with the private sector, despite recent reassurances.\u201d Beijing\u2019s major concern is that private tech firms have become too big and powerful. During its years-long clampdowns, the government sought to reduce the monopolistic nature of many prominent tech companies, slapping them with big fines, banning apps from stores and demanding that some firms completely overhaul their businesses.  \u201c[Alibaba\u2019s restructuring plan] offers a way to limit monopoly power and platform sway,\u201d Hong said.  It could serve as a model for other Chinese tech giants going forward. \u201cTencent is the obvious [one] next,\u201d Hong said, adding that the social media and gaming giant has already started reducing its stake in portfolio companies, including food delivery company Meituan. Unlocking value Investors and analysts have cheered Alibaba\u2019s restructuring.  The move marks the most significant overhaul in the company\u2019s 24-year history and will \u201cunlock the value\u201d of its various businesses, it said on Tuesday. Alibaba\u2019s business will be split into six units: domestic e-commerce, international e-commerce, cloud computing, local services, logistics, and media and entertainment.  The domestic e-commerce group, which includes Taobao and contributes to a majority of the company\u2019s revenues, will remain a wholly-owned unit. The other five, meanwhile, will have their own CEOs and can pursue separate public listings. \u201cThe market is the best litmus test, and each business group and company can pursue independent fundraising and IPOs when they are ready,\u201d Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang said in an email to employees. Some analysts welcomed the move, believing it will lead investors to reassess the valuation of Alibaba.  Citi analysts said Tuesday their target price for Alibaba\u2019s US-listed stock was $156 per share, which is nearly 60% higher than Tuesday\u2019s closing level. -\u2014 CNN\u2019s Riley Zhang contributed reporting.",

Each new business unit will be overseen by its own chief executive and board of directors, the company said. Five of the new business groups \u201cwill also have the flexibility to raise outside capital and potentially to seek its own IPO,\u201d according to a company statement on Tuesday. The major restructuring at one of China\u2019s most iconic companies comes one day after Ma made a rare public appearance in the country and as Beijing has signaled that its regulatory pressure on the internet industry may be coming to an end. Ma, once an outspoken billionaire in the country, has kept a very low profile since the Chinese government began a fierce crackdown on the tech sector more than two years ago. In November 2020, Ant Group \u2014 a financial affiliate of Alibaba also founded by Ma \u2014 was forced to pull its $37 billion IPO at the last minute following a speech from Ma in which he criticized China\u2019s banks and financial regulators. The next year, Alibaba was hit with a record fine from China\u2019s antitrust regulators.  Alibaba\u2019s shares suffered a steep decline during that period, with the company losing roughly 75% of its market value between its peak in October 2020 and the same month two years later.  But this year, there has been a change in sentiment. Ant Group won a key approval for capital expansion of its consumer finance unit and China has broadly adopted a more business-friendly posture.  On Monday, Ma was seen meeting with students and teachers at the Alibaba-funded Yungu School in Hangzhou, where he visited and \u201cdiscussed the future of education with the campus directors,\u201d per post from the school on WeChat. Ma stepped down as CEO of Alibaba in 2013 and retired from his role as executive chairman in 2019.  With the shakeup, Alibaba appears to be taking a page from American tech companies like Google, which restructured as Alphabet. The goal, according to Alibaba, is to build more nimble companies that can ultimately unlock more value for investors.  \u201cThis transformation will empower all our businesses to become more agile, enhance decision-making, and enable faster responses to market changes,\u201d Daniel Zhang, CEO and chairman of Alibaba Group, said in an email to employees.  The six newly-formed business units will be: a Cloud Intelligence Group, Taobao Tmall Commerce Group, Local Services Group, Cainiao Smart Logistics, Global Digital Commerce Group, and a Digital Media and Entertainment Group.

            "text": "If someone were to ask you to draw the Pepsi logo from memory, what would you draw? A circle, perhaps, with the red, white and blue stripes that are emblematic of the brand. The word \u201cPepsi,\u201d probably, in that globe.   When PepsiCo walks people through this exercise, as it sometimes does, that\u2019s what most do: They put the word \u201cPepsi\u201d in the circle. But that\u2019s not how the current logo actually looks. The brand name is off to the side, a bit meek next to the iconic globe. So Pepsi is making a change.  \u201cWe couldn\u2019t ignore that kind of insight,\u201d Mauro Porcini, PepsiCo\u2019s chief design officer, told CNN. \u201cInstead of rejecting it, we decided to embrace it.\u201d  Pepsi on Tuesday unveiled a new logo and branding that will roll out in North America this fall and globally next year. It looks a lot like the 1990s version which seems to have stuck in people\u2019s brain, but with new elements to make it more modern, including a different font and font color and a new border. The changes are designed not only to better align with people\u2019s recollection, but to draw attention to Pepsi\u2019s zero sugar line \u2014 a key part of the company\u2019s growth plan.   \u2018Bold and confident\u2019  Pepsi has been around for 125 years, and updates its branding every so often. The current visual identity was introduced in 2008. But in the years since it first appeared, it\u2019s gone a bit stale.  The \u201cPepsi\u201d in the logo \u201cis decoupled from the globe,\u201d noted Todd Kaplan, Pepsi\u2019s chief marketing officer. \u201cIt\u2019s this lowercase, italicized font, the blue is a little bit muted \u2026 it doesn\u2019t exude that confidence and energy that the brand really represents.\u201d Pepsi, Kaplan said, is \u201ca bold and confident brand,\u201d one that stands for \u201cunapologetic enjoyment.\u201d The current logo, with its lower-case \u201cpepsi\u201d standing shyly away from that laid-back globe? Not very bold, not very confident.  The new logo, with its punchy, upper-case \u201cPEPSI\u201d smack-dab in the middle of the circle, emblazoned across the white stripe undulating between the red and blue waves, is more like it.   It\u2019s not unusual for companies to tweak their look to stay relevant, noted Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management. But they have to be careful not to rock the boat too much: Major changes risk confusing or upsetting customers. He pointed to the Tropicana logo debacle as an example. In 2009, Tropicana changed its carton design so drastically that consumers were outraged. Tropicana, then owned by PepsiCo, changed its logo back within a few months.  For \u201cbrands that have a long history, you always can look backwards,\u201d Calkins said. Tapping nostalgic images can be \u201cvery powerful.\u201d But companies have to be careful to make sure the legacy branding feels fresh, he said.  Pepsi says that the changes its making are distinctive enough to do the trick, and highlight modern elements like Pepsi\u2019s zero-sugar line.  Zero\u2019s the hero Soft drink companies have been focusing on zero-sugar products and branding in recent years as consumer interest in full-sugar soda flags, and PepsiCo is no exception.  Zero \u201cis going to be the center of the strategy for the Pepsi brand,\u201d in the US, PepsiCo\n            \n                (PEP) CEO Ramon Laguarta said during a February analyst call. Earlier this year, Pepsi announced changes to its zero-sugar recipe, and advertised the product with a Super Bowl commercial.   \u201cWe think that the non-sugar segment of colas will continue to grow very fast in this country. We\u2019re seeing consumers pivoting,\u201d Laguarta said, noting that zero had already been a \u201cstrategic\u201d product in Europe and elsewhere.   To that end, \u201czero sugar is going to be the protagonist of our communication strategy,\u201d Porcini told CNN.  To highlight the zero line, the new logo uses black font and a black border, a nod to Pepsi Zero\u2019s black can and label. The border also helps make the logo the defined center of the company\u2019s new pulse campaign, which features lines radiating out of the pulsing logo in time with upbeat music in video ads and elsewhere.  The team knows that even small changes can make waves with consumers and approached the update with caution.   \u201cThis has been a iterative process over the last handful of years,\u201d said Kaplan. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a really great way to maintain [Pepsi\u2019s] familiarity \u2026 but also project out to the future.\u201d",

            "text": "Dozens of American companies are in Vietnam this week in hopes of pushing further into the fast-growing Southeast Asian economy, which has emerged as an attractive potential alternative to China as companies seek to diversify their markets and supply chains. Senior executives from 52 US firms are taking part in the biggest business mission ever organized by the US-ASEAN Business Council, the trade lobby told CNN. The trip, held annually and currently led by former US Ambassador to Vietnam Ted Osius, began Tuesday and runs to Thursday. The council did not specify who was attending, but corporate heavyweights Boeing\n            \n                (BA) and Netflix\n            \n                (NFLX) confirmed they had joined the delegation. Boeing\u2019s president for Southeast Asia and managing director for Vietnam are representing the aerospace giant and expected to meet with government officials, the company said in a statement to CNN. The discussions \u201cwill focus on Boeing\u2019s growing partnership with Vietnam and ways to strengthen the country\u2019s aviation and defense capabilities,\u201d it added.  \u201cBoeing has been developing its presence in Vietnam by investing in local capability building and collaborating with Vietnamese organizations across manufacturing, infrastructure, engineering services, aviation safety, sustainability, research and technology, training, and skills development,\u201d the statement said. Netflix declined to comment further. But according to a person familiar with the matter, the media giant is examining how to comply with a new regulation that requires overseas media companies to register for a business license from Vietnam in order to provide streaming services there.  The firm hopes to have more clarity on the rule, which is called Decree 71 and took effect in January, following the trip, the person added. Netflix\u2019s streaming service is available to viewers in Vietnam, though it does not have a direct presence there. That may soon change. Citing unidentified sources, Reuters reported last month that the company was planning to open its first office in the country. Netflix declined to comment. The blitz by US companies this week underscores how Vietnam has emerged as an attractive destination for foreign businesses, as its rapid economic growth and rising middle class continue to lure investors. The country\u2019s GDP expanded by 8% last year, defying a broader global economic slowdown. But the nation of more than 97 million is also facing heightened risks due to the continued effects of the slowdown. As one of the world\u2019s most trade-dependent economies, Vietnam would be among those \u201chardest hit by further weakness in global demand\u201d for exports this year, according to Capital Economics. In a recent note, Oxford Economics predicted the country\u2019s GDP growth would slow to 4.2% in 2023, citing \u201ca weak outlook in its global trading partners and rising financial risks.\u201d",

            "text": "The skies have been turbulent over the United States in 2023 \u2013 and not just because of rogue balloons.  Since the start of the year, there have been a concerning number of high-profile \u201cnear misses\u201d as planes involved in airport landing or taking off procedures came perilously close to potential disaster.  And then there\u2019s the turbulence. As all flyers know, bumpy air is a regular feature of plane travel, but not usually, as has been experienced recently, to the violent extent that passengers are hurt. Plus, details emerged of an incident late last year, in which a United Airlines Boeing 777 plunged toward the Pacific Ocean for 21 seconds just after takeoff, apparently pulling up just 800 feet over the Pacific Ocean as passengers screamed in fear. The litany of incidents that have clocked up less than three months into 2023 have prompted such concern that this week the US Federal Aviation Administration convened a \u201cSafety Summit.\u201d Of course, flying remains an incredibly safe way to travel. Commercial plane crashes are nowadays very rare, with approximately 45,000 flights typically completed each day in the US, all without fatality. That\u2019s a number that continues to rise, post Covid. So, given that the FAA has assembled aviation experts \u2013 and US Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg \u2013 to take a closer look at what\u2019s going on in the US, should passengers be worried? While officials, still investigating these incidents, and airlines say flyers can continue to board planes with the confidence that the industry\u2019s rigorous safety procedures will keep them out of harm\u2019s way, some say recent events are a warning sign of potential trouble to come.  \u201cThese recent incidents must serve as a wake-up call for every single one of us, before something more catastrophic occurs. Before lives are lost,\u201d National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said to government and industry leaders gathered for the summit on Wednesday.  A string of scary near misses On paper, it has not been a great year, thanks mainly to the series of headline-making \u201crunway incursions\u201d \u2013 essentially near misses between aircraft that made headlines and prompted serious questions about aviation risks. On January 13, an American Airlines jet crossed a runway at New York\u2019s JFK International Airport as a Delta Air Lines aircraft was taking off. Ten days later, a United Airlines jet crossed a runway at Honolulu\u2019s Daniel K. Inouye International Airport as a cargo aircraft was coming in to land. At their closest, says the FAA, the two were 1,170 feet apart. February saw a rash of incidents. At California\u2019s Burbank Airport, a Mesa Airlines plane had to make a go-around \u2013 essentially an aborted landing \u2013 when its crew realized a SkyWest plane was taking off from the same runway. Another go-around incident occurred at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport in Florida. Perhaps closest to disaster was an incident on February 4, when FedEx cargo pilots were landing at Austin, only to see a Southwest plane was on the runway, about to take off.  Air Traffic Control had cleared both planes, despite the airport being wreathed in fog. The aircraft came within 100 feet of each other. In late February, air traffic controllers at Boston averted a crash when a Learjet took off without clearance as a Jetblue flight was coming in to land on an intersecting runway. The JetBlue aircraft \u201ctook evasive action and initiated a climb-out,\u201d according to an FAA statement. The National Transportation Safety Board, which looks into incidents, is now investigating all six events. It is also investigating a December incident, in which a United Airlines Boeing 777 jet departing from Hawaii plunged towards the ocean after takeoff, coming within 775 feet of sea level. The FAA, which is also investigating the recent spate of incidents, says it has not found a common cause. It seems like stories like this are becoming increasingly common. Or are they?  Most incursions are not serious Data from the FAA published in 2017 showed that reports of runway incursions have been on a largely upward trend since 1997, and steadily rising since 2011. The Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST), formed in 1997, encouraged a culture of data sharing and no-blame safety reporting. The number of accidents has remained relatively constant, according to FAA analysis through 2016, and it shows the cumulative risk trending down. The FAA says most incursions are not classed as serious \u2013 few of the 120 or so logged in January 2023 have made headlines. That figure includes all incursions, including those involving general aviation aircraft. Some, however, can sound terrifying.  These include an event on January 18, in which a Boeing 737 took off from Dallas Love Field without ATC authorization; fortunately no other traffic was involved. And another at Florida\u2019s Treasure Coast International, when a fire truck entered the runway as a business jet was taking off.   The latter is deemed \u201ccategory A\u201d \u2013 the most serious of runway incursions, \u201cin which a collision is narrowly avoided,\u201d according to the FAA. And there\u2019s been a recent uptick in those cases. Both 2022 and 2021 saw seven of them \u2013 up on three in 2019 and four in 2018, according to the FAA\u2019s runway incursion database. However, there were 22 category A incidents in 2007, the sharpest peak in the past two decades. Most of the incursions involving commercial airliners that have made headlines this year are not yet entered into the FAA database. The agency did not provide specifics about how those incidents will be categorized.  \u201cThe vast majority of runway incursions are not serious occurrences,\u201d the FAA said in a statement. \u201cHowever, reducing the risk of them occurring remains one of the FAA\u2019s highest safety priorities and is a shared responsibility that encompasses pilots, air traffic controllers and airport vehicle drivers.\u201d  While incident numbers might not be on a dramatically upward trajectory, they are causing alarm. In February, acting FAA administrator Billy Nolen sent a memo to the agency instructing staff to \u201cstare into the data and ask hard questions.\u201d  Nolen renewed that call at the summit on Wednesday.  Among the questions he posed for consideration by the assembled experts: \u201cIn light of these recent close calls and the attention being focused on even the most routine of go-arounds, are we emphasizing efficiency over safety? How much of what we see can be attributed to the sudden resurgence in demand following the pandemic?\u201d He said that over the past 25 years the industry has made \u201cenormous strides\u201d in its ability to scour data and identify risks before they manifest into serious incidents or accidents, but he called on members of the aviation industry to discuss \u201cconcrete steps\u201d to make the system safer. \u201cAmerica\u2019s aviation safety net is strong, our goal, our obligation, is to sew those threads even tighter,\u201d Nolen said. System under pressure It\u2019s about time, say some who work in the aviation industry amid fear that cuts made during the pandemic, plus a lack of scrutiny, have compromised America\u2019s long safety culture in aviation. The United States\u2019 last fatal accident was in 2009, when Colgan Air flight 3407 crashed while flying from Newark to Buffalo, killing everyone onboard.  The NTSB investigation declared it to be pilot error, citing pilot fatigue as a factor.  The FAA revised duty times for pilots as a result, cutting them to a maximum of 14 hours, down from 16, including eight hours of flying. Minimum rest times rose from eight to 10 hours. Cargo pilots can work slightly longer hours, despite sharing the runways with commercial pilots.  And whereas previously airlines have stayed well within them, some are now asking pilots to work closer to the maximums. Dennis Tajer, an American Airlines captain and spokesperson for the Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents 15,000 AA pilots, says that, since the pandemic started, the pressure on pilots is at an all-time high. The union is in ongoing negotiations with the airline. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the system under pressure for well over a year, it was just a question of time before it was going to manifest itself in incidents,\u201d he says. \u201cThankfully there\u2019ve been no accidents \u2013 yet.\u201d  Pilot fatigue and shortages Tajer cites a shortage of pilots caused by Covid lockdown layoffs as part of the problem. Last May, United CEO Scott Kirby said that there \u201csimply aren\u2019t enough pilots.\u201d  A February 2023 analysis by management consultancy Oliver Wyman estimated a \u201csupply gap\u201d of 18% of the US pilot workforce.  As a result, airlines have increased pilot hours \u2013 to within legal levels allowed by the FAA, but surpassing pre-pandemic schedules, says Tajer.  \u201cWe are exhausted. Fatigue doesn\u2019t happen in a moment \u2013 it can be chronic and that can affect your next flight. It\u2019s like running an engine at its maximum all the time. At first it looks good, but over time things start to crack and leak. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing now.\u201d  At the same time, he says, airlines are cutting back on training. In 2020, AA switched from retraining pilots every nine months, as it had done previously, to every 12 months \u2013 the FAA minimum standard. AA said any changes were in line with FAA rules and followed a thorough risk assessment. \u201cSafety is the foundation of every decision we make at American, and is the north star of our Flight Training program,\u201d it said in a statement to CNN. \u201cWe have the best, most expertly trained pilots in the business who are unwavering in their mission of operating a safe airline for our customers and fellow team members.\u201d  Staffing \u2013 of positions including pilots, air traffic controllers and ground crew \u2013 was frequently cited as a pressure point among industry leaders at the summit. As was the importance of adequate training for both those who are new and those who are returning after absences brought on by the pandemic. The loss of experienced workers was also a key concern. \u201cWith about half of our nation\u2019s qualified pilots facing their mandatory retirement within 15 years, we are going to be training and hiring tens of thousands of new pilots over the next two decades,\u201d said Faye Malarkey Black, president and CEO of the Regional Airline Association.  \u201cAnd it is extremely, extremely important when we\u2019re doing this that we focus on building the right foundation from the start.\u201d Nicholas Calio, president and CEO of trade group Airlines for America, said US carriers have hired 100,000 new workers with a strong emphasis on training.   \u2018A job that requires colossal concentration\u2019 Terry Tozer, a British former airline pilot and author who now comments on safety, sees systematic issues with US aviation protocols. \u201cAmerica is a very aviation-orientated country,\u201d he says. \u201c[Airports] pack a lot of traffic in\u2026 and if you put everyone under pressure, a cock-up [mistake] is more likely.\u201d In particular, \u201cthe American air traffic control system is very pressurized,\u201d he says, pointing out that in the UK and the European Union, air traffic control workers get longer downtime. \u201cCovid seems to have exacerbated the situation \u2013 there\u2019s an issue with staffing levels, and that usually adds pressure on the people at the coalface. It\u2019s a job that requires colossal concentration.\u201d FAA regulations state that air traffic controllers can work no more than 10 hours a day (including two hours overtime), and get regular breaks.  Last summer, Airlines for America claimed the East Coast network was \u201ccrippled\u201d due to lack of ATC staff.  \u201cUnfortunately, we have a staffing issue right now as air traffic controllers. We are 1,200 certified professional controllers less now than we were 10 years ago,\u201d Rich Santa, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said at the summit.  Nolen said the FAA is on pace to hire 1,500 controllers this year and 1,800 next year. Tozer says that when he flew to the US, he\u2019d feel \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d because of the way ATC in America clears aircraft to land when there will often still be a plane on the runway, about to take off. \u201cIn the UK and most of Europe, you won\u2019t get a landing clearance from ATC until the runway ahead is clear. [In the US] they work on the assumption [pilots] will do as they\u2019re told once they\u2019re cleared to take off.\u201d  A spokesperson for the FAA told CNN that it continually evaluates procedures and that \u201cline-up-and-wait procedures\u201d were safeguarded either by technology or strict rules on visibility. They said \u201cextensive safety data\u201d enables spot risks to be identified and issues resolved before accidents occur As both pilots point out, the good news is that all we\u2019ve seen so far are incidents, not accidents. \u201cSo you could argue that the system works,\u201d says Tozer. \u201cBut the safety margins have been eroded a little.\u201d",

            "title": "Baidu stock rebounds after falling sharply in wake of ChatGPT-style bot demo",
            "text": "Shares in Chinese search giant Baidu rebounded sharply a day after it unveiled ERNIE Bot, its answer to the ChatGPT craze. Its stock soared 14.3% on Friday in Hong Kong, making it the biggest winner in the Hang Seng Index\n            \n                (HSI). They also gained 3.8% in New York during US trade Thursday.  A day earlier, Baidu\n            \n                (BIDU) was the biggest loser of the same index. Its Hong Kong shares fell 6.4% after a public demonstration of its bot failed to impress investors. Since February, more than 650 companies had joined the ERNIE ecosystem, CEO Robin Li said during the presentation. The reversal came after the company said more than 30,000 businesses had signed up to test out its chatbot service within two hours of its demonstration. \u201cThe high degree of enterprise interest is positive, and we expect Baidu to continue to capture China\u2019s enterprise demand for generative AI,\u201d Esme Pau, Macquarie\u2019s head of China and Hong Kong internet and digital assets, told CNN. She said the company\u2019s shares were bouncing back Friday as some users, including analysts, shared positive feedback of their own experiences trying out ERNIE, which suggested the bot had more advanced capabilities.  High hopes During the presentation, Baidu showed how its chatbot could generate a company newsletter, come up with a corporate slogan and solve a math riddle. But its stock slumped on Thursday because the demo was \u201cpre-recorded, and not live, which makes investors skeptical about the robustness of the ERNIE Bot,\u201d according to Pau. Baidu\u2019s demonstration also came just days after the launch of GPT-4, which \u201craised the bar for ERNIE,\u201d she added. GPT-4 is the latest version of the artificial intelligence technology behind ChatGPT. The service has impressed users this week with its ability to simplify coding, rapidly create a website from a simple sketch and pass exams with high marks. Pau noted that Baidu\u2019s shares were already \u201cdown modestly\u201d before showing off its software on Thursday, highlighting pressure from investors who had raised expectations following the GPT-4 launch. \u201cERNIE also does not have the [same] multilingual capability as GPT-4, and has yet to improve for English queries,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, the ERNIE launch did not provide sufficient quantifiable metrics compared to the GPT-4 launch earlier this week.\u201d Like ChatGPT, ERNIE is based on a language model, which is trained on vast troves of data online in order to generate compelling responses to user prompts. Li said Baidu\u2019s expectations for ERNIE were \u201cclose to ChatGPT, or even GPT-4.\u201d But he acknowledged the software was \u201cnot perfect yet,\u201d adding it was being launched first to enterprise users. The service is not yet available to the public.  Competition heating up Baidu announced its chatbot last month. Some critics say the service will add fuel to an existing US-China rivalry in emerging technologies. Li tried to shake off that comparison during the launch, saying the bot \u201cis not a tool for the confrontation between China and the United States in science and technology, but a product of generations of Baidu technicians chasing the dream of changing the world with technology.\u201d  \u201cIt is a brand new platform for us to serve hundreds of millions of users and empower thousands of industries,\u201d he said.  Baidu says its service stands out because of its advanced grasp of Chinese queries, as well as its ability to generate different types of responses. \u201cERNIE Bot can produce text, images, audio and video given a text prompt, and is even capable of delivering voice in several local dialects such as the Sichuan dialect,\u201d the company said in a statement.  By comparison, GPT-4 is also able to analyze photos, but currently only generates text responses, according to its developer, OpenAI. Baidu isn\u2019t the only Chinese firm working on such technology. Last month, Alibaba\n            \n                (BABA) announced plans to launch its own ChatGPT-style tool, adding to the list of tech giants jumping on the chatbot bandwagon. So far, Baidu has a first mover advantage in the space in China, according to analysts.  \u201cOur view is ERNIE is three to six months ahead of its potential contenders,\u201d said Pau. Baidu also announced a milestone in its transportation business on Friday, saying it is the first operator in Beijing to be allowed to provide fully driverless ride-hailing services in the city. The company isn\u2019t allowed to start charging passengers in the capital for the new service yet. Previously, it was required to keep a driver in the front passenger seat to take over in case of emergencies.  Baidu runs fully driverless commercial taxi services in the cities of Chongqing and Wuhan. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Mengchen Zhang contributed to this report.",

            "text": "Polish pilot Lukasz Czepiela made aviation history on Tuesday, becoming the first person to land a plane on the helipad of the iconic Burj Al Arab Jumeirah hotel in Dubai. Czepiela was able to bring his specially adapted light aircraft to a stop in just 21 meters (68 feet), landing on a platform only 27 meters (89 feet) wide, 212 meters (696 feet) above the ground on top of the 56-story building. \u201cThe biggest challenge was the lack of any external points of reference, which is usually found at an airport where you have hundreds of meters of runway,\u201d he told sponsors Red Bull.    The stunt had been in the planning since 2021 and required 650 test landings, according to Red Bull. Czepiela\u2019s day job is captaining an Airbus A320, but he has some impressive flying achievements under his belt, including winning the 2018 world championship challenger class title in the Red Bull Air Race, and landing an aircraft on a wooden pier in Sopot, Poland.  Czepiela joins an elite group of sporting legends who have graced the helipad of the sail-shaped hotel, including tennis champions Roger Federer and Andre Agassi, who played a match there in 2005, and former F1 Grand Prix winner David Coulthard, who performed donuts there in 2013.

            "text": "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin vowed on Wednesday that US aircraft will continue to \u201cfly and to operate wherever international law allows,\u201d one day after Russian aircraft hit a US drone over the Black Sea, forcing it to be brought down in international waters.   \u201cThis hazardous episode is part of a pattern of aggressive, and risky, and unsafe actions in international airspace,\u201d Austin said at the beginning of a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. \u201cSo make no mistake, the United States will continue to fly and to operate wherever international law allows. And it is incumbent upon Russia to operate as military aircraft in a safe and professional manner.\u201d  Austin was the first Cabinet member in the Biden administration to directly address the incident, which happened on Tuesday when two Russian Su-27 aircraft intercepted a US MQ-9 Reaper drone. President Joe Biden was briefed on the incident by national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Tuesday.  Austin confirmed on Wednesday at a Pentagon news briefing that he had spoken to his Russian counterpart, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, adding that it was critical \u201cgreat powers be models of transparency and communication.\u201d The downing of the drone marked the first time Russian and US military aircraft have come into direct physical contact since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine a year ago. On Wednesday, a Kremlin spokesperson said that relations between Moscow and Washington are at their \u201clowest point.\u201d However, the US has not yet announced it is taking any action against Russia over the incident, suggesting the Biden administration may be looking to avoid escalating matters further. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said Wednesday at the news briefing that the US does \u201cnot seek armed conflict with Russia, and I believe that at this point, we should investigate this incident and move on from there.\u201d The Russian aircraft, Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said Tuesday, flew in the vicinity of the drone for 30 to 40 minutes before one of the aircraft hit the MQ-9, resulting in the US bringing the drone down into the water.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking at a news conference later Wednesday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, declined to speculate as to a Russian motive behind the incident but called it a \u201creckless and unsafe action.\u201d Senior Russian defense officials approved harassment of US drone, sources say Two US officials familiar with the intelligence told CNN that senior officials at the Russian Ministry of Defense gave the order for the Russian fighter jets to harass the US drone, suggesting that the pilots were not taking rogue action when they interfered with the US drone. At this time, however, there is no indication that the highest of political leaders in Russia \u2013 particularly those in the Kremlin, including President Vladimir Putin \u2013 knew about the planned aggression in advance, one of the US officials said. State Department spokesperson Ned Price indicated Wednesday night that there was likely high-level approval of the harassment. \u201cOur aircraft, our drones have been harassed by Russian pilots almost consistently. And to say that that consistent pattern is the consequence of pilots doing this, Russian pilots doing this on their own volition, that just didn\u2019t ring true,\u201d Price told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on \u201cAC360.\u201d \u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve seen a pattern on the part of the forces of the Russian Federation suggests to us at least there\u2019s at least some senior level approval of this kind of activity.\u201d Whether the military officials set out to plan an incident where the fighter jets would come into physical contact with the drone remains unclear.   \u201cWe know that the intercept was intentional. We know that the aggressive behavior was intentional, and we also know it was very unprofessional and very unsafe,\u201d Milley said at the briefing. \u201cThe actual contact of the fixed-wing Russian fighter with our UAV, the physical contact with those two, not sure yet.\u201d Russia says it will attempt to retrieve drone wreckage National Security Council communications coordinator John Kirby told \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d earlier Wednesday that the drone had not been recovered and that he was \u201cnot sure\u201d the US would be able to recover it. He previously told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that the US took steps \u201cto protect our equities with respect to that particular drone.\u201d The US erased sensitive software on the drone remotely before it crashed to prevent Russia from collecting secret information, two US officials told CNN.  Russia had reached the MQ-9 crash site in the Black Sea, two officials told CNN Wednesday, as the Kremlin promises to attempt to recover the US surveillance drone. Kirby would not confirm that Russians had reached the site but told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d that the US had \u201cmade it impossible for them to be able to glean anything of intelligence value off the remnants of that drone, whatever remnants there might be on the surface of the water.\u201d Russia made clear earlier Wednesday it would attempt to retrieve the wreckage of the drone. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we will be able to get it or not, but we need to do it\u2026 And we will definitely look into it,\u201d Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said on Russian state TV channel Rossiya 1. Russia\u2019s Navy has several ships in the Black Sea, including ships based in Crimean ports, which would have placed them in an advantageous position to attempt the recovery. The US does not have any Navy ships in the Black Sea, according to a Navy official, which would make any attempted US recovery effort extremely difficult and time-consuming. Milley confirmed on Wednesday that the US does not have any ships in the Black Sea but said the US does \u201chave a lot of allies and friends in the area.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019ll work through recovery operations, that\u2019s US property, and we\u2019ll leave it at that at this point,\u201d Milley said. He added that the drone \u201cprobably broke up\u201d and there was \u201cprobably not a lot to recover.\u201d  \u201cAs far as the loss of anything of sensitive intelligence etc, as normal we would take \u2014 and we did take \u2014 mitigating measures,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we are quite confident that whatever was of value is no longer of value.\u201d The mid-air encounter occurred approximately 45 miles southwest of the Crimean peninsula, one of the US officials said. The MQ-9 landed approximately 70 miles southwest of Crimea after gliding away from the occupied territory, the official added.  Russia has denied the US\u2019 account of the incident, with Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov saying Tuesday that Russia had \u201cinformed about this space that was identified as a zone for special military operation.\u201d Antonov also said that the MQ-9 \u201cflew with its transponders off, violating the boundaries of the temporary airspace,\u201d and that Russian aircraft did not come into contact with it. Milley said Wednesday that while he did not know whether the physical contact between the aircraft and drone was intentional, the intercept and \u201caggressive behavior was intentional.\u201d  The Kremlin continued its defense on Wednesday, with spokesperson Dmitry Peskov telling reporters to focus on the ministry of defense\u2019s statement, \u201cwhich clearly states that no weapons were used, and there was no physical contact.\u201d  Peskov said relations between the US and Russia are in a \u201cdeplorable state\u201d and at their \u201clowest point,\u201d adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin was briefed on the incident.  Milley said he has a call scheduled soon with the Chief of Russian General Staff, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, by telephone on Wednesday. The two military leaders have not spoken since late-December.       Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defence Council, described the incident as a \u201csignal\u201d of Putin\u2019s \u201creadiness to expand the conflict zone with the involvement of other parties.\u201d \u201cThe incident with the American MQ-9 Reaper UAV, provoked by [R]ussia in the Black Sea, is [P]utin\u2019s signal of readiness to expand the conflict zone with the involvement of other parties,\u201d he said. \u201cThe all-in tactic is the constant raising of rates in conditions of a strategic loss and hoping that circumstances would change.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.",

            "text": "A Russian fighter jet forced down a US Air Force drone over the Black Sea on Tuesday after damaging the propeller of the American MQ-9 Reaper drone, according to the US military.   The Reaper drone and two Russian Su-27 aircraft were flying over international waters over the Black Sea on Tuesday when one of the Russian jets intentionally flew in front of and dumped fuel on the unmanned drone several times, a statement from US European Command said.  The aircraft then hit the propeller of the drone, prompting US forces to bring the MQ-9 drone down in international waters. Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder added Tuesday that the Russian aircraft flew \u201cin the vicinity\u201d of the drone for 30 to 40 minutes before colliding just after 7 a.m. Central European Time. \u201cOur MQ-9 aircraft was conducting routine operations in international airspace when it was intercepted and hit by a Russian aircraft, resulting in a crash and complete loss of the MQ-9,\u201d Air Force Gen. James B. Hecker, commander of US Air Forces Europe and Air Forces Africa, said in the statement. \u201cIn fact, this unsafe and unprofessional act by the Russians nearly caused both aircraft to crash.\u201d The incident marks the first time Russian and US military aircraft have come into direct physical contact since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine just over a year ago and is likely to increase tensions between the two nations, with US calling Russia\u2019s actions \u201creckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional.\u201d Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said that Russia does not want \u201cconfrontation\u201d between his country and the US after he was summoned to the State Department following the downing of the drone. \u201cWe prefer not to create a situation where we can face unintended clashes or unintended incidents between the Russian Federation and the United States,\u201d Antonov said. National Security Council communications coordinator John Kirby said the US has not recovered the downed drone from the Black Sea, warning, \u201cI\u2019m not sure we are going to be able to recover it.\u201d \u201cIt has not been recovered and I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to be able to recover it. I mean, where it fell into the Black Sea \u2013 it\u2019s very, very deep water so we\u2019re still assessing whether there can be any kind of recovery effort mounted. There may not be,\u201d Kirby said Wednesday on \u201cCNN This Morning.\u201d  \u2018Unsafe, unprofessional, and reckless\u2019 Antonov, who was inside the State Department for a little over half an hour, said Assistant Secretary Karen Donfried conveyed the US\u2019 concerns about the incident and that they \u201cexchanged our remarks on this issue because we have some differences.\u201d \u201cIt seems to me that it was a constructive conversation on this issue. I have heard her remarks, I hope that she has understood what I have mentioned,\u201d Antonov said in response to a question from CNN. He also claimed that Russia \u201chad informed about this space that was identified as a zone for special military operation.\u201d \u201cWe have warned not to enter, not to penetrate,\u201d he said, asking how the US would react if a Russian drone came close to New York or San Francisco. Antonov reiterated a denial issued by the Russian Ministry of Defense on the incident. They denied the Russian jet had come into contact with the drone in a statement earlier on Tuesday, saying the fighter jets \u201cscrambled to identify the intruder\u201d after detecting it over the Black Sea, adding that the drone \u201cwent into an unguided flight with a loss of altitude.\u201d  \u201cThe drone flew with its transponders off, violating the boundaries of the temporary airspace regime established for the special military operation, communicated to all users of international airspace, and published in accordance with international standards,\u201d the ministry said.  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov Wednesday said relations between Russia and the US are at their \u201clowest point\u201d and in a \u201cdeplorable state.\u201d  According to Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin was briefed on the incident, but there was no contact at the highest level between Moscow and Washington. Peskov added that \u201cRussia did not refuse constructive dialogue, and is not refusing it now.\u201d  President Joe Biden was briefed on the incident by national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Tuesday morning, Kirby said on Tuesday afternoon. Defense Department officials \u201chave not spoken specifically to Russian authorities\u201d on the incident, Ryder said.  Price said separately that the US has \u201cengaged at high levels with our allies and partners\u201d to brief them on the incident. He added that the US was \u201cnot in a position to speak to what the Russians intended to do\u201d with the maneuvers, but that ultimately the intent mattered less than \u201cwhat actually transpired.\u201d  Kirby said it was \u201cnot uncommon\u201d for Russian aircraft to intercept US aircraft over the Black Sea, and said there had been other intercepts in recent weeks. But he said the episode Tuesday was unique in how \u201cunsafe, unprofessional and reckless\u201d the Russian actions were. The US Defense Department is currently working to declassify imagery from the incident, Ryder said Tuesday. He also said that Russia has not recovered the downed drone.  Speaking with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead\u201d on Tuesday, Kirby said the US has \u201ctaken steps to protect our equities with respect to that particular drone.\u201d  \u201cWe obviously don\u2019t want to see anybody getting their hands on it beyond us,\u201d Kirby said. He added that the US rejects Russia\u2019s denial of responsibility, saying that people \u201cshould take everything that the Russians say about what they\u2019re doing in and around Ukraine with a huge grain of salt.\u201d Russian and US aircraft have operated over the Black Sea during the course of the Ukraine war, but this is the first known such interaction, a potentially dangerous escalation at a critical time in the fighting. The US has been operating Reaper drones over the Black Sea since before the beginning of the war, using the spy drones to monitor the area. Reaper drones can fly as high as 50,000 feet, according to the Air Force, and they have sensors and capabilities to gather intelligence and perform reconnaissance for extended periods of time, making it an ideal platform to track movements on the battlefield and in the Black Sea.

            "text": "From a cabin concept that completely eradicates the middle seat to a swanky design that takes single-aisle aircraft business class to a new level, this year\u2019s Crystal Cabin Awards shortlist offers an exciting glimpse at aviation\u2019s potential future. Every year the Crystal Cabin Awards showcase innovative ideas that reconceptualize the airplane cabin experience. There are eight categories, with awards spotlighting everything from eco-friendly innovations \u2013 such as an AI-based food waste app idea from German airline Lufthansa \u2013 to next generation concepts straight from the university classroom.  Julia Grosser, a spokesperson for the Crystal Cabin Award Association, says this year\u2019s shortlist suggests aviation is turning a corner after the uncertainty of the peak pandemic years.  \u201cAirlines, manufacturers, and suppliers are heavily investing in their onboard products again,\u201d Grosser tells CNN Travel, pointing to the \u201csignificant innovation visible even in economy class \u2013 from bunk beds to better connectivity.\u201d In-air innovation Among the shortlisted cabin innovations is Air New Zealand\u2019s \u201cSkynest\u201d concept, which envisages bookable sleeping pods made up of six lie-flat bunk beds, designed to give economy long-haul passengers the opportunity to get some proper shuteye. \u201cBeing a small country at the bottom of the world, long-haul travel is vital to keeping us connected and allowing tourists to visit our beautiful country,\u201d Kerry Reeves, Air New Zealand\u2019s head of aircraft programs, tells CNN Travel. The motivation behind SkyNest is Air New Zealand\u2019s belief that passengers should be able to \u201cget a good rest, no matter the cabin,\u201d as Reeves puts it. The pods are arranged like bunk beds, made up of two rows, each containing three beds, bookable for approximately four hours. Air New Zealand has been working on SkyNest for several years, with the concept first revealed back in 2020. Work\u2019s now firmly underway to make the project a reality \u2013 Reeves says the airline is currently \u201cworking through the in-depth certification and engineering detail of having the Skynest on our new 787 aircraft.\u201d Air New Zealand has also built several prototypes. It\u2019s currently considering whether it can transport one to the 2023 Airline Interiors Expo in Hamburg, Germany \u2013 an aviation symposium where the Crystal Cabin Award Association is set to announce its 2023 winners.    Other shortlisted concepts include Adient Aerospace\u2019s \u201cAscent Front Row Suite,\u201d designed by the aerospace company in cooperation with Boeing EnCore Interiors. Stephanie Faulk, Adient\u2019s director of sales and marketing, says the inspiration for the concept, which has been in the works since early 2022, was \u201cthe design challenge of bringing a wide-body experience to a narrow-body cabin.\u201d \u201cAs the capabilities of narrow-body airplanes grow, they are taking on long-haul missions \u2013 flying increasingly further,\u201d says Faulk. \u201cThe result is an inherent desire for increased comfort and features equivalent to wide-body airplanes.\u201d While business class on wide-body airliners can be a very swanky experience, on narrower aircraft it usually just means a bit more leg room and some upscale food and drink. Adient and Boeing Encore Interiors set about imagining an elevated short-haul business class: a lie-flat bed, loads of storage for luggage, minibar, library and space for another passenger to join you for a meeting or catch-up. Faulk says the concept\u2019s already \u201creceived a lot of interest and positive feedback\u201d from airlines.  While Adient\u2019s design works with the restrictions of pre-existing cabin configurations, the \u201cMulticabin\u201d concept from Spanish architecture company Taller De Arquitectura T36 seeks to completely overhaul the airplane cabin. Taller De Arquitectura T36 imagines three separate economy cabins on two levels. The aim, according to the designers, is to say \u201cgoodbye to middle seats.\u201d The design includes a mix of real and virtual windows. The design would also up the number of seats in the cabin \u2013  always appealing to airlines, even if the emergency exit situation is less obvious. Another shortlisted entry, Euphony, is a new airplane seat concept from French aircraft interior designer Safran Seats, produced in collaboration with audio technology company Devialet, that aims to improve inflight entertainment. Euphony does away with the need for a personal headset. Instead, speakers are installed in each individual seat\u2019s headrest, with sound levels perfected so passengers can enjoy their choice of inflight entertainment without being overheard or disturbed by their neighbor. CNN Travel tested out the concept at last year\u2019s Aircraft Interiors Expo, concluding: \u201cEuphony is no replacement for the cocoon-like experience of noise-canceling headphones, but it\u2019s a comfortable set up and feels more akin to the experience of watching a movie on your couch.\u201d  Next generation ideas  The Crystal Cabin Award\u2019s \u201cUniversity\u201d category offers a glimpse into the minds of the next generation of aviation designers. Take the Tilde Aviation Concept by Joshua Nilsson, a Scottish graduate of the Savannah College of Art and Design. Originally Nilsson\u2019s university senior thesis, it imagines a private, enclosed in-air suite, ideal for passengers traveling in a group. The suite\u2019s configuration can transform from four chairs sitting opposite each other to lie-flat beds. Nilsson tells CNN Travel he was inspired by fond memories of family vacations. \u201cFrom economy to first class, the experiences are designed to be solitary and for me, travel is anything but,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to put connection at the heart of my design which is why I made an aviation suite perfected for group travel.\u201d Nilsson recently moved back to Scotland, where he\u2019s founded his own design studio. He says he hopes the attention of the Crystal Cabin Awards could allow him to make the concept a reality. The Crystal Cabin Awards finalists are set to be announced in May, while the winners will be announced in June.",

Except for a testbed scrapped by Boeing in 2018, these are the first Dreamliners to be retired, and their disassembly, which began in early March, is taking place at Prestwick Airport near Glasgow, Scotland. \u201cThey\u2019re being done side by side and it could take probably three to four months,\u201d says Ken Fitzgibbon, CEO of EirTrade, the Dublin-based aviation trading company that is managing the operation. \u201cThe dismantling process resembles a production line, but it\u2019s reverse engineered, and in the end we aim to recycle about 95% of the aircraft.\u201d EirTrade has previous experience in scrapping young widebody aircraft, having worked on retired A380s from Singapore Airlines and Air France that were also about a decade old. \u201cThe 787 is a very new aircraft and it\u2019s probably hard for people outside of aviation to get their head around this,\u201d says Lee Carey, VP of asset management at Eirtrade, who points to upkeep costs as one of the reasons the planes are being cut up. \u201cThey were coming up to their 12-year check, the heaviest maintenance event that\u2019s going to happen on these aircraft.\u201d As many other 787s that are still flying are also coming up to this landmark maintenance event, demand for parts will spike, making the operation economically viable. \u201cThese particular aircraft already had the engines removed a couple of weeks ago,\u201d says Carey. \u201cWe then commenced the defueling operation to ensure that any hazardous fuels were removed and disposed of correctly.\u201d After that, the aircraft were pulled into a hangar for disassembly. The disassembly team has a \u201charvest list\u201d of material they want \u2014 essentially where most of the value is. As components are removed, they are sent for repairs or overhaul, to get them back into shape: \u201cAfter that, they will go on to be sold to airlines, maintenance companies, equipment manufacturers or aircraft leasing companies around the world to support the rest of the global 787 fleet.\u201d Victims of the pandemic  The planes arrived at their current location at Prestwick Airport in Scotland for storage back in the summer of 2019, after having flown transatlantic routes for Norwegian, via leasing companies, for about six years. They were part of a group of 35 Boeing 787s that were grounded because of problems with their engine blades, which were cracking or corroding prematurely.  But even after a solution was found, the planes never entered service again, and then became engulfed in the pandemic.  In 2020, Norwegian was struggling to survive and filed for bankruptcy. The longer the 787s remained on the ground, the more it would cost to get them to fly again, due to the maintenance work required. As a result, they were no longer airworthy. \u201cPrestwick is a really terrible place to store an airplane, because it\u2019s cold and wet and rainy and moist,\u201d says Connor Diver, a senior analyst at aviation analytics firm Cirium. \u201cNot somewhere you would plan to keep them for a long time. Maybe they were just planning to fix them, but then the other events happened.\u201d  The condition of the aircraft likely played a big role in the fact that no airline came forward to buy them. \u201cThe maintenance on a modern widebody is very, very expensive,\u201d Diver adds. \u201cIf you\u2019re behind and in bad condition, the costs to bring these up to a serviceable state would be prohibitive, most likely. The value of the parts then may be more than the value of the aircraft.\u201d The average value of a similarly aged Boeing 787-8 is around $30 million, but because of the condition they were in, these two aircraft would have been worth less and probably closer to $20 million, according to Diver. Scrapping them for parts and starting a second-hand components market for the 787 therefore became a more appealing option.  Earlier this year, a 10-year-old Boeing 747 in VIP configuration was scrapped with just 16 flights on the clock after failing to find a buyer. Several Airbus A380s of similar age have already been recycled. Now, the 787s have entered the circus: is this the start of a worrying trend of young widebody aircraft being retired too soon? \u201cNever say never, but it could be an isolated incident,\u201d says Diver. \u201cTypically we would expect an airliner to stay in service for 20 to 25 years at least.\u201d \u201cIf they were in good condition and had not sat there for three years, it\u2019s very likely somebody would have wanted them.\u201d",

The crash, which resulted in the death of four people, occurred over Lake Hartridge in Winter Haven, about 45 miles southwest of Orlando. It involved a Piper J-3 Cub seaplane and a Cherokee Piper 161 fixed-wing plane, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.  \u201cAll initial indications we have, and again this is preliminary, were that the Cherokee was self-announcing its location and its intention, and the Cub was not,\u201d Lynn Spencer, an air safety investigator for the eastern region of the NTSB, said Thursday. \u201cThis might indicate that the Cherokee was unaware of the Cub, and if the Cub could not hear what the Cherokee was announcing, they may have been unaware of the Cherokee.\u201d  The Cherokee Piper came nose-to-nose with the Cub as it was making a left, descending turn, Spencer said at a news conference. The Cub \u201cattempted an evasive maneuver,\u201d she said.   \u201cWe do not know what either pilot could see at this point in the investigation. It is too early to have that information,\u201d Spencer said.  The NTSB will look into the planes\u2019 equipment to determine what ability they had to see each other, she said. Both planes were recovered, except for the right wing of the Cherokee Piper.  \u201cOur preliminary information at this point is that neither airplane had any kind of avoidance system radar that would have alerted them to the other aircraft,\u201d Spencer said, noting that it is not required that a pilot communicate or have a radio in the airspace where the crash took place.  Spencer said in these types of planes, pilots must make sure they are visually and spatially aware while flying.  \u201cEvery pilot has a responsibility to see and avoid. It\u2019s a basic regulation. That said, there are limitations imposed by the airframe itself,\u201d she said.  The investigation into the crash remains ongoing, the NTSB said, adding that they have met with the airport manager.  \u201cOur goal at the NTSB is to find the probable cause and to improve aviation safety,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cWe will try to prevent this accident from happening again in this area.\u201d",

Nolen defended his agency\u2019s handling of the safety incidents, some of which were averted when pilots \u2013 not the air traffic controllers from his agency \u2013 avoided a collision. He said officials are \u201ctreating each of these as if it had been an actual event.\u201d    \u201cThe FAA absolutely has a grasp on the situation and it\u2019s something that we look at every day,\u201d Nolen told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ll take a look at these near misses and see if there are lessons to be learned.\u201d He said a major safety meeting next week will include industry officials and ask the \u201chard questions.\u201d    \u201cLet\u2019s just stop to see \u2013 are there any dots that we need to connect, and if so what might they be?\u201d Nolen said.    Inside the committee room, Nolen said that the agency does not take safety for granted and is looking for opportunities to improve.   CNN asked the FAA this week for the exact number of runway incursions this year that have involved commercial airliners. The agency pointed to a database for such incidents, but a number of the incidents that have made headlines in the past month have not yet appeared in that database. The FAA pointed to its Runway Safety Council (RSC) and Runway Safety Action Teams (RSAT) that are aimed at mitigating or eliminating such incidents. Nolen also said that the FAA will use \u201cevery step, every tool that we have available in our disposal\u201d to address unruly passengers like one accused of trying to stab a flight attendant earlier this week.    Last year, the agency logged more than 2,300 reports of unruly passenger behavior. Investigations were initiated in 823 cases, and 80 cases were referred to the FBI for criminal review.",

            "text": "The US Justice Department is suing to stop JetBlue\u2019s proposed $3.8 billion deal to buy discount carrier Spirit Airlines, the first time in more than 20 years that the government has sought to block a US airline merger. The lawsuit, announced Tuesday by Attorney General Merrick Garland, is not a surprise: The Biden administration has argued since taking office there needs to be greater competition between businesses, especially in the airline industry, to lower costs for consumers. Spirit\n            \n                (SAVE), with its low base fare business model that charges customers extra for everything, including carry-on bags, prompts larger carriers to offer a percentage of their seats at the lowest possible price. Garland said that allowing the merger would significantly harm consumers, particularly those who depend on the low fares available on Spirit. \u201cIf not blocked, the merger of JetBlue and Spirit would result in higher fares and fewer choices for tens of millions of travelers across the country. The Justice Department is suing to prevent that from happening,\u201d said Garland. \u201cCompanies in every industry should understand by now that this Justice Department will not hesitate to enforce antitrust laws and protect American consumers.\u201d But over the last 22 years, the Justice Department has allowed a series of five airline mergers without a suit like the one announced Tuesday. Those deals turned nine major US carriers into four \u2013 American Airlines\n            \n                (AAL), Delta Air Lines\n            \n                (DAL), United Airlines\n            \n                (UAL) and Southwest Airlines\n            \n                (LUV). Between them, the airlines control about 80% of the nation\u2019s air traffic. JetBlue\n            \n                (JBLU) argues that the deal would create a new, stronger competitor to those four larger airlines and work to bring down fares, not increase them.  \u201cWe believe the DOJ has got it wrong on the law here and misses the point that this merger will create a national low-fare, high-quality competitor to the Big Four carriers which \u2013 thanks to their own DOJ-approved mergers \u2013 control about 80% of the US market,\u201d said JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes. \u201cThere is too much at stake for the DOJ to prevent us from bringing the JetBlue difference to more customers in more markets.\u201d It argues JetBlue and Spirit primarily compete with other carriers not each other, and thus the combination will not significantly decrease competition. It has offered to give up landing and takeoff slots and gates at crowded airports to other upstart, low-fare carriers, in order to encourage continued competition. \u201cThe combination of JetBlue and Spirit plus the rapid growth of ultra low cost carriers will assure increased competition and low fares,\u201d said a statement from JetBlue. It has vowed to press ahead with its merger efforts and hopes to defeat the lawsuit in time to still close its deal with Spirit by the end of the year. But it has been fighting a separate lawsuit from the Justice Department challenging an alliance it has with American Airlines for nearly 18 months. Spirit once argued against the deal While Spirit also now supports the deal, it had previous opposed being purchased by JetBlue. It originally had agreed to a merger without another ultra low cost carrier, Frontier Airlines, and it argued that a deal with JetBlue faced too many regulatory challenges to be approved because it would raise fares. It gave in to accept the JetBlue deal only when its own shareholders rejected the combination with Frontier in favor of the more lucrative offer from JetBlue. Garland cited a statement from the Spirit board when it was still fighting off the JetBlue deal, when it stated, \u201cA court will be very concerned that a JetBlue-Spirit combination will result in a higher cost, higher fare airline that would eliminate a lower cost, lower fare airline and eliminate about half of lower cost capacity in the United States.\u201d \u201cWe agree,\u201d Garland added after reading that quote. But now the decision on the deal is not in the hands of the Justice Department or two other federal agencies whose approval is also needed before the proposed JetBlue-Spirit combination can be completed \u2013 the Department of Transportation and the Federal Communications Commission. Instead, the decision will be up to federal courts that will hear the case. The Justice Department filed this case in federal court in Boston. It had yet to be assigned to a specific judge as of midday Tuesday.",

            "text": "Families of those on board Malaysia Airlines flight 370, which disappeared mysteriously nearly nine years ago, called on the Malaysian government on Sunday to allow US seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to mount a new search for the missing plane. The fate of flight MH370 became one of the world\u2019s greatest aviation mysteries when it disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014. In 2018, Malaysia engaged Ocean Infinity to search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, offering to pay up to $70 million if it found the plane. But its operation came up short. The firm\u2019s search came after Malaysia, China and Australia ended a fruitless two-year $135 million underwater hunt in January 2017 after finding no trace of the plane. On Sunday, Voice370 \u2013 a grouping of relatives of those aboard the plane \u2013 said Ocean Infinity hoped to embark on a new search as early as this summer and urged the Malaysian government to accept any proposals from the firm on a conditional fee basis, such that the firm would only be paid if successful. \u201cOcean Infinity, over the last 12 months have made real progress working with many people to further understand\u2026 the events in 2014,\u201d Voice370 said in a statement, following a memorial event to mark the ninth year since MH370\u2019s disappearance. \u201cUltimately, this has greatly improved their chances of conducting a successful search.\u201d  Ocean Infinity and Malaysia\u2019s Transport Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a message to families read out at the memorial event, Transport Minister Anthony Loke vowed not to \u201cclose the book\u201d on MH370, adding that due consideration would be given to future searches if there was \u201cnew and credible information\u201d on the aircraft\u2019s potential location. Debris confirmed or believed to be from the MH370 aircraft has washed up along the African coast and on islands in the Indian Ocean. Malaysian investigators previously drew no conclusion about what happened aboard the flight, but did not rule out the possibility that the aircraft had been deliberately taken off course.",

            "text": "Boeing CEO David Calhoun missed out on a $7 million bonus last year, but still got a raise.  Boeing\u2019s proxy filing Friday disclosed that when Calhoun started as CEO of Boeing in January of 2020, the board gave him a $7 million bonus package if he completed a list of goals by the end of 2023. \u201cThe company has substantially achieved, or is on track to substantially achieve, most of these specific goals,\u201d said the filing. But it\u2019s clear one thing it will not do is get its new widebody jet, the 777X, into production and into service. The company announced in April of 2022 that it was pushing back the plane\u2019s debut until 2025. Because of that, the company\u2019s filing said Calhoun will not get the $7 million. However, the filing said the board is pleased with Calhoun\u2019s performance and understands him falling short. \u201cThe Board also recognizes that Mr. Calhoun has made several decisions concerning the management of the 777 program that were in the company\u2019s long-term interest, but that contributed to that goal not being met,\u201d said the filing. \u201cThe board recognizes and greatly appreciates Mr. Calhoun\u2019s leadership and many actions over the last three years to navigate through a constantly changing environment to best position the company for the future, and without regard for the impact his decisions might have had on goals that were set prior to widespread onset of Covid and the changed regulatory environment.\u201d But even without the $7 million, Calhoun\u2019s total compensation package increased to $22.5 million in 2022, up from $21.1 million in 2021. And in February the board awarded Calhoun 25,000 shares of Boeing stock as a retention bonus. He is scheduled to receive that stock in two equal blocks \u2014 the first to be received one year after they were granted and the second received two years from the date they were granted. Those 25,000 shares were worth about $5.3 million on the date of the grant. The new grant \u201creflects the board\u2019s recognition of and continued confidence in Mr. Calhoun\u2019s strong leadership, and is designed to help retain Mr. Calhoun as he continues to lead the work to position the company for the future.\u201d Boeing normally has a mandatory retirement age of 65 for Boeing executives, and Calhoun will turn 66 in April. But in April 2021, the company announced that its board of directors had extended the retirement age for Calhoun to age 70. Boeing had another tough year financially. It reported its fourth straight annual loss, losing $6.6 billion, up from $5.5 billion a year earlier and more than $1 billion worse than expected by analysts at the time of the report. And Boeing management\u2019s performance has been publicly criticized by some of its major customers. In May last year, Michael O\u2019Leary, CEO of Ryanair \u2014 Europe\u2019s largest discount carrier, which has ordered nearly 400 jets from Boeing since 2010 \u2014 let loose a profanity-laced criticism of Boeing management. \u201cAt the moment we think Boeing management is running around like headless chickens, not able to sell aircraft, and then even the aircraft they deliver, they\u2019re not able to deliver them on time,\u201d he said on an earnings call. He said company executives need either an immediate \u201creboot, or a boot up the a**.\u201d  \u201cEither the existing management needs to up its game, or they need to change the existing management, would be our view of life,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy to work with existing management but they need to bloody well improve on what they\u2019ve been doing delivering to us over the last 12 months.\u201d And O\u2019Leary isn\u2019t the only major customer to criticize Boeing management. Domhnal Slattery, the CEO of Avolon, one of the world\u2019s leading aircraft leasing companies, suggested in May that Boeing needs a change in culture \u2014 and maybe leadership. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that Boeing has lost its way,\u201d Slattery said at the Airfinance Journal conference, in comments first reported by Reuters and confirmed by Avolon. \u201cBoeing has a storied history\u2026 They build great airplanes. But it\u2019s said that culture eats strategy for breakfast and that is what has happened at Boeing.\u201d Boeing declined to comment on those key customers\u2019 remarks.",

Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn has been looking to expand its operations in the South Asian giant after suffering severe supply disruptions in China last year. The firm bounced back from the disruptions early this year.  \u201cIndia is a country with a large population,\u201d Young Liu, the company\u2019s chairman and CEO, said in a Saturday statement. \u201cMy trip this week supported Foxconn\u2019s efforts to deepen partnerships \u2026 and seek cooperation in new areas such as semiconductor development and electric vehicles.\u201d \u201cFoxconn will continue to communicate with local governments to seek the most beneficial development opportunities for the company and all stakeholders,\u201d he added. The company, best known for making Apple\n            \n                (AAPL)\u2019s iPhones, is one of the world\u2019s biggest contract makers of electronics. It\u2019s now expanding into other areas including electric vehicles.  Liu did not specify any investment spending in India during his trip, which included a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The company already has factories in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. On Friday, the investment promotion office of the southern Indian state of Karnataka said Foxconn had announced a major deal there and that 300 acres of land had been allocated for a facility. The investment will generate 100,000 jobs over 10 years in the state, it said. According to a report from Bloomberg citing unnamed sources, the company plans to invest about $700 million on a new plant in Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka, to make iPhone parts. India has emerged as an attractive potential alternative to China for the likes of Apple. One of India\u2019s top ministers, Piyush Goyal, said in January that Apple wants to ramp up its production in the South Asian country to a quarter of its overall total from between 5% and 7% now. For years, Apple had relied on a vast manufacturing network in China to mass produce iPhones, iPads and other popular products. But its dependence on the country was tested last year by Beijing\u2019s strict zero-Covid strategy, which was rapidly dismantled last December. Apple devices are currently manufactured in India by Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron, which are all Taiwanese companies. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Diksha Madhok contributed reporting   ",

            "title": "A new generation of airships is taking to the skies",
            "text": "The smooth, white underbelly of the airborne whale sails across the sky, casting a shadow across the forest below.  Other than its enormous size, though, this \u201cwhale\u201d has very little to do with its animal namesake. It\u2019s an airship, and French aeronautics company Flying Whales hopes its hybrid-electric, helium-lift vessel will change the shape of sustainable transport.  The airship could help solve the problem of how to transport cargo \u201cwhen infrastructure is lacking, or just doesn\u2019t exist at all,\u201d says Romain Schlack, Flying Whales\u2019 head of communications. \u201cWe are going to add new possibilities to global logistics, while overcoming obstacles and problems on the ground.\u201d  Airship technology has been around for over 150 years and gained popularity in the early 1900s ferrying passengers and cargo across land and ocean.  But as airplanes became faster and more advanced, airships couldn\u2019t keep up. Then, in 1937, an airship called the Hindenburg burst into flames, killing 36 people, firmly marking the end of the golden age of airships. Now, nearly 90 years later, interest in the lighter-than-air transport is reviving. With low carbon emissions, and no requirement for expensive ground infrastructure like airports or roads, because they can load and unload cargo while hovering, airships could be a sustainable solution for logistics across the globe.  Remote deliveries Flying Whales is developing a 200-meter-long airship that will be lifted by 14 cells filled with helium gas, and then propelled through the air by a hybrid-electric system powered with sustainable aviation fuel.  Carrying at least two crew members, the airships will be able to up to transport 60 tons of cargo \u2013 around the same as two to three freight trucks. Schlack says the \u201cflying whales\u201d are designed to carry heavy, bulky items such as blades for wind turbines, logs collected from steep mountainsides, or construction materials being delivered to remote, isolated locations. Airships could also deliver food or aid after natural disasters, when railways or roads might be inaccessible.   Compared to helicopters, which are the go-to transport for remote cargo deliveries, Flying Whales claims its airships will produce less than 10% of the carbon emissions while operating \u2013 plus their freight system leaves wilderness and countryside untouched, while still connecting small, rural communities to the wider global supply chain.  Hydrogen versus helium Flying Whales is not the only company trying to revive airships: other startups, such as LTA Research, backed by Google co-founder Sergey Brin, are also exploring this low-impact transport solution.  But a key question facing manufacturers is which lighter-than-air gas to fill the balloons with: hydrogen or helium? Hydrogen is cheap, renewable, and has more lifting power than helium. However, it\u2019s highly flammable and has long been associated with devastating airship disasters like the Hindenburg.  That\u2019s why most companies, including Flying Whales and LTA Research, are using helium, which is non-flammable.   However, helium is less buoyant than hydrogen and more expensive, with unstable prices: between 2011 and 2016, its price increased 250%, and in 2020, it was up to 67 times more expensive than hydrogen.  More importantly, though, the helium supply could run out.  At current usage rates, the American Chemical Society says it could go extinct within the next century. That\u2019s a problem because helium is vitally important for a variety of industries. It\u2019s used in medical equipment like MRI machines, and there is currently no alternative. Barry Prentice, professor and former director of the transport Institute at the Asper School of Business at the University of Manitoba, says that\u2019s why it\u2019s vital that airships start using hydrogen again.  Prentice is also the founder and president of BASI, a Manitoba-based company specializing in airships adapted for cold climates. The company is developing an airship that uses hydrogen for lift, in the hope that the Canadian government will relax its regulations on the use of hydrogen. Advancements in science and technology over the last century have made the gas safer to use, says Prentice. For example, hydrogen is only flammable when mixed with air, something that might occur if there is a leak in the balloon \u2013 which is what\u2019s suspected to have happened on the Hindenburg. Modern technology such as \u201chydrogen sniffers\u201d which detect leaks can help manage this, says Prentice.   And while the FAA lists hydrogen as an unsuitable lifting gas in its criteria for airship certification, the European Aviation Safety Agency updated its regulations in 2022, allowing any lifting gas, as long as the associated risks can adequately be addressed and mitigated by the design.  BASI is not the only organization pursuing hydrogen-lift airships: FlyWin, an airship design project based at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium is exploring materials and design to allow safe use of hydrogen, while hydrogen delivery company H2 Clipper is aiming to have its hydrogen-lift airship in commercial operation before 2030.  Those opting for helium say that the volume needed for airships is minimal compared to the supply. \u201cEach airship will be filled with 180,000 cubic meters of helium,\u201d says Schlack. With 160 million cubic meters produced globally in 2021, each airship would account for around 0.1% of annual helium production. \u201cWe are pretty confident in the supply for our aircrafts,\u201d he says, adding that helium isn\u2019t consumed by airships, but is \u201cstored\u201d in the balloons, and only requires small top ups from time to time.   Scaling up, up and away Choice of gas isn\u2019t the only challenge \u2013 scale is also an issue.  \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a small airship,\u201d says Prentice. Companies need to invest in giant workshop spaces, and prototypes need to be tested, altered, and re-tested successfully before a commercial production line can even be considered, he says. Flying Whales plans to build its first hangar and assembly line next year in Laruscade, near Bordeaux, France, but other companies are getting ahead by using historic hangars.  LTA Research purchased Akron Airdock in Ohio, built in 1929, and leases Hangar Two at Moffett Field near San Francisco Bay in California, built in 1933. And UK-based Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV) is making use of hangars at Cardington Airfield, in the south of England, which were used to build airships in the 1920s and 1930s.  Finding premises has given these companies a head start. LTA\u2019s 400-foot (122-meter) long prototype is already floating inside its California hangar and HAV tested its first hybrid aircraft, the Airlander 10, in 2016.  Flying Whales expects to test its first airship at the end of 2025, with commercial operations beginning in 2027 once the airship is certified. Schlack says the company plans to rapidly scale up production after that. It has a second assembly line planned for Quebec and is searching for a partner in Asia to set up a third.  The company raised \u20ac122 million ($130 million) last year, which it will use to grow the teams at its offices in France and Canada, and is already discussing needs and requirements with prospective clients, ahead of launching its commercial services.  \u201cOur goal is to have airships more or less everywhere,\u201d says Schlack.",

            "text": "Two US nationals were arrested in Kansas City on Thursday for allegedly sending US aviation technology to Russia, the Justice Department announced.  Cyril Gregory Buyanovsky, 59, and Douglas Robertson, 55, are facing several charges, including exporting controlled goods without a license, falsifying and failing to file electronic export information, and smuggling goods contrary to US law. Their arrest is the most recent move by the Justice Department\u2019s Task Force KleptoCapture, made up of federal prosecutors, investigators and analysts, which has worked for the past year to wage a global campaign against money laundering and sanctions evasion in support of the Russian government. Its work has resulted in over 30 indictments against sanctioned supporters of the Kremlin and Russian military, according to the Justice Department.    The two men\u2019s US-based KanRus Trading Company sold and installed Western electronic equipment for airplanes, according to prosecutors, and allegedly sold equipment to Russian companies and provided repair services for Russian aircrafts. To get around US sanctions, prosecutors say Buyanovsky and Robertson concealed who their clients were, lied about how much products cost and were paid through foreign bank accounts. After Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine began last year, the US government imposed additional sanctions on shipments to Russia. Buyanovsky and Robertson discussed their options for continuing to send shipments to at least one client in Russia, prosecutors say, including by sending shipments through third-party countries. A KanRus shipment in February 2022 was flagged by the Department of Commerce because it did not have the proper licensing, according to the indictment. Soon after, Robertson, who is a commercial pilot, allegedly told a Russia-based client that \u201cthings are complicated in the USA\u201d and that invoices needed to be less than $50,000 because otherwise there would be \u201cmore paperwork and visibility,\u201d adding that \u201cthis is NOT the right time for either.\u201d A shipment to that Russian client was later sent through Laos, prosecutors say.   Lawyers for Buyanovsky and Robertson are not yet listed.",

The game has already resurrected lots of historical aircraft in its virtual skies, but this one\u2019s a little special. All proceeds from the $19.99 add-on go toward the Antonov Company\u2019s real-life efforts to reconstruct the mighty beast known as \u201cMriya\u201d (Ukrainian for \u201cdream\u201d).  The massive six-engine craft \u2013 some 275 feet, 7 inches in length \u2013 was built in the 1980s to carry the Soviet space shuttle and was the only one of its kind ever completed.  Mriya\u2019s next role was as the world\u2019s largest cargo transporter, boasting twice the hold capacity of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet. Its wingspan was 290 feet, the longest of any fully operational aircraft, and with a maximum payload weight of 250 tonnes, it remains the heaviest aircraft ever built. The Antonov AN-225 was destroyed at its base in Hostomel, near Kyiv, in February 2022, but in November last year its manufacturers confirmed that the rebuilding project had begun. Antonov estimated that it would need more than \u20ac500 million ($532 million) to get it back in the air.   \u201cThe process of rebuilding \u2018Mriya\u2019 is considered as an international project, with the participation of aviation enterprises of different countries of the world,\u201d the Antonov Company told CNN via email at the time. \u201cThe possibility of attracting funding from various sources is being considered and proposals from many organizations that are ready to join the project are being reviewed.\u201d The Microsoft Flight Simulator version of the Antonov AN-225 Mriya comes in six liveries, including classic Antonov Airlines designs and an Xbox Aviators Club one.  The add-on is available now in the Microsoft Flight Simulator in-game marketplace on PC for $19.99 and will be available for Xbox Series X|S and on Xbox Cloud Gaming starting in late March. The much-loved flight simulator game celebrated its 40th anniversary in November 2022, having gone through a major reboot in 2020 when it returned with hyper-realistic scenery, digitally distilled from satellite imagery. In-game pilots can explore the world, flying over a range of 1.5 billion buildings, two million cities, and stopping in at more than 37,000 airports. That\u2019s in real-world conditions too, day or night: the program features live real-time weather including wind speed and direction, temperature, lighting, humidity and rain.  Individualized instrument guidance and checklists are available for the wide variety of aircraft pilots can test their skills in, from light aircraft to commercial jets.  Mriya fans can also support the rebuild efforts by building their own models of the iconic craft. Ukrainian startup Metal Time is selling working mechanical design kits of the AN-225 for $99.  Profits go straight to Antonov to fund the reconstruction, as well as the rehousing of Antonov employees whose homes have been destroyed by the Russian invasion, and training for new Ukrainian pilots and aviation engineers.",

            "text": "Phil Washington, the White House\u2019s pick to lead the Federal Aviation Administration, is going to face tough questions in his confirmation hearing about his ability to lead an agency facing the challenges the agency faces.  Among those challenges: a series of close-call plane accidents in the United States.  Washington is expected to get grilled by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation Wednesday on a slew of aviation issues that have emerged since he was nominated last summer. It\u2019s been nearly a year since the FAA has operated with a permanent administrator \u2014 and in that time, the agency has contended with several problems that have plagued travelers and the airline industry, such as recent near-collisions involving airliners, crucial staffing shortages and malfunctions of aging technology that have cause major air travel disruption. Five recent near-collisions on US runways, including one more this week in Boston, have prompted federal safety investigators to open multiple inquiries and a sweeping review.  Boston  Air traffic controllers stopped JetBlue flight from running into a departing private jet as it was coming in to land on the evening of February 27 night in Boston. The FAA is investigating the incident. The two planes involved in the apparent close call at Boston Logan International Airport came within 565 feet (172 meters) of colliding, according to Flightradar24\u2019s preliminary review of its data. According to a preliminary review, the pilot of a Learjet 60 took off without clearance while JetBlue Flight 206 was preparing to land on an intersecting runway,\u201d the FAA said in a statement. \u201cJetBlue 206, go around,\u201d said the controller in Boston Logan\u2019s tower, according to recordings archived by LiveATC.net. The FAA says its air traffic controller told the crew of the Learjet to \u201cline up and wait\u201d on Runway 9 as the JetBlue Embraer 190 approached the intersecting Runway 4 Right. \u201cThe Learjet pilot read back the instructions clearly but began a takeoff roll instead,\u201d the FAA said in a statement. \u201cThe pilot of the JetBlue aircraft took evasive action and initiated a climb-out as the Learjet crossed the intersection.\u201d Burbank  Last week, the National Transportation Safety Board said that a crew of a landing Mesa Airlines CRJ900 \u201cexecuted a pilot-initiated go-around\u201d as a SkyWest Embraer E175 was taking off from the same runway. A go-around is a routine measure to abort a landing on the approach. The NTSB says neither airplane was damaged and nobody on board was hurt. LiveATC.net recordings from the time of the incident chronicle confusion over whether the SkyWest flight was off the runway at Bob Hope Burbank Airport in California. It\u2019s unclear how close the two planes came to a collision. \u201cIs he off the runway yet?\u201d asked one unidentified voice. \u201cWe\u2019re going around,\u201d responded the crew of the Mesa flight. \u201cThe Mesa pilot discontinued the landing and initiated a climb out,\u201d said a FAA statement, which is also investigating the incident. \u201cMeanwhile, the SkyWest aircraft continued with its departure, which prompted an automated alert to sound on the flight deck of the Mesa aircraft,\u201d the FAA said. The controller instructed the Mesa crew to turn to a course that took it away from the other aircraft.\u201d Austin A Southwest passenger jet and a FedEx cargo plane came as close as 100 feet from colliding on February 5 at the main airport in Texas\u2019 capital, and it was a pilot \u2013 not air traffic controllers \u2013 who averted disaster, a top federal investigator says. Controllers at Austin\u2019s airport had cleared the arriving FedEx Boeing 767 and a departing Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 jet to use the same runway, and the FedEx crew \u201crealized that they were overflying the Southwest plane,\u201d Jennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, told CNN. The FedEx pilot told the Southwest crew to abort taking off, she said. The FedEx plane, meanwhile, climbed as its crew aborted their landing to help avoid a collision, the FAA said. Honolulu On January 23, there was an incident at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport involving a United Airlines 777 jet and a smaller, single-engine cargo plane at the Hawaii airport.  The United jet improperly crossed a runway, while the cargo aircraft was landing, the FAA said. At the closest point, the aircraft were separated by 1,170 feet. The cargo aircraft involved in the incident is a smaller Cessna 206 turboprop operated by Kamaka Air, which ferries goods between the Hawaiian islands. The airline did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The NTSB announced the investigation the day after Billy Nolen, the acting FAA administrator, directed his agency in a memo to \u201cmine the data to see whether there are other incidents that resemble ones we have seen in recent weeks.\u201d New York - JFK On January 13, a close call between an American Airlines and Delta Air Lines flights sparked alarm. The crew of a Delta Boeing 737 aborted its takeoff, ultimately stopping within 1,000 feet of the taxiing AA\u2019s Boeing 777, the FAA said. No one was hurt in the incident, which took place around on a Friday evening.  Air traffic controllers had \u201cnoticed another aircraft crossing the runway in front of the departing jetliner,\u201d the FAA said in a statement. \u201cAccording to a preliminary analysis, Delta Air Lines Flight 1943 stopped its takeoff roll approximately 1,000 feet before reaching the point where American Airlines Flight 106, a Boeing 777, had crossed from an adjacent taxiway.\u201d According to Delta, its flight \u2013 a 737-900 bound for Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic \u2013 had 145 customers and six crew members on board. Audio recordings detail swift action by an air traffic controller kept the airplanes from colliding as they drew closer. \u201cS\u2013t!\u201d exclaimed the controller from the tower of John F. Kennedy International Airport on Friday night. \u201cDelta 1943 cancel takeoff clearance!\u201d The NTSB is investigating the incident.",

Too far, too fast for tech and growth? Some fear this ferocious rebound in consumer and tech stocks may be happening too quickly. After all, inflation remains the number-one concern for the Federal Reserve. More rate hikes are likely, and that could slow the economy and take a bite out of earnings growth. That makes it harder to justify sky-high stock prices. \u201cThere are worries that the Fed is going to create a recession,\u201d said Paul Nolte, a senior wealth adviser and market strategist with Murphy & Sylvest. \u201cThat means there are broader opportunities outside of tech and growth stocks and more in the value and small cap sectors.\u201d Growth stocks, and tech in particular, make more sense as investments if the Fed were set to start slashing interest rates.  Analysts at the BlackRock Investment Institute said in a report this week that the dip in value stocks so far this year was primarily due to hopes that the Fed would begin to ease its monetary policy stance and cut rates if inflation ebbed and the economy began to slow. But that no longer seems to be in the cards.  \u201cWe think value can regain the lead. Why? Higher interest rates and inflation, and a steeper yield curve. That all favors value over growth,\u201d the BlackRock analysts said. The potential re-emergence of China\u2019s economy following years of Covid-related shutdowns could also boost commodity prices\u2026 and the more value-oriented oil stocks that tend to rise along with crude prices.  \u201cWe expect broad commodity indexes to move higher, given constrained supply and strong demand. Commodities should benefit from China\u2019s reopening,\u201d said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a report. Add all that up and it could mean that the recent rebound for Tesla, big techs and media firms and other consumer stocks could be short-lived. \u201cInflation and interest rate uncertainty means we continue to believe value stocks, including the global energy sector, will outperform growth stocks,\u201d Haefele said.",

            "text": "Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKA)\u2019s operating earnings fell during the fourth quarter of 2022, as inflation pressures and high interest rates bogged down businesses at the company run by investor Warren Buffett, though the full year profits reached a \u201crecord.\u201d  Berkshire\u2019s operating profit, or the total profit from core operations before tax and interest, was $6.7 billion in the fourth quarter last year, Buffett said in his highly-anticipated annual shareholder letter Saturday. That was a nearly 8% drop from the company\u2019s third quarter earnings of $7.8 billion. For the full year 2022, however, Berkshire Hathaway operating earnings reached what it called a \u201crecord\u201d \u2013 $30.8 billion in 2022, topping the $27.5 billion in the prior year.  Operating earnings are Buffett\u2019s preferred measure of profitability. \u201cSome of it had to do with currency fluctuations and things like that,\u201d said Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management. \u201cSo this is a short term noise. I would not be concerned at all.\u201d Investors regularly pore over the annual shareholder letter from Buffett when it is released each year, not just to learn how the company did in the prior year but to see what insights the 92-year-old \u201cOracle of Omaha,\u201d has on current  economic conditions and what he expects in the future.  Berkshire Hathaway bought back $2.6 billion of its own stock in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, bringing the total it paid to repurchase its shares in 2022 to $7.9 billion. The company also bought back shares in 2021, repurchasing $6.9 billion of the company\u2019s stock during that year\u2019s fourth quarter, which helped boost the company\u2019s earnings per share.  At the end of 2022, the company\u2019s cash level reached about $125 billion.  \u201cWhen you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive),\u201d Buffett said in this year\u2019s letter, in a directly addressing critics of the practice.  \u201cThat was a direct comment essentially, to Biden and others that are of that mindset that buying back stock is harmful in some way to the country,\u201d said Check. In his State of the Union address February 7, Biden called for quadrupling the tax on stock buybacks. The president has been a vocal critic about the practice companies use to return money to shareholders.  Buffett believes stock buybacks benefit existing shareholders, and is well aware of the disapproval. \u201cAs for the future, Berkshire will always hold a boatload of cash and U.S. Treasury bills along with a wide array of businesses,\u201d Buffett said in the shareholder letter. \u201cWe will also avoid behavior that could result in any uncomfortable cash needs at inconvenient times, including financial panics and unprecedented insurance losses.\u201d Investors also were anticipating Buffett\u2019s thoughts on high interest rates and inflation. The billionaire has lived through many eras of high inflation, and was particularly concerned in the 70s and 80s, when rising oil prices caused an inflationary shock. Steven Check noted that theshareholder letter had \u201cabout one sentence\u201d that referenced those issues. It said, on page 8, that \u201cBerkshire also offers some modest protection from runaway inflation, but this attribute is far from perfect. Huge and entrenched fiscal deficits have consequences.\u201d \u201cHe pointed out that Berkshire is somewhat of a hedge against inflation, but that\u2019s about it,\u201d Check said. \u201cBetter than owning a bond.\u201d",

            "text": "Boeing has been forced to halt deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner once again, just months after it resumed deliveries to customers following a year-long halt. Boeing will have to conduct additional analysis of the fuselage in order to address new concerns of the Federal Aviation Administration, according to statements from the regulator and the company.  \u201cIn reviewing certification records, Boeing discovered an analysis error by our supplier related to the 787 forward pressure bulkhead,\u201d said the company, referring to the portion of a plane at its nose that maintains the pressurized conditions in the cabin. \u201cWe notified the FAA and have paused 787 deliveries while we complete the required analysis and documentation.\u201d \u201cDeliveries will not resume until the FAA is satisfied that the issue has been addressed,\u201d said the agency. \u201cThe FAA is working with Boeing to determine any actions that might be required for recently delivered airplanes.\u201d While the 787 Dreamliners have not been grounded, the FAA had ordered a halt to deliveries of the widebody jet between May of 2021 and July of 2022 as it looked into questions about quality control during its assembly process.  Boeing continued to build the 787 even while it was prevented from making deliveries in late 2021 and much of 2022. It was able to deliver much of that backlog once it was given clearance to resume deliveries, as it delivered 34 Dreamliners between August of last year and January of this year. Boeing plans to maintain assembly of the planes once again during this current delivery halt. \u201cThere is no immediate safety of flight concern for the in-service fleet,\u201d Boeing\u2019s statement said. \u201cProduction continues and this is not expected to increase airplane rework. We are communicating with our customers and will continue to follow the lead of the FAA. While near-term deliveries will be impacted, at this time we do not anticipate a change to our production and delivery outlook for the year.\u201d But a halt of deliveries is another financial blow to the already struggling Boeing, which gets most of its money from its airline customers at the time that planes are delivered.  Boeing, which had its best selling plane, the 737 Max, grounded for 20 months from March of 2019 through November of 2021 following two fatal crashes, has reported deep financial losses totaling $26.3 billion over the course of the last four years.  Shares of Boeing\n            \n                (BA), which had been up 9% so far this year through Thursday\u2019s close and up more than 30% since it got clearance from the FAA to resume 787 deliveries in late July, lost 4% in morning trading Friday on the latest news.  \u2013 CNN\u2019s Gregory Wallace contributed to this report",

            "text": "As Qantas gears up for the 2025 launch of its ultra long-haul \u201cProject Sunrise\u201d flights, the airline is offering a sneak peek of what passengers in the plane\u2019s front section will experience on the 19-hour record-breaking journeys.   On Thursday, the airline revealed the first and business class cabin prototypes for the 12 Airbus A350s that will service the direct flights connecting Australia with New York and London.  Given the time passengers will spend in the air, enhancing comfort is a priority for the designers.  \u201cQantas has been the leader in opening up new long-haul flights for most of our history, and we\u2019re bringing everything we\u2019ve learned, both technically and in terms of passenger comfort, to Project Sunrise flying,\u201d Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce said in a press statement.  In addition to working with designers and aviation specialists, the airline also enlisted the help of a team of scientists, including sleep researchers, from the University of Sydney\u2019s Charles Perkins Centre.  The Project Sunrise A350s will seat only 238 passengers, a sharp drop from the usual 300-plus seat layout, to provide more space for fliers.  The layout includes six first class seats in a 1-1-1 configuration, 52 business class seats in 1-2-1, 40 premium economy seats in 2-4-2 and 140 economy seats in 3-3-3. \u201cWe think our A350 cabins have the most sophisticated and thoughtful design of any airline, combining cutting-edge technology with sleep research to shape the look and feel for what is effectively a new era of travel,\u201d said Joyce. First look at Project Sunrise\u2019s first and business cabins The first class cabin seats, or First Suites, will feature an extra-wide fixed bed, a 22-inch wide recliner lounge chair, a full-length wardrobe, a folding dining table \u2013 large enough for two \u2013 and a 32-inch ultra-high definition TV. The airline says customers will \u201cfeel like they are in a mini boutique hotel.\u201d   Business class suites will be 42 inches wide with 25-inch-wide chairs that can be reclined into a two-meter bed. They will also include a cushioned leather ottoman, a large mirror, plenty of storage space and an 18-inch ultra-high definition touchscreen TV.  All Business and First Suites will be enclosed by high walls and have a sliding door for privacy. They will also have multiple charging options for personal devices, including a wireless induction charging dock.  \u201cWe began designing this aircraft cabin five years ago, working with Airbus and Qantas to maximize space, as well as creating a tailored lighting program that will influence mood and sleep patterns,\u201d said David Caon, the designer of the cabin, in the statement. \u201cAll the design and service elements will work together to significantly improve inflight comfort, convenience and health and well-being and help minimize the old nemesis of jetlag.\u201d The premium economy and economy class prototypes have yet to be released, but the airline says all passengers will have access to free  high-speed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.  That means no more tangled earphone cables, allowing you to connect your Bluetooth headset to the in-flight entertainment system. The planes will also feature a \u201cWellbeing Zone\u201d to give passengers a chance to stretch their legs and enjoy refreshments. Some of the world\u2019s longest flights The name \u201cProject Sunrise\u201d was inspired by clandestine World War II flights from Perth to Sri Lanka en route to London. They were fraught with danger and lasted so long that they saw two sunrises. To prepare for the launch of Project Sunrise, Qantas conducted three trial research trips in 2019.  During these flights, pilots wore brainwave monitors and had their urine tested in the weeks before and after the flights to track levels of melatonin, a hormone that controls sleep cycles.  Passengers in the main cabin wore monitoring devices, allowing scientists to study how their \u201chealth, well-being and body clock\u201d were impacted by a set of variables including lighting, food and drink, movement, sleep patterns and inflight entertainment. This data was presented to Australia\u2019s Civil Aviation Safety Authority, which will need to approve the routes based on proof that pilots, cabin crew and passengers can cope with up to 22 hours in the air without a break.  One of the trial flights, Flight QF7879 \u2013 which CNN experienced first-hand \u2013 became the world\u2019s longest passenger flight by a commercial airline both for distance (17,800 kilometers, or about 11,060 miles) and duration in the air (19 hours and 19 minutes).  Living up to the project\u2019s name, passengers did indeed experience two sunrises. In terms of the world\u2019s longest scheduled passenger flight currently in service, that honor goes to Singapore Airlines\u2019 Singapore-JFK flight, which covers 9,536.5 miles. Flights from Singapore to JFK take 18 hours and 5 minutes, while JFK to Singapore takes 18 hours and 40 minutes, due to the headwind.",

            "text": "US stocks plunged on Tuesday after fourth-quarter earnings and forecasts from mega-retailers like Walmart and Home Depot raised concerns about the strength of the US consumer.  The Dow and S&P 500 each closed with their worst day since December 15 \u2013 the Dow fell about 696 points, or 2.1%, while the S&P dropped by 2%. The Nasdaq Composite closed 2.5% lower. Consumer spending accounts for about 70% of America\u2019s gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, so a slowdown could weigh on growth and even send the United States into a recession. Recent economic data has been strong. But sticky inflation and, now, warnings from bellwether retail companies like Walmart and Home Depot have traders worried that the already hawkish Fed will keep rates higher for longer. Walmart\n            \n                (WMT) topped revenue expectations, but shares of the stock fell nearly 2% in morning trading after the retailer lowered its outlook for the year ahead. Walmart\n            \n                (WMT)\u2019s CFO said that he was worried about inflation and its impact on the US consumer.  \u201cThe consumer is still very pressured, and if you look at economic indicators, balance sheets are running thinner and savings rates are declining relative to previous periods,\u201d Walmart CFO John Rainey said during the earnings call. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s why we take a pretty cautious outlook on the rest of the year.\u201d Shares of the company\u2019s stock recovered by the early afternoon, closing up by about 0.6%.  Home Depot\n            \n                (HD) reported record earnings for the fiscal year that ended in January, and boosted both its hourly wage for employees and the stock dividend for its investors. But the fourth quarter numbers painted a different picture, as the company missed revenue expectations for the first time since 2019, before the pandemic.  The company also lowered its outlook for the year ahead as executives struck a more cautious tone about recession and inflation forecasts on the call that followed earnings. Shares of Home Depot stock fell by 7.1% on Tuesday.  \u201cAfter a year of defying gravity, the slowing economy and pressures on consumers have finally caught up with Home Depot,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData. \u201cFor most of 2022, the number of existing homes sold has been in decline. However, the pace of decline accelerated in December with the volume of completed sales down by a sharp 36.3%.\u201d Still, the home improvement chain said it isn\u2019t taking a hit from the weakness in the home sale market that is resulting from higher mortgage rates. In fact CFO Richard McPhail said the company could be benefiting from the current state of the housing market, as homeowners have more incentive to fix up their current homes rather than move. \u201cOver 90% of US homeowners either own their homes outright or have fixed rate mortgages under 5%,\u201d McPhail said. \u201cAnd so that incentive to sell and move to a higher rate mortgage just isn\u2019t there. And in fact, the incentive is really there to improve in place.\u201d Target, Best Buy, Macy\u2019s and Gap will report later this month. Investors, meanwhile, are gearing up for a week full of important economic data. Wednesday will bring the minutes from the Fed\u2019s last meeting, and a second revision of GDP will come out on Thursday. On Friday January\u2019s Personal Consumption Expenditures \u2013 the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, will be released.",

            "text": "Japan\u2019s H3 rocket, the country\u2019s first new medium-lift launcher in three decades, failed to lift off on Friday because two secondary booster engines strapped to the side of the space vehicle didn\u2019t ignite. During the live-streamed event, the H3\u2019s main engine cut off after the launch countdown had reached zero, leaving the 57-meter (187ft) rocket on its launch pad at the Tanegashima spaceport along with its payload, the ALOS-3 land observation satellite, which is also equipped with an infrared sensor designed to detect North Korean ballistic missiles. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) said it is investigating the cause of the apparent failure. Japan built the H3 to enhance its independent access to space and bolster its chances of capturing a bigger share of the global launch market from rivals, including Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX. It is designed to put government and commercial satellites into orbit and ferry supplies to the International Space Station. As part of Tokyo\u2019s deepening cooperation with the United States in space, later variants will also carry cargo to the Gateway lunar space station that NASA plans to build as part of its program to return people to the moon.  The United States has promised Japan a seat on one of its crewed lunar missions. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 7011.T, the H3\u2019s builder and launch manager, hopes the rocket will boost its space ambitions as SpaceX shakes up commercial launches with its reusable rockets, including the Falcon 9.  A September report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies put the cost of a Falcon 9 launch to low earth orbit at $2,600 per kilogram. The equivalent price tag for H3\u2019s predecessor, the H-II, is $10,500. \u201cWith the H3 we are aiming to halve the cost per launch,\u201d a Mitsubishi Heavy spokesperson said before the planned launch. A successful first mission would have put the Japanese rocket into space ahead of the planned launch this year of the European Space Agency\u2019s new lower-cost Ariane vehicle.",

            "text": "A Boeing 747 configured as a private VIP jet is being scrapped after having spent just 30 hours in service over 16 flights.  The aircraft, originally intended for a Saudi royal, sat on the ground for almost 10 years at EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg, located at the border between France, Switzerland and Germany.  There, it was meant to be fitted with a lavish interior, but that never happened, and after failing to find a new buyer, the plane was eventually flown to Pinal Airpark in Arizona \u2013 an aircraft boneyard where retired planes get stripped for parts or stored indefinitely. Fit for a royal The plane is a BBJ, for \u201cBoeing Business Jet\u201d \u2013 heavily modified editions of Boeing\u2019s jetliners targeted to governments and corporate clients. Its range of over 10,000 miles and cabin space of about 5,000 square feet are unrivaled by any other business aircraft. It\u2019s also the most advanced model of the Boeing 747 ever produced \u2013 the 747-8 variant \u2013 which first flew in 2010 but failed to find commercial success due to being expensive to operate. The final one, delivered to cargo operator Atlas Air in early 2023, marked the end of the 747\u2019s production history, though the variant still has a future in the spotlight: two 747-8s are currently being transformed into the next  Air Force One planes.  Boeing has sold over 250 BBJs to date, the vast majority of them 737s, which have a broader market appeal. The large, expensive, four-engined BBJ 747-8 was a harder sell: \u201cTen were built in total, and this is the first one retired,\u201d says Connor Diver, a senior analyst at aviation analytics firm Cirium. \u201cIt\u2019s not transparent who exactly is buying them, but it\u2019s a very, very large private aircraft and the only operators or buyers tend to be governments and royal families.\u201d This particular one was intended for the Saudi Arabian government, and specifically for the Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, but he died in 2011, just months before the scheduled delivery. The plane, which was assigned a mandatory registration code \u2013 N458BJ \u2013 first flew in May 2012 for testing, and was officially delivered in June 2012. \u201cAccording to our database, it flew via possibly San Bernardino and then San Antonio in Texas for a couple of months, and then in December of 2012 it went to Basel,\u201d says Diver. Typically, large business jets are delivered in what\u2019s called a \u201cgreen\u201d condition \u2013 from the color of the protective coating of the fuselage \u2013 which means they are empty inside and the interior needs to be installed. \u201cI\u2019m guessing that\u2019s the reason it went there initially, to be fitted out,\u201d says Diver. \u201cOf course, that never happened. And it looks like it sat there for 10 years.\u201d  No buyers In 2017, orphaned from its original purpose, the plane went up for sale for $95 million \u2013 down from an original list price of around $350 million, according to Diver. It was still empty and advertised as \u201cready for conversion\u201d in a brochure that can still be found online. But it never sold. \u201cNo one apart from a Saudi head of state is going to want a private, four-engine business jet,\u201d says Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at AeroDynamic Advisory. \u201cYou can\u2019t convert just one aircraft to cargo, and nobody wants a passenger version. As a consequence, the parts and especially the engines, are worth far more than the airplane.\u201d  One major hurdle to a sale was the high cost of fitting the interior. \u201cFitting one of these out would cost 30, 40 maybe 50 million dollars,\u201d says Diver, \u201cAlthough you might think it\u2019s a brand new aircraft, the alternate uses for it are rather limited. The commercial passenger variant had a limited production and very few airlines operated it, and they would not be interested in taking any more. So the only other option was potentially another government, but obviously that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Boeing, which declined to answer a series of questions about the plane when contacted by CNN, eventually bought it back in 2022, from an aircraft trading company called Aircraft Finance Germany. The plane flew to Arizona on April 15, 2022, adding 10 more hours to its time in the air, representing about a quarter of its total flying time. Its very last takeoff from Basel, was immortalized on YouTube by planespotters.   Scrap value At Pinal Airpark, a Boeing contractor is still working on disassembling the plane, which has been stripped of the most valuable parts. \u201cI\u2019ve seen pictures of it and it\u2019s been dismantled already, the engines have already been removed,\u201d says Diver. \u201cThey were effectively brand new, and one of them is probably in the region of $20 million, so four would be in the region of $80 million.\u201d  Major systems like the auxiliary power unit and some of the environmental control systems would also have been among the first to go, according to Aboulafia.  \u201cTotal production of the 747-8 is about 150 aircraft,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a small group of users and a small number of aircraft. But on the other hand, they\u2019re going to want to keep those going. I suspect a lot of the components will probably go to the cargo folks.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether the plane will be scrapped entirely or put in storage to be harvested for parts later. \u201cWhat can happen in these cases is that it will sit there until a certain part is needed. They might not necessarily take it all the way down to scrap, and leave it for a few years until somebody wants a specific part,\u201d says Diver. Nine other BBJ 747s are still being operated by the governments of Egypt, Kuwait, Morocco, Oman, Qatar and Turkey, according to Diver. With the lifespan of a 747 usually clocking in at 25 to 30 years, this one being retired at just 10 years of age is going to set a record that will be difficult to beat.

            "text": "From returning to the sky in new livery to fly for another airline, to being recycled for parts or moving an aircraft boneyard, the possibilities for retired aircraft are seemingly endless.  Some have been converted into restaurants, museums, cafes and even party venues. But this private jet turned luxury villa, located on a clifftop near Nyang-Nyang beach on the Indonesian island of Bali, may be one of the most beautiful aircraft transformations to date. Formerly part of the now defunct Mandala Airlines\u2019 fleet, the retired Boeing 737 was purchased by developer Felix Demin back in 2021 and transported to its remote location. Demin has shared a series of renderings of the unique property, which will be available to rent from April. Featuring two bedrooms and a swimming pool, the Private Jet Villa by Hanging Gardens, which sits 150 meters above sea level, is available to rent from April, with nightly rates starting at around $7,000.  Jet turned villa Demin, also the owner of the Bubble Hotel Bali hotel chain, says that he initially considered purchasing a private plane for personal use, but quickly saw the potential to transform the aircraft into something truly special. \u201cEven before buying it, I thought that it was possible to convert it into some kind of unique object, and decided to concentrate on creating a villa,\u201d he says, before explaining that he found 20 or so similar planes located around Indonesia alone while searching. Denim eventually settled on a Boeing 737 that had been bought by an Indonesia investor and agreed to purchase it. However, transporting the aircraft from its location in Bali to a clifftop several miles away was no easy task. \u201cWe had to take it apart after consulting with the Boeing team,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe\u2019ve loosened 50,000 bolts.\u201d According to Demin, who has been living in Bali for around eight years, the entire process took around two months of planning, while the actual transportation, which involved two cranes, a huge platform, various specialists and a police escort, lasted a total of five days.  \u201cIt was the most sleepless five days of my life,\u201d he says, adding that much of the operation took place at night. Precarious position \u201cThe fact is that Bali has very narrow roads and a lot of wires that hang quite low,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had a group of people who used special equipment to raise the wires higher so that the plane would not touch them during transportation.\u201d  Once the plane was re-assembled at the site on the southernmost coast of Bali, he was able to strip out much of the inside to complete the lengthy renovation work. Demin says he went to great lengths to ensure that the interior matched his original vision. \u201cI want people to experience the \u2018wow effect\u2019 from every second of being in this unusual place,\u201d he says. The villa can be accessed via a staircase leading up along the wing to the main entrance.  Inside, there\u2019s a living room with a bar, a sofa bed and a glass portal, as well as two bedrooms with walk-in closets. The cockpit has been converted into a large bathroom, with additional portholes added so those inside can see \u201coverboard.\u201d The property also has sun loungers, an outdoor lounge area and a fire pit. \u201cEverything was done for the single purpose to get exactly the picture that was originally planned,\u201d adds Demin. Social media sensation The unique project has been garnering a lot of attention on social media since it was first unveiled, which has led to some rather unusual incidents on the ground. \u201cOne day I came and saw a broken fence and 150 people sitting on our plane,\u201d says Demin, before describing how a paraglider once jumped from the plane\u2019s wing. While Demin stresses that the aircraft has been through numerous safety checks, its precarious position, as well as the various images shared of influencers walking along the wing or with their legs hanging out of the plane door have certainly raised eyebrows. Demin explains that a barrier has been installed on the rock for safety purposes. But he says he\u2019s had trouble recruiting someone to install a glass barrier on a wing positioned over a cliff. \u201cThe major issue is the glass barrier along the contour of the wing itself and along the contour of the rock,\u201d he says, admitting that \u201ceveryone is afraid to do it.\u201d  \u201cThere are certain difficulties with this, in particular, with the wing. But we will do it anyway, as soon as we find someone who is brave enough to implement it.\u201d  After years of painstaking work on the project, Demin is hugely looking forward to finally welcoming guests to the private jet villa, which is on schedule to open its doors in April. It comes a year after a decommissioned British Airways jet was reborn as a unique events space for hire based at the privately owned Cotswold Airport in the UK. Meanwhile, the Jumbo Stay Hotel, a former Boeing 747 turned hostel/hotel, opened near Arlanda Airport in Stockholm, Sweden in 2009.

            "text": "Shares in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company fell as much as 4% on Wednesday, after Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had sold most of its holdings in the chip giant. In a Tuesday filing with the United States\u2019 Securities and Exchange Commission, Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKA) said it had about 8.3 million American depository shares of TSMC worth $618 million, having sold 86% of its shares. Just months before, in November, the company held about 60 million American depository shares of TSMC worth $4.1 billion, according to an SEC filing. Berkshire Hathaway did not provide a reason for the sale and did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. TSMC had no comment on the share sale. Shares in TSMC, which accounts for an estimated 90% of the world\u2019s super-advanced computer chips, ended Wednesday more than 3% lower. Last month, the chipmaker posted strong quarterly and annual earnings, but gave a muted forecast on prospects for 2023 given the global slump in electronics demand because of rising inflation. Due to TSMC\u2019s record earnings in 2022, its board approved on Tuesday the distribution of $121 billion New Taiwan Dollars ($4 billion) in performance-related bonuses and profit sharing to employees based in Taiwan. With nearly 65,000 employees on the island as of the end of last year, that would work out as an average of $62,000 per employee \u2013 if distributed equally.  Global expansion The board also approved a plan to inject up to $3.5 billion into the company\u2019s subsidiary in Arizona, which will be part of a previously announced investment of $40 billion in the United States. TSMC announced last year that it\u2019s building a second semiconductor factory in Phoenix and increasing its investment there.  The world\u2019s most important chipmaker, highly sought after by governments globally, is considering opening its first plant in Europe and a second one in Japan. TSMC\u2019s global expansion comes as political tension has heightened between Washington and Beijing. Earlier this month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed a planned trip to China in response to the flying of a suspected Chinese spy balloon over the United States. In October, President Joe Biden\u2019s administration imposed sweeping new curbs designed to curtail China\u2019s access to technology critical to its growing military power. Last month, a Dutch maker of semiconductor equipment, ASML, told CNN that \u201crules are being finalized\u201d on export controls to China, amid reports that the Netherlands and Japan have joined the United States in restricting sales of some computer chip machinery to the country. A few days later, multiple media outlets reported that Washington was moving to further restrict sales of American technology to Chinese tech giant Huawei. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore and Michelle Toh contributed to this report",

            "text": "Boeing announced one of the largest orders in its history Tuesday. But it was still topped by rival Airbus. Both aircraft makers announced massive orders from Air India, which is gearing up its own expansion plans.  Boeing\u2019s order, which was announced by President Joe Biden after a call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was for 220 firm jet orders: 190 of Boeing 737 Max single-aisle planes, 20 of 787 Dreamliners widebodies and 10 of 777X, the newest version of its widebody now undergoing the certification process. It\u2019s the third biggest sale of all time for Boeing. But Airbus announced orders for 250 jets, including 140 A320neo and 70 A321neo single-aisle planes, along with 34 A350-1000 and six A350-900 widebodies. It\u2019s a sign of the competitive disadvantage that Boeing still finds itself facing, especially in selling narrow-body, single-aisle jets, a segment of the market that Airbus continues to dominate. Boeing has been narrowing the gap with Airbus in orders, helped especially by an even larger order from United late last year. For all of 2022, Boeing announced a total of 808 net commercial aircraft orders, up from 535 a year earlier. But Airbus edged it out with 820 orders. Boeing has had a particularly hard couple of years. It experienced a 20-month grounding of its best-selling 737 Max following two fatal crashes, with rising trade tensions between China and the United States leading to a virtual halt in sales to China, the world\u2019s largest market for plane sales, and of course the pandemic.  But even in 2018, when Boeing reported record sales revenue, it trailed Airbus by about 200 net jet orders for the year. Outlook for aircraft orders improving The good news for Boeing is that aircraft manufacturing is essentially split between the two companies, and there\u2019s a long backlog of orders at both. Boeing had a backlog of nearly 4,600 jets on its books at the end of January. And as the Air India order demonstrates, global airlines are starting to gear up to make new purchases as they climb out of years of losses caused by the plunge in demand during the pandemic.  Global air traffic is expected to boom this year, returning to pre-pandemic levels in June, according to a new report from aircraft leasing company Avolon.  And the global airline industry is expected to return to profitability this year for the first time since 2019, according to the International Air Transport Association. The US industry already returned to profitability in 2022. Boeing\u2019s Air India order was valued at a list price of $34 billion. Airbus no longer publishes a list price for its aircraft, but its most recent list price from 2018 would have valued its Air India order at nearly $38 billion. Airlines do not pay full list prices for commercial jets, especially when placing an order this large. But even at a discount of 50%, which is not unusual, Boeing\u2019s Air India order would mean a sale valued at $17 billion.  That\u2019s an important lift to a company still struggling to recover from the plunge in revenue and financial losses it suffered over the last four years. Boeing\u2019s 2022 revenue came in at $66.6 billion, up $8 billion from the trough in sales in 2020, but far lower than its record 2018 revenue of $101 billion before the grounding. Boeing gets most of its sales revenue once a plane is delivered, and the 777X has yet to be built. The planes in this order are years away from delivery.  The Air India purchase also includes an option that allows it to buy an additional 50 Boeing 737 Max\u2019s and 20 Boeing 787s, totaling 290 airplanes. At list price, that order would be valued at $45.9 billion. Biden touts order In a statement, Biden said the sale would \u201csupport over one million American jobs across 44 states, and many will not require a four-year college degree.\u201d  \u201cThis announcement also reflects the strength of the U.S.-India economic partnership,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cTogether with Prime Minister Modi, I look forward to deepening our partnership even further as we continue to confront shared global challenges \u2014 creating a more secure and prosperous future for all of our citizens.\u201d  Production will support three separate U.S.-based manufacturing lines, have a total economic impact of $70 billion across the United States and support an estimated 1.47 million direct and indirect jobs, a White House official said Tuesday. India\u2019s growing economic might India has been gaining some manufacturing business as Western tensions flare with China, including major companies that traditionally rely heavily on Chinese production. Apple is one such company, with Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal saying the tech giant was already making between 5% and 7% of its products in India.  India is set to overtake China this year to become the world\u2019s most populous country. The country\u2019s massive and cheap labor force, which includes workers with key technical skills, is a big draw for manufacturers. Asia\u2019s third-largest economy also offers a growing domestic market. In 2023, as global recession fears persist, India is expected to remain the fastest growing major economy in the world. If it can sustain that momentum, India could become only the third country with GDP worth $10 trillion by 2035, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research, after the US and China.  Boeing woes Boeing\u2019s\n            \n                (BA) 737 Max has been plagued with problems, but production and orders for the troubled aircraft has picked up, boosted by an even larger order from United late last year. In June, Ethiopian Airlines took delivery of a 737 Max from Boeing for the first time since the March 2019 crash that killed all 157 people on board, and led to a 20-month grounding of the jet.  The company has plenty of other troubles in China, the world\u2019s largest aviation market. It has been on the verge of being virtually shut out of the region as trade tensions between the United States and China have basically halted Boeing sales in the country for the last four years.  The company has not announced any sales to a Chinese passenger airline since November 2017, and the country banned the Boeing 737 Max for much longer than most countries. In January, a Boeing 737 Max took off in China for the first time since 2019.  Boeing has faced myriad problems in recent years, beyond the drop in demand for passenger planes that occurred during the pandemic. Delivery of the 787 Dreamliner widebody jets resumed last year after they were halted due to quality control issues.",

            "title": "Ram reveals its electric truck and it looks just like the gas truck",
            "text": "Ram revealed the production version of its electric pickup in a Super Bowl commercial, and it turns out that it looks much like today\u2019s internal combustion powered Ram 1500 truck, instead of the futuristic concept unveiled just last month.  Stellantis, Ram\u2019s parent company, had previously revealed a sleek looking concept truck that was said to provide a preview of the the brand\u2019s first electric pickup. But the Ram 1500 Rev, due out in late 2024, looks almost exactly like a gas-powered Ram 1500 pickup, except for its headlights and taillights. The Ram 1500 Revolution concept truck had an extra long cab containing a folding third row of seats, something not found in other trucks. And, according to Stellantis, Ram\u2019s parent company, the back wall of the passenger cabin could fold down, allowing an opening from the cargo bed into the cab for carrying large items. That\u2019s a feature that will be available in General Motors\u2019 Chevrolet and GMC electric trucks which were revealed last year. The RamRev.com website, where people can reserve the truck that\u2019s due to go into production in late 2024, does not describe features like that. The design approach for the Ram 1500 Rev is similar to that of the Ford F-150 Lightning, which looks very similar to the gas-powered F-150, except for distinctive front and rear lights. The Lightning has a patterned area on the front that resembles a grille, though, while the Ram Rev has a clear covering over RAM lettering that lights up. Both the F-150 Lightning and Ram Rev are engineered like traditional pickups with strong but flexible metal frames and batteries that are carried inside the frame. GM\u2019s pickups are based on that company\u2019s Ultium platform, a skateboard-like design that underpins all of GM\u2019s new electric vehicles including crossover SUVs and trucks. The vehicles are built on a more rigid platform resembling an ice tray that holds varying numbers of battery packs.  The GM truck\u2019s very different underlying engineering allows for distinctive body designs. GM\u2019s trucks, for instance, don\u2019t have a break between the passenger cabin and the cargo bed because there\u2019s less need to allow for a frame to twist and flex. Therefore, their trucks have a sleeker design. In profile, the back of the passenger cabins on GM\u2019s trucks slope down to the side of the bed rather than the two parts meeting at a sharp right angle. Various automakers also differ, generally, on how different they should make their electric vehicles from gas-powered models. Some feel that customers will want these new vehicles to seem as familiar as possible, and they don\u2019t want anything that looks too strange. Others, like GM, have designed their electric vehicles to look very different from their gas models. All three electric trucks, Ford\u2019s, GM\u2019s, and Ram\u2019s, will have a \u201cfrunk,\u201d or front trunk, for storage. Startup EV truck maker Rivian also has a frunk in it\u2019s R1T pickup, but it\u2019s more of a hole into which things can be placed from above rather than being open from the front as in the other trucks. Stellantis did not provide any specifications for the new electric truck such as power, driving range or other capabilities. The commercial played on the idea of disappointing range and towing abilities of electric trucks. Stellantis chief executive Stellantis executives have said in the past that the Ram electric truck would be available in a version with an on-board \u201crange extender,\u201d a gas-powered engine that would generate electricity for longer drives so the truck wouldn\u2019t have to stop to recharge.  Executives, including Stellantis chief executive Carlos Tavares, have also said that the Ram Rev will exceed other trucks on the market in its capabilities and range when it comes onto the market. For now, Stellantis spokesperson Todd Goyer declined to provide any further information on the Ram Rev beyond what\u2019s currently available.",

            "text": "Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has sold its remaining stake in Paytm, India\u2019s top digital payment app, as it gradually divests from its Indian investments amid friction between Beijing and New Delhi. Alibaba.com Singapore E-commerce Private Ltd sold 21.43 million shares of One 97 Communications, the parent company of Paytm, at 642.74 rupees apiece, according to Friday data from India\u2019s National Stock Exchange (NSE). The deal is worth about 13.77 billion rupees ($167 million), according to CNN calculations. In January, Alibaba sold about 3% of Paytm for $125 million, cutting its holdings from 6.26%, based on NSE data. With Friday\u2019s deal, it has sold its entire direct stake in Paytm. Shares in One 97 Communications plunged nearly 8% on Friday. It bounced back slightly on Monday morning. Alibaba and Paytm didn\u2019t immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. \u2018India\u2019s Alipay\u2019 Founded in 2010, Paytm is India\u2019s largest payment platform, with more than 300 million registered customers and over 20 million merchants. It\u2019s backed by big name investors such as Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba, Softbank\n            \n                (SFTBF) and Warrent Buffet\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKA). Alibaba and Ant Group together made a \u201cstrategic\u201d investment in Paytm in September 2015, in an extension of the initial investment made by Ant in February of that year.  At that point, Alibaba said the investment would enhance its ability to tap opportunities in India\u2019s fast-growing mobile commerce market and digital finance industry. Paytm and Ant Group had been working on \u201csynergies\u201d since Ant made the initial investment, the company said. Ant Group, which operates China\u2019s leading digital payment app Alipay, remains Paytm\u2019s largest shareholder with a 25% stake, according to the most recent data from Refinitiv Eikon.  Alibaba has gradually exited its investments in India, after New Delhi imposed restrictions in 2020 that made it difficult for Chinese investors to invest in Indian firms. China and India share a disputed border that has long been the source of friction between New Delhi and Beijing, with tensions escalating sharply in June 2020, when hand-to-hand fighting between the two sides in the Himalayas resulted in the deaths of at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers. Last December, Indian and Chinese troops clashed again along the border, which at the time was the first known incident between the two nuclear-armed Asian powers in nearly two years \u2014 though video later emerged suggesting a previously unreported clash occurred in 2021. In early 2021, Alibaba sold a major stake in BigBasket, an online grocery retailer, to Indian conglomerate Tata Group. In May 2022,  Alibaba and Ant Group offloaded their entire stake in Paytm Mall, the e-commerce platform of Paytm. In November 2022, Ant Group reportedly sold a stake of about 3% in Zomato for $200 million, according to Reuters. Alibaba itself has also been under pressure from domestic regulatory crackdowns and economic headwinds. A government campaign aimed at reining in the country\u2019s technology giants, coupled with a weak economy, has sharply slowed sales growth at the company, battered its share price and made business expansion more difficult.  Last year, Alibaba posted flat revenue growth for the first time since going public in 2014.",

            "text": "It\u2019s the airline that came back from the dead \u2013 and then died again. When British regional airline Flybe went bust on January 28, its clients could have been forgiven for wondering if they had deja vu. It was the second time in three years that the airline had folded. Flybe first went under in March 2020, but relaunched two years later with UK domestic and international routes, before folding again after just 10 months. Just three days later, another airline went bankrupt. Flyr \u2013 a Norwegian airline \u2013 had launched only last year. \u201cIf you look at the number of airlines that have gone out of business, it\u2019s staggering \u2013 and there have been major impacts across a massive number of airlines,\u201d says Steve Ehrlich, chairman of Pilots Together, a charity founded during the pandemic to help pilots who had been laid off. \u201cThe pandemic exposed some of the weaknesses [in airlines] that we might not have seen for some time.\u201d   Prices up, airlines down   2023 has been touted as the year travel finally returns to normal after three years that saw the industry on its knees.  But just when you thought it was safe to get back in the air, the airline bankruptcies have returned.  At the same time, prices are up. Economy fares have increased by an average of 36% for 2023, according to data from Flight Centre, a UK-based booking agency.  Flying to certain destinations has become impossible if you\u2019re on a budget. Fares to New Zealand, for example, have increased 81% year on year, they say, while flights to South Africa from the UK are up by 42% in economy and 70% in business. Of course, there\u2019s context for both destinations. In February 2022, New Zealand was closed and while South Africa was at the center of the Omicron variant.  Overall, bookings are still down \u2013 by 22% globally for the first quarter of 2023, compared to 2019, according to ForwardKeys, who analyze data from the International Air Transport Association ticketing database \u2013 in other words, the world\u2019s legacy carriers. The Caribbean is suffering the least \u2013 just 3% down on 2019 bookings \u2013 while Asia Pacific is still lagging at 46% down.  In between are the Middle East (down 5%), Americas (9%), Europe (15%) and Africa (18%).  That\u2019s not set to last, however. Olivier Ponti, ForwardKeys\u2019 vice president of insights, says that he\u2019s \u201ccautiously optimistic that the summer season will be extremely busy\u201d \u2013 as long as external factors don\u2019t intervene.   From billionaires to millionaires   Airlines failing is nothing new, of course. There\u2019s an old adage that the best way to become a millionaire is to start an airline\u2026 as a billionaire. But the pandemic has been more damaging to the aviation sector than recessions, wars or terrorist incidents. Since 2020, no fewer than 64 airlines have ceased operations, according to aviation website and podcast AllPlane.tv, which has been keeping a tally as they go.  A handful have revived after announcing bankruptcy, or changed names, but the vast majority are gone for good.    And while the average traveler might not recognize names such as Jet Time, NokScoot or Fly My Sky, some big names went under in the pandemic, too \u2013 for starters, Alitalia, Italy\u2019s former national airline. (The country now has a successor: ITA Airways.) Air Namibia \u2013 another national flag-carrier \u2013 also went under in 2021. \u201cI was surprised to see the Alitalia brand go \u2013 not because it was in a healthy state, it had been a financial basket case for so long, but because nevertheless it had carried on and on,\u201d says Miquel Ros, AllPlane\u2019s founder and editor. Ros is sanguine about the bankruptcies. To him, despite the numbers, the pandemic has been less of a Grim Reaper, scything through the world\u2019s airlines, and more a jolt to the industry that made already sputtering engines finally cut out. \u201cIt prompted many airlines that were in a delicate financial situation to give up,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of those that failed in 2020 were likely to have gone out of business anyway, just a bit later. Many were either airlines that had had issues for quite some time, or fragile ventures that lacked the scale and scope to compete with large operators.\u201d Ros started keeping track of airline bankruptcies in 2018, when 18 global airlines went bust. In 2019, that number rocketed to 34. Again, they were largely smaller airlines \u2013 remember Curacao operator Insel Air, anyone? Its fleet of three Fokkers couldn\u2019t keep up against the big players. In 2018, Kuwait\u2019s Wataniya Airways even did a Flybe and folded twice. In comparison, the figures from the pandemic don\u2019t look quite so bad. 2020 saw the loss of 31 airlines, 2021 took 19 out of action, and by 2022 that had dropped to just 12. However, with three failures already, 2023 looks unlikely to be plain sailing.     A lucky escape  For Murdo Morrison, head of strategic content at FlightGlobal, it\u2019s \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d that more airlines didn\u2019t collapse during the pandemic. \u201cThe ones that have gone pretty much would all have gone anyway,\u201d he says. \u201cSince airlines began, there\u2019s always been a churn. It\u2019s a business with high risks, it\u2019s historically been hard to make money, and it\u2019s very hard to get the business model right. Look at Flybe \u2013 its first collapse [March 5, 2020] was, really, before the pandemic. They weren\u2019t making enough money because their business model wasn\u2019t right. That\u2019s probably why they went out of business second time round.\u201d In fact, Morrison says, most airlines were saved from destruction by governments \u201cputting their airline industries into hibernation, paying their fixed costs and most of the wage bill. They were able to let people go and reduce the cost structure, so though there was no revenue there were lower costs. Very few airlines went under as a direct result of the pandemic.\u201d He adds that the past three years have seen a \u201clot of launches,\u201d too. Of course, of those newbies, Flybe\u2019s second iteration and Flyr are already out of the picture. But it\u2019s not all good news. \u201cThe biggest problem has been the recovery \u2013 last summer, airports just couldn\u2019t cope with the bounceback in passenger numbers,\u201d he says. \u201cAirlines and airports were unwilling or unable to resource back-up in late 2021 and early 2022 after cutting their costs, and that\u2019s what caused the summer of chaos. There weren\u2019t enough baggage handlers. Weren\u2019t enough security screeners. In some cases there weren\u2019t enough pilots.\u201d  Following the USA   If you\u2019ve flown in the US, you\u2019ll know that choosing your airline is a simpler process than in other parts of the world. Where in Asia or Europe there are dozens of airlines, both legacy companies and start-ups, vying for your business, in the US there are the \u201cbig four\u201d: American, Delta, Southwest and United. That\u2019s the model that the rest of the world are moving towards as a result of the pandemic, says Pere Suau-Sanchez, senior lecturer in air transport management at the UK\u2019s Cranfield University and the Open University of Catalonia in Spain. \u201cIn Europe, we have more players in our market, they\u2019re generally smaller and they\u2019re generally specialized in terms of geography \u2013 so they\u2019re more subject to external forces,\u201d he says.   For him, the bankruptcies are \u201cpart of a general trend of consolidation\u201d along US lines. In future, you can expect to see \u201cwhat seems like fewer airlines\u201d \u2013 or regional airlines merging under the same umbrella organization. In Europe, Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, Level and Vueling are already all owned by IAG, for example. Suau-Sanchez thinks this will become more common, with the individual airline names kept on more as \u201cbranding to tap into national markets\u201d than showing any real difference.  Regional airports have taken a hit during the pandemic, too, he warns, with airlines concentrating on larger hubs to accelerate recovery. Business travel has taken a huge hit \u2013 and business travelers en route to different cities are core clients for regional airports. \u201cWhen the market is small, losing a few passengers can be a major problem,\u201d he says.   Turbulence ahead   So what does the future hold? Suau-Sanchez thinks fare increases of up to 25% will continue for the \u201cfor a few years,\u201d as airlines need recovery money, fuel prices increase, and the aviation industry invests in sustainable technology. For Morrison, European shorthaul has already stabilized, with decent fares. \u201cDemand is pretty robust, competition is high, and the market is functioning,\u201d he says. Long haul, though \u201ctook a bit more of a battering.\u201d Airlines have yet to restore their pre-pandemic flight schedules \u2013 and that means fewer planes and fewer seats.  \u201cIt comes down to supply and demand \u2013 at the moment the high prices are to do with demand coming back quicker than supply. They can charge a premium for flights, and at the moment longhaul fares are a lot higher than 2019,\u201d he says.  On the plus side, he believes that it won\u2019t be forever: \u201cAll being equal, fares will go down. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019ll be able to fly from London to New York for \u00a3200 return but I think prices will come down \u2013 but over what period I don\u2019t know.\u201d In the meantime, Flybe\u2019s administrators look as if they might get a temporary operating license from the UK\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority. Lufthansa and Air France-KLM are said to be nosing around the company. If it\u2019s round three for the airline, perhaps it\u2019ll be third time lucky.",

The electronic components will be made in GlobalFoundries facilities in upstate New York.  Semiconductors are a major component of electronic parts such as the computer modules that are required to make automobiles. Disruptions in supplies of computer parts, such as microchips or semiconductors, have caused problems with auto manufacturing in recent years, leading to reduced supplies of new vehicles and high prices for new cars, trucks and SUVs.  GM\u2019s direct relationship with GlobalFoundries will give the automaker a secure supply of chips and will help control costs, said CEO Thomas Caulfield. GM will not have to pay mark-ups to its parts suppliers for semiconducter manufacturing. It\u2019s an unusual agreement in that GM is contracting directly with a firm that will supply manufacturing services to companies that, in turn, provide parts to GM. Under this agreement, the various electronic component manufacturers that make parts for GM will use GlobalFoundries to make semiconductors for them.  As a manufacturer, GlobalFoundries can make semiconductors of any design for a variety of different customers, said Caulfield. \u201cIt\u2019s capacity they want on technology they want, where they want it at the best economics,\u201d Caulfield said in an interview with CNN.  GlobalFoundries announced last July that it would expand its manufacturing capabilities around the company\u2019s Malta, New York, headquarters.  The company also has semiconductor manufacturing capabilities elsewhere in the US including Essex Junction, Vermont, and in other parts of the world such as Germany and Singapore.  Last summer, the federal government passed legislation to boost computer chip manufacturing in the United States so companies could import fewer computer components from China. The agreement is also part of an overall plan by GM\n            \n                (GM) to reduce the number of different chips needed to build GM\n            \n                (GM) vehicles. GM\n            \n                (GM)\u2019s stock rose 2% this morning. \u201cThe supply agreement with GlobalFoundries will help establish a strong, resilient supply of critical technology in the U.S. that will help GM meet this demand, while delivering new technology and features to our customers,\u201d Doug Parks, GM executive vice president in charge of purchasing and supply chain, said in an announcement.  The companies declined to say how much money or how many semiconductors are involved in the agreement. They also did not say how long the agreement is for beyond describing it as \u201clong term.\u201d",

            "title": "What\u2019s the safest seat on a plane? We asked an aviation expert",
            "text": "When booking a flight, do you ever think about which seat will protect you the most in an emergency? Probably not. Most people book seats for comfort, such as leg room, or convenience, such as easy access to toilets. Frequent fliers (this author included) might book their seat as close as possible to the front so they can disembark more quickly. We rarely book a flight with hopes of getting one of the middle seats in the last row. Well, guess what? These seats are statistically the safest ones on an airplane. Air travel is safe Before we get into it, I should reiterate that air travel is the safest mode of transport. In 2019, there were just under 70 million flights globally, with only 287 fatalities. According to the US National Safety Council\u2019s analysis of census data, the odds of dying in a plane are about 1 in 205,552, compared with 1 in 102 in a car. Even so, we pay little attention to fatal road accidents, but when we hear about an ATR72 crashing in Nepal it\u2019s the lead story on every news page. Our interest in plane crashes might lie in wanting to understand why they happen, or what the odds are of them happening again. And perhaps it\u2019s not a bad thing; our concern ensures these tragic incidents are thoroughly investigated, which helps keep air travel safe. Frankly speaking, there is no real need to worry about safety when you board a commercial flight. But if you\u2019ve still got that nagging question in your head, driven by sheer curiosity, read on.  In the middle, at the back It\u2019s worth remembering accidents by their very nature do not conform to standards. In the 1989 United Flight 232 crash in Sioux City, Iowa, 184 of the 269 people on board survived the accident. Most of the survivors were sitting behind first class, towards the front of the plane. Nonetheless, a TIME investigation that looked at 35 years of aircraft accident data found the middle rear seats of an aircraft had the lowest fatality rate: 28%, compared with 44% for the middle aisle seats. This logically makes sense too. Sitting next to an exit row will always provide you with the fastest exit in the case of an emergency, granted there\u2019s no fire on that side. But the wings of a plane store fuel, so this disqualifies the middle exit rows as the safest row option. At the same time, being closer to the front means you\u2019ll be impacted before those in the back, which leaves us with the last exit row. As for why the middle seats are safer than the window or aisle seats, that is, as you might expect, because of the buffer provided by having people on either side.  Some emergencies are worse than others The type of emergency will also dictate survivability. Running into a mountain will decrease chances of survival exponentially, as was the case in a tragic 1979 disaster in New Zealand. Air New Zealand Flight TE901 crashed into the slopes of Mt Erebus in Antarctica, killing 257 passengers and crew. Landing in the ocean nose-first also decreases chances of survival, as witnessed with the 2009 Air France Flight 447, in which 228 passengers and crew perished. Pilots are trained to minimize potential risk in an emergency event as best as they can. They will try to avoid hitting mountains and look for a level place, such as an open field, to land as normally as possible. The technique for landing in water requires assessing the surface conditions and attempting to land between waves at a normal landing angle. Aircraft are designed to be very robust in emergency situations. In fact, the main reason the cabin crew remind us to keep our seat belts fastened is not because of crash risk, but because of \u201cclear air turbulence\u201d that can be experienced at any time at high altitudes. It is this weather phenomenon that can cause the most damage to passengers and aircraft. Manufacturers are designing new planes with more composite materials capable of handing in-flight stress. In these designs, the wings are not rigid and can flex to absorb extreme loading to prevent structural failure. Does the type of plane make a difference? Granted, there are certain variables, such as impact from airspeed, that can vary slightly between different airplane types. However, the physics of flight is more or less the same in all planes. Generally, larger planes will have more structural material and therefore more strength to withstand pressurization at altitude. This means they may provide some additional protection in an emergency \u2013 but this, again, is highly dependent on the severity of the emergency. That\u2019s not to say you should book your next flight on the largest plane you can find. As I\u2019ve mentioned, air travel remains very safe. So I\u2019d suggest thinking about what movie you\u2019ll watch instead, and hoping they don\u2019t run out of chicken and only have the shrimp left! Top image: An airplane cabin interior.

Although Boeing will reduce office staff, the company is preparing to add 10,000 employees focused on engineering and manufacturing. The company said that job cuts will be accomplished through a combination of attrition and layoffs. Boeing said that the employees who will be laid off have yet to be notified. Some of work conducted by the staff being let go will be contracted out to Tata Consulting Services in Bengaluru, India, while other work will be eliminated through streamlining and simplifying processes. \u201cWe have and will continue to communicate transparently with our teams that we expect lower staffing within some corporate support functions so that we can focus our resources in engineering and manufacturing and directly supporting our products, services and technology development efforts,\u201d said the company in a statement. \u201cAs always, we will support affected teammates and provide assistance and resources to support their transition.\u201d Boeing announced several rounds of job cuts that reduced staffing by 20,000 employees to 141,000 during 2020 as the pandemic caused demand for aircraft to fall sharply. Many customers canceled orders for planes, most notably the 737 Max, which remained grounded for most of the year following fatal crashes in late 2018 and early 2019.  But Boeing grew its workforce by 15,000 last year, bringing employment back to 156,000. And it said it plans to hire another 10,000 engineering and manufacturing employees this year.",

United removed an important safety measure \u2014 checking the fire warning system \u2014 from its list of actions that crews must complete before each flight of the 777s, the Federal Aviation Administration said Monday. The airline failed to make the fire-warning checks between June 2018 and April 2021, according to the agency. \u201cThe inspection is required in the maintenance specifications manual\u201d of the Boeing-made 777s, the FAA said in a statement. \u201cRemoval of the check resulted in United\u2019s failure to perform the required check and the operation of aircraft that did not meet airworthiness requirements.\u201d United called the check \u201credundant\u201d and said a 2018 change to its procedures dropping the fire system inspection was approved by the FAA at the time. The airline said it \u201cimmediately updated its procedures\u201d when the FAA later said the check must be performed by the pilots.   \u201cThe safety of our flights was never in question,\u201d the airline said in a statement.  An official familiar with the matter said the fire-system check was dropped when United consolidated its procedures for the 777 and 787.  A 787 computer performs the check automatically, the official said.  United, in its statement, said the check is now also \u201cperformed automatically by the 777.\u201d  A $1.1 million fine would be a pittance for a major airline like United, which had $7.2 billion in cash on its balance sheet at the end of last year \u2014  enough to pay the fine 6,500 times over.

            "title": "SpaceX put a Tesla sportscar into space five years ago. Where is it now?",
            "text": "It\u2019s now been half a decade since SpaceX turned heads around the world with its decision to launch Elon Musk\u2019s personal Tesla roadster into outer space, sending the car on an endless journey into the cosmic wilderness where it\u2019s expected to remain for millennia to come. As of Monday, February 6, the cherry-colored sports car has officially been in space for exactly five years.  At the time of its anniversary, data estimates show that it had completed about three and one quarter loops around the sun and was positioned about 203 million miles (327 million kilometers) from Earth, according to the tracking website whereisroadster.com. The roadster has logged more than 2.5 billion miles in space (4 billion kilometers), mostly through a barren vacuum. Though, in 2020, the vehicle made its first close approach to Mars, passing within 5 million miles of the planet, or about 20 times the distance between the Earth and the moon.  It is difficult, however, to say where the vehicle is with absolute certainty \u2014 or to determine if it\u2019s still in one piece, as it\u2019s possible the car may have been dinged or obliterated by a meteoroid or eroded beyond recognition by radiation. There haven\u2019t been any direct observations of the roadster since 2018, in the weeks just after it was blasted into orbit atop a three-million-pound Falcon Heavy rocket. Current data is based only on calculated estimates of the car\u2019s trajectory. Astronomers don\u2019t have much incentive to actively track the car, as it doesn\u2019t offer much scientific value. The Tesla was ultimately intended to serve as a throw-away \u201cdummy payload\u201d for the Falcon Heavy\u2019s first mission in February 2018, a launch that even Musk had predicted would have only a 50-50 shot at success. But the launch did, after all, go off without a hitch. And the car has been circling the sun ever since, taking an oblong path that swings as far out as Mars\u2019 orbital path and as close to the sun as Earth\u2019s orbit. As of Monday, it was just intersecting with Mars\u2019 path, though the planet itself was on the opposite side of the sun. Before its 2018 launch, SpaceX loaded up the car with various Easter eggs. Behind the wheel was a spacesuit-clad mannequin, nicknamed Starman, and on the dashboard, a sign that read \u201cDon\u2019t Panic,\u201d a reference to the famed science fiction story, \u201cThe Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy.\u201d There was also a data storage device loaded with the works of sci-fi writer Isaac Asminov and a plaque inscribed with the names of thousands of SpaceX employees. Musk said at the time of launch that he hoped humans will one day establish settlements on other planets in the solar system  \u2014 a long-running Musk fantasy that also underpins SpaceX\u2019s stated mission to colonize Mars. If and when that happens, Musk said he hopes his \u201cdescendants will be able to drag (the roadster) back to a museum.\u201d For now, however, the roadster isn\u2019t likely to pass near another planet until 2035 when it\u2019ll brush by Mars again. It\u2019ll then make two passes within a few million miles of Earth in 2047 and 2050, according to NASA data. One 2018 academic paper also estimated that the chances the car collides with the Earth within the next 15 million years at about 22%. The odds of it crashing into Venus or the Sun each stand at 12%. If the car does wind up taking a crash course with Earth, we\u2019ll have to hope it\u2019s ripped into pieces as it slams back into the thick atmosphere. (Spaceborne objects running into Earth are actually fairly common, and typically burn up in the atmosphere during entry. Such hits rarely impact populated areas.)  To keep tabs on the roadster\u2019s predicted location, it has its own entry in NASA\u2019s Horizons database, which follows all the \u201cbodies\u201d of the solar system, including exploration probes, planets, moons, comets and asteroids. The Tesla is listed as object -143205, \u201cSpaceX Roadster (spacecraft) (Tesla).\u201d To view a simulation of the Tesla\u2019s orbit (based on the data in Horizons), go to OrbitSimulator.com and search for \u201croadster.\u201d",

            "text": "Apple supplier Foxconn says its January monthly sales hit a record high as it bounced back from Covid-19 disruptions in China. In a sales update on Sunday, the Taiwanese manufacturing giant reported revenue of 660.4 billion Taiwan dollars ($22 billion) in January, 48% more than the same period a year ago and its highest-ever level for that month. Revenue was up nearly 5% compared to the previous month. The manufacturer attributed its performance to a strong rebound at its sprawling campus in Zhengzhou, central China.  The site, which is home to the world\u2019s biggest iPhone factory, was crippled late last year by Covid-19 restrictions and workers\u2019 protests. Now, operations there are \u201creturning to normal,\u201d and product shipments have jumped, Foxconn said. The company also said a \u201cbetter components supply\u201d helped boost sales.  Two of Foxconn\u2019s most-watched divisions: smart consumer electronics, which includes smartphones and televisions, and computing products, which includes laptops and tablets, both \u201cshowed strong double-digit growth,\u201d it said. The figures underscore how Foxconn\u2019s Zhengzhou campus, also known as \u201ciPhone city,\u201d is roaring back to life after the massive setbacks. The company\u2019s troubles started in October, when workers left the site because of concerns about Covid-related working conditions and shortages of food. Short on staff, bonuses were later offered to workers to return. But violent protests broke out in November, when newly-hired staff said management had reneged on their promises. Workers clashed with security officers, before the company eventually offered them cash to quit and leave the site. The headaches had led analysts to predict that Apple would likely speed up its supply chain diversification away from China. Last week, Apple\n            \n                (AAPL) pointed to challenges in China as a key factor in its worse-than-expected earnings. CEO Tim Cook said the company\u2019s problems in the country had hurt its supply of the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max during the key holiday shopping season. Foxconn has since managed to stabilize operations at its facility. Last month, Chinese state media reported that the Zhengzhou plant was almost back to normal, reaching 90% of capacity as of the end of December.  The company also expressed confidence for the road ahead. On Sunday, it said in a statement that its outlook for the first quarter would likely meet analysts\u2019 expectations, without providing specifics. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expect the firm\u2019s revenue to grow 4% during the January-to-March period. Foxconn\u2019s shares rose 1.9% in Taipei on Monday. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Wayne Chang and Juliana Liu contributed to this report.",

            "text": "For decades she\u2019s been dubbed \u201cqueen of the skies\u201d and now it\u2019s official \u2013 kind of. The last Boeing 747 to ever be produced traced the shape of a crown in the sky as she made her maiden flight.  Cargo operator Atlas Air took delivery of the jumbo jet on Tuesday, in a ceremony that was livestreamed online to avgeeks around the world.  The aircraft left Boeing\u2019s plant in Everett, Washington, and flew to Cincinnati the following day.  During the seven-hour flight, the pilots took the chance to \u201cdraw\u201d the crown in the sky, along with a \u201c747\u201d nested within the shape. The special flight plan had been shared in advance by John Dietrich, Atlas CEO, at the handover ceremony.   Taking off at 7.49 a.m. from Everett, according to the flight tracker FlightAware, the jumbo tacked southeast and then eastwards before starting the maneuver about half an hour in, tracing the crown and the \u201c747\u201d in the air over Washington State, southwest of Spokane. It was performed at an altitude of just under 18,000 feet, at speeds of around 180-390 mph, according to FlightAware. The aerial ballet took around two and a half hours.    Drawing in the sky takes time, it would seem. The aircraft landed at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport at 5.51 p.m. local time, 42 minutes later than planned.  \u2018She\u2019ll always be the queen\u2019 Captain Tom Vize, Atlas Air\u2019s 747 fleet captain, who flew the plane alongside Captain Joe Masone, told CNN that some of the maneuvers were so tricky that the computer had refused to plot them in the system.  \u201cThere were some pretty tight turns, we had some difficulty in the simulator,\u201d he said. \u201cThe computer couldn\u2019t do them that tight, so we had to improvise, and it turned out great.\u201d The sharp angles of the number four were particularly tricky, he said. \u201cIt was a little bit more challenging to make it look sharp and keep those parallel edges on there, especially when the computer was planning it out.  Vize, who called the flight \u201cvery emotional,\u201d said that the idea of drawing the crown \u201ccame at the last minute.\u201d \u201cIt was an iconic [moment] for Atlas, but also for the world, so we wanted to find a way to share it with the world,\u201d he says. The team initially had the idea of writing \u201cforever incredible\u201d in the sky, but \u201cit would have taken more time and area than we had.\u201d Then an employee had a lightbulb moment: they should draw a crown. \u201cThe first [design] had more points on the crown,\u201d he said \u2013 but testing it in a flight simulator made it again too complicated. The flight crew worked with the performance engineering team to create the design, make sure the turns were compliant, and then finalized plans with air traffic control. The span of the design was 80 miles.    Vize says the flight crew were \u201cfocused\u201d rather than nervous. \u201cA lot of people had put work into it and we wanted the world to see it \u2013 we\u2019re avgeeks too and wanted to share it,\u201d he said.  The \u201cgentle giant\u201d took the turns smoothly, he said, and the pilots allowed themselves fistbumps on completing the maneuver. The four-strong crew were given a standing ovation by their six passengers \u2013 Atlas Air executives \u2013 upon landing.  Vize, who has flown the 747 for 23 years, calls the aircraft \u201cdefinitely the greatest airplane.\u201d \u201cEvery time you walk up to it, it gives you goosebumps \u2013 it\u2019s just such a huge airplane, and so reliable in performance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe amount of cargo it takes. The type of cargo. The number of people we can carry, the places it takes us. 170 countries and over 800 destinations \u2013 it\u2019s changed the world but brings it together.  \u201cShe was my career, and she\u2019ll always be the queen.\u201d    \u2018The aircraft that shrank the world\u2019 The crown drawing wasn\u2019t the only nod to the aircraft\u2019s special status. A decal to the right of the nose features the late Joe Sutter, the 747\u2019s chief engineer dubbed \u201cfather of the 747.\u201d   Stan Deal, Boeing\u2019s president and CEO, called the delivery a \u201cmonumental day\u201d and \u201ca testament to the generations of Boeing employees who brought to life the airplane that \u2018shrank the world\u2019.\u201d The aircraft is the last of four new Boeing 747-8 Freighters Atlas ordered in January 2021. The company has 56 747s in its fleet.  Atlas Air will operate the final 747 for Apex Logistics, a Kuehne+Nagel company, under a long-term agreement. The company has operated the 747 into over 800 airports in 170 countries, Dietrich said at the ceremony. ",

            "text": "More than half a century since the original jumbo jet ushered in a glamorous new jet age, helping bring affordable air travel to millions of passengers, the last-ever Boeing 747 was delivered on Tuesday, marking the start of the final chapter for the much-loved airplane. In a ceremony that was broadcast live online, the aircraft was handed over to its new owner, US air cargo operator Atlas Air, at Boeing\u2019s plant in Everett, Washington. In a dramatic opening of the hangar\u2019s sliding doors, Atlas Air\u2019s new plane was revealed behind flags bearing the liveries of every carrier that\u2019s ever taken delivery of a 747. The company has 56 of the aircraft in its fleet. One small significant detail on the last one delivered: a decal right next to the nose paying homage to Joe Sutter, chief engineer of the Boeing 747 program, who died in 2016 and is considered by many as the \u201cfather\u201d of this famous aircraft. Members of the Sutter family, as well as members of the Boeing family representing the company\u2019s founder, Bill Boeing, attended the delivery ceremony on Tuesday. John Dietrich, president and CEO of Atlas Air Worldwide, thanked the assembly of Boeing employees. \u201cThe impact of your work continues well beyond the production lines,\u201d Dietrich said. \u201cIt has fueled childhood dreams and career ambitions while at the same time driving global economies and supply chains.\u201d  Dietrich also shared a flight plan spelling out \u201c747\u201d inside a crown for the \u201cQueen of the Skies\u201d that the new plane is set to fly on Wednesday. A string of speakers representing companies that have relied on the 747 came to celebrate the aircraft. \u201cThe 747 is a symbol for many, many things, and above all, I think it\u2019s a symbol for the world, which the 747 has made substantially smaller,\u201d said Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr. Actor and pilot John Travolta, who narrated a series of videos chronicling the aircraft\u2019s colorful history, appeared to thank the employees of Boeing for \u201cthe most well-thought-out and safest aircraft ever built.\u201d While the final 747 won\u2019t be carrying paying passengers, its delivery is another milestone for the distinctive double-decker \u201cQueen of the Skies,\u201d which revolutionized intercontinental travel while also appearing in James Bond films and even giving piggyback rides to the Space Shuttle.   With the last passenger 747 having entered service more than five years ago, the end of the 747\u2019s enduring career now moves even closer, hastened by airlines switching their preferences to smaller and more economical aircraft. Tuesday\u2019s delivery is a moment long anticipated by the global aviation community. Expectant airplane enthusiasts have followed every step of the final 747\u2019s construction, ever since Boeing announced in July 2020 that it was ceasing production of its one-time flagship. The aircraft, registered as N863GT, made its first public appearance in December, when it was rolled out of the Boeing assembly line covered in anti-corrosive green paint. In early January, photos appeared online of the aircraft, already wearing the Atlas Air livery and the homage to Joe Sutter. Swan song Interestingly for a jet that predates the Apollo Moon landings (it hit the skies a few months earlier, in February 1969), the Boeing 747\u2019s production line has outlasted that of one of its most direct recent competitors, the Airbus A380, which was produced between 2003 and 2021.  It was the introduction of the European double-decker plane in the early 2000s that prompted Boeing to announce, in 2005, one last version of the 747 design that by that time was already starting to show its age.  The B747-8I (or B747-8 Intercontinental), as this last variant of the venerable jumbo jet is called, proved to be a swan song for large four-engined airliners. Even though the A380 is currently enjoying a revival, with airlines rushing to bring stored aircraft back to service in response to the post-Covid air traffic recovery, these giants of the skies struggle to compete with the operational flexibility and fuel economies of smaller twin-engined jets. As of December 2022, there are only 44 passenger versions of the 747 still in service, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. That total is down from more than 130 in service as passenger jets at the end of 2019, just before the pandemic crippled demand for air travel, especially on international routes on which the 747 and other widebody jets were primarily used. Most of those passenger versions of the jets were grounded during the early months of the pandemic and never returned to service. Lufthansa remains the largest operator of the passenger version of the B747-8, with 19 in its current fleet and potential commitments to keep the jumbo flying passengers for years, possibly decades, to come. World\u2019s largest building  The 747 has proven more popular among cargo operators. There are still 314 747 freighters in use, according to Cirium, many of which were initially used as passenger jets before being renovated into freighters. Features such as the distinctive nose-loading capability, and the cockpit\u2019s elevated position, leaving the whole length of the lower fuselage available to carry  large-volume items, have made it a cargo favorite. Tuesday\u2019s delivery also brings questions about what will happen to Boeing\u2019s vast Everett factory, in which the 747 has been produced since 1967. This facility was purpose-built for the Boeing 747 and is, according to the company, the largest building in the world by volume. It\u2019s since served as the main production location for Boeing\u2019s wide-body airliners, the 767, 777 and 787 (the best-selling narrow-body 737, however, is produced at Renton, another location in the Seattle area). Developments in the last few years have been shifting the company\u2019s industrial center of gravity elsewhere. In addition to losing the B747, Everett recently lost the 787 production line, after Boeing decided to consolidate production at its plant in Charleston, South Carolina.  Boeing continues to make the B767 at Everett, a relatively old model with limited commercial perspectives, as well as the B777, which is currently seeing low production rates, in anticipation of its new version, the B777X. The latter, however, has suffered several delays and it is currently going through a certification and development process that is proving to be much lengthier and complex than expected. US presidential planes While Boeing hasn\u2019t disclosed much publicly about what it intends to do with the facilities that housed the Boeing 747 final assembly line, in the run up to the final jumbo delivery reports have emerged that they may be used to work on stored B787 Dreamliners.  What\u2019s more, according to these same sources, Boeing may also produce additional B737s in Everett. Production of this bestselling model currently takes place at another facility in Renton, further south in the greater Seattle area. Despite the fanfare of January 31, there are still two more Boeing 747 deliveries pending \u2013 and they\u2019re by no means ordinary.  These are the two new US presidential planes, which are technically called VC-25, even if they\u2019re popularly referred to as \u201cAir Force One\u201d (a call sign that is only used when the US President is on board).  These two planes have already been built, having originally been destined for Russian airline Transaero, which went bankrupt in 2015. The two future Air Force Ones are currently undergoing an extensive program of modifications to prepare them for presidential service.",

            "text": "Ryanair expects it will be able to charge higher prices for flights over Easter and the summer, thanks to strong demand from American and Asian tourists and less competition from rivals. The low-cost European carrier told customers in an earnings statement on Monday to \u201cbook early\u201d before cheaper tickets sell out. It reported record profit for the three months to December 31, after increasing airfares by 14% compared to their pre-pandemic level. \u201cThe return of Asian traffic to Europe and a particularly strong transatlantic marketplace driven by a very strong dollar will see robust demand both through the Easter and into the summer of 2023 for short-haul flights across Europe,\u201d CEO Michael O\u2019Leary said in a video posted to the company\u2019s website.  The collapse of rival airlines during the pandemic and cuts by competitors to fleets and passenger capacity would also underpin Ryanair\u2019s strong traffic numbers \u201chopefully at higher fares,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. The Dublin-based airline has emerged from the coronavirus pandemic in a strong position, even as several of its competitors went bankrupt or needed government-backed bailouts. The latest casualty was small UK regional carrier Flybe, which filed for bankruptcy and ceased trading over the weekend. Ryanair has also managed to avoid the staff shortages that have plagued rivals, leaving it well positioned to take advantage of a swift recovery in air travel following the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing very strong market share gains in most of our major markets like Italy, Poland, Ireland and Spain where competitors have removed significant capacity or are retreating from competition with us,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. Passenger numbers for the quarter through December climbed to a record 38.4 million. That\u2019s 7% higher than the same quarter in 2019 before the pandemic hit. Fares for the quarter were higher than in 2019 \u201cbecause of a very strong Christmas and New Year period,\u201d according to O\u2019Leary. The airline posted its highest ever third-quarter profit, earning \u20ac211 million ($230 million) for the three months through December compared to a loss of \u20ac96 million ($105 million) for the same period in 2021. That beat its previous record in 2017 of \u20ac106 million ($115.5 million), according to Reuters, and was more than double the result for the comparable quarter in 2019. The Irish airline expects to carry 168 million passengers in the 12 months through March 2023, 13% higher than the year before the coronavirus, which was its previous record. It expects that number to grow to 185 million passengers over the 12 months to March 2024. The airline said its growth forecast was based on the delivery of 124 \u201cGamechanger\u201d Boeing\n            \n                (BA) 737 aircraft for the summer peak, but warned that some of those deliveries could \u201cslip.\u201d  Ryanair has in the past been openly critical of Boeing\u2019s \u201cinability to meet its delivery schedule.\u201d",

The investment banking giant said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday that Solomon received $25 million in annual compensation last year. While that is still a very large amount of money, it\u2019s down nearly 30% from the $35 million that Solomon raked in during 2021.  Solomon\u2019s $2 million annual salary is unchanged. But the company said that his \u201cannual variable compensation,\u201d paid in a mix of performance-based restricted stock units and cash, was well below 2021 levels.  The reason: Weaker earnings compared to 2021\u2019s results. Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) shares also fell more than 10% in 2022, although that wasn\u2019t as big of a drop as the ones suffered by rivals Morgan Stanley\n            \n                (MS), JPMorgan Chase\n            \n                (JPM) and Bank of America\n            \n                (BAC).  Still, Goldman Sachs (like the rest of Wall Street) was hit hard by the slowdown in dealmaking last year. The company reported a 16% drop in revenue in the fourth quarter and profit plunge of 66% earlier this month, mainly due to the lack of merger activity and initial public offerings.  In fact, earnings for Goldman Sachs missed Wall Street\u2019s consensus forecasts by the widest margin since the third quarter of 2011. Solomon said in the company\u2019s earnings release that the company faced \u201ca challenging economic backdrop.\u201d Goldman Sachs is having a particularly tough time trying to branch beyond its traditional businesses of investment banking. The company\u2019s consumer-focused businesses have been losing money and Goldman Sachs is pulling back on some of its efforts to reach average banking customers as a result.

            "title": "Why NASA tested a plane with a pivoting wing",
            "text": "Not many aircraft can claim to be truly one of a kind, but the NASA AD-1 is undoubtedly one of them. A slim pointed cigar with a single wing that pivoted around a central point, which led to a jarring asymmetry in flight. No other piloted plane has ever been built with a wing that could turn to a lopsided 20 to 2 angle \u2013 but the fascinating story is why it did at all.  The concept is known as an \u201coblique wing,\u201d a subset of the \u201cvariable-sweep wing\u201d or \u201cswing wing.\u201d The idea has been around since the 1940s but it wasn\u2019t until the NASA project came along in the 1970s that the technology was put to the test.  It successfully proved that the oblique wing concept had potential for the development of highly efficient supersonic passenger planes, as well as military applications, but more than 40 years after the experimental plane last flew, there have been no others to follow suit.  Its inventor \u2013 aeronautical engineer Robert T. Jones from NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in California \u2013 was a pioneer who wanted to challenge conventions. \u201cOne of the unspoken assumptions in aircraft design is that of bilateral or mirror symmetry,\u201d he wrote in a 1972 scientific study on oblique wings. The idea that a pivoting wing would lead to better supersonic planes was \u201csurprising,\u201d he admitted, but he hoped that he could demonstrate its merits. Before building the AD-1, Jones tested a model in a wind tunnel. The results showed that a supersonic plane with an oblique wing would have twice the fuel economy of a traditional wing. It would also make less noise during takeoff, have a quieter sonic boom, and have an increased range. With this encouraging data, Jones obtained the funding to go full size. 79 flights The AD-1 was a frugally budgeted craft, costing about $240,000 in total, or just under $1 million in today\u2019s money. The figure was so low that some of the agency\u2019s personnel thought they were approving a remotely controlled plane, rather than one with a pilot \u2013 as Bruce I. Larrimer narrates in \u201cThinking Obliquely,\u201d a NASA book about the AD-1 program.  The design was by aviation legend Burt Rutan, known for his bold and often maverick creations. Just over 38 feet long, the single-seat aircraft sat comically low to the ground \u2013 due to a short landing gear optimized for less drag \u2013 and was just 6.75 feet high. It was powered by two small turbojet engines and its top speed was only around 200 miles per hour, in the interest of safety. Most of all it was light, with an empty weight of under 1,500 pounds thanks to a structure made of plastic reinforced with fiberglass. There were no hydraulics at all.  Its main structural curiosity, the pivoting wing, was attached to the fuselage just in front of the engines and powered by electric motors activated by a switch in the cockpit. During takeoff and landing, the wing was always in the neutral, or perpendicular, position. It was only activated during cruise, and in slow increments over the course of the program\u2019s 79 flights.    Proof of concept The plane first took to the air on December 21, 1979, with NASA research pilot Thomas McMurtry at the controls: \u201cHe was anxious about how it would behave,\u201d says Christian Gelzer, chief historian at NASA\u2019s Armstrong Flight Research Center. \u201cThe wing could pivot back [to the traditional] 90 degrees to the fuselage to be able to land, and he found out that you\u2019d have to do a very gentle, slow descent, but you\u2019d get what you needed and it would be okay.\u201d  The wing\u2019s maximum sweep of 60 degrees was reached in April 1981, after which the aircraft was flown for another year of further testing. All pilots involved with the program were asked to rate its handling, and the general consensus was that the AD-1\u2019s performance was acceptable up to 50 degrees of sweep, or just shy of the maximum. Some degradation occurred beyond that \u2013 described by NASA as \u201cunpleasant flying characteristics and poor handling qualities\u201d \u2013 but which the agency believed could have been improved with more sophisticated materials and construction. What mattered most, however, was proving the concept that the plane could fly safely and with reduced drag, confirming Jones\u2019 wind tunnel results: \u201cThe principle worked,\u201d says Gelzer, \u201cand I think the AD-1 was like other experimental NASA planes, in that how it behaved was less concerning compared to whether or not it did what it was meant to do.\u201d  Oblique future  During the program, Boeing and Lockheed conducted design studies on potential supersonic passenger planes with an oblique wing design, to be ready to build one by the time the AD-1 had proved the concept.  One proposed plane, the Boeing 5-7, could carry 190 passengers and cruise at Mach 1.2, faster than sound, using four turbofan engines. It would have been 287 feet long, with a wingspan of 202 feet in the unswept position, reducing to just 130 feet at maximum sweep. But the Boeing 5-7 never progressed beyond an idea on paper, nor did any other oblique-wing plane except the AD-1 itself, which made its final flight way back in 1982. The reason is that a pivoting wing was just too mechanically complicated compared to simply shaping the wings for supersonic speeds and accepting the compromise of lower efficiency when flying subsonic. This design could take the form of a delta wing \u2013 a triangular shape used by Concorde, among others \u2013 or simply a swept wing, at an angle optimized for faster-than-sound travel.  Some military planes, such as the 1980s B-1B Lancer or the 1960s F-111 Aardvark, had wings with variable geometry, which would stay fully open at subsonic speeds, and then pivot closer to the fuselage when flying supersonic, offering the best possible handling and fuel efficiency. But their complicated engineering and moving parts added complexity, weight and the possibility of mechanical failures: \u201cIn the case of the F-111, there were two gigantic titanium gears moving the wings. Titanium is expensive, hard to work with and heavy,\u201d says Gelzer.  The AD-1, with just one pivoting wing rather than two, was in part meant to achieve the same benefits with less complication, but ultimately still wouldn\u2019t best a simple swept wing design: \u201cNobody builds [variable geometry] airplanes anymore, even if they\u2019re trying to go supersonic \u2013 they just sweep the wings and they fly it that way. It may not be as efficient as you want it, but it saves the headache of the mechanism and it saves the headache of the weight,\u201d Gelzer adds. In the end, the AD-1 program showed potential, but not enough to warrant investing in a complicated system that modern design had rendered superfluous. However, the data gathered during those 79 flights has been useful \u2013 and we can\u2019t rule out that it could become useful again sometime in the future. \u201cI would never say that the concept is never going to come back,\u201d says Gelzer. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see the application right now, because we\u2019ve got a way around what we were trying to fix.\u201d Top image: The NASA AD-1 oblique wing research aircraft performs a wing sweep test flight.

Across the board there are strains in the system, aircraft manufacturers delivering, having enough pilots and all of those stresses and strains means that the system is tighter.\u201d \u201cAnd when something happens, the straws are much more likely to break the camel\u2019s back. And you\u2019ve seen it over and over again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t take much to break the back of the system.\u201d The challenges facing the industry were underscored again Wednesday when bad weather forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights, with Southwest Airlines hit particularly hard. A winter storm battered cities such as Chicago, Indianapolis and Cleveland, where Southwest has a strong presence. Kirby said the only solution is for airlines to run with more back-up planes and more back-up staff in place than they had ever done in days before the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re running with about 10% more pilots per block hour [of operation] than we did pre-pandemic. You know, we have 25% more spare airplanes, and really across the board, we\u2019re just having more buffer and more resources that gives us the ability to firewall when something happens,\u201d he said. That can be more expensive for airlines. But the strong rebound in travel demand, combined with the still-tight availability of seating, means that fares are higher than they were even before the pandemic.  Kirby insisted there are still bargains to be found. \u201cYou could still often pay less for your airfare than the Uber to get you to the airport costs,\u201d he said. But United\u2019s own financial results released last week show the amount being paid by United passengers for every mile flown was up 21% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period of 2019, right before the pandemic. United and all the airlines are scrambling to increase capacity \u2014 and staffing.  United placed two major aircraft orders in the last two years. One \u2014 in June 2021 \u2014 was the largest in the airline\u2019s history. That order was for 200 Boeing 737 Max jets along with 70 Airbus A321neo planes. The other in December was for at least 100 more 737 Max jets and 100 787 Dreamliners. And to remedy its pilot crunch, United has become the first US airline to open its own pilot training school, the Aviate academy. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity to train the next generation,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cThere\u2019s just been big barriers to entry. [We\u2019re] able to give them access even if they don\u2019t have the financial means on their own.\u201d Seventy percent of Aviate\u2019s first graduating class were women or people of color. \u201cToday, at United 19% of our pilots are women or people of color. And I think we\u2019re the highest of any airline in the country,\u201d Kirby said. ",

Takeshi Uchiyamada, Toyota\u2019s current chairman, will resign from his post but remain on the board, the company said. The changes are set to take effect on April 1.  The leadership reshuffle marks the end of an era.

But Toyoda alluded to a tough tenure during a press conference in Japan on Thursday, saying: \u201cWhen I look back on my last 13 years as president, there was never a day that was peaceful.\u201d \u201cNever did I experience a calm and peaceful year,\u201d he said, saying that he did not always feel \u201cwelcomed as president,\u201d and that it was tough to hear criticism of his leadership. \u201cI believe that over the past 13 years, I have built a solid foundation for passing the baton forward.\u201d The 66-year old CEO has previously said that he preferred working \u201cwith the factory guys\u201d on the assembly line to \u201csitting in an office.\u201d The regime change comes as Toyota is being scrutinized for lagging in the electric vehicle race. Unlike other automakers that are going all-in on EVs, Toyota has previously said it\u2019s still not convinced that\u2019s the best path forward. The world\u2019s largest automaker in terms of vehicles sold, Toyota has hung back behind most other major global competitors in building fully battery powered EVs, despite its history of being a leader in hybrid vehicles. However, the carmaker has been investing more than others in developing electric vehicles powered by on-board hydrogen fuel cells, rather than rechargeable batteries.  Sato, who currently serves as Toyota\u2019s operating officer and chief branding officer in addition to overseeing Lexus, said Thursday that his new leadership team would be focused on turning the automaker into a full-fledged \u201cmobility company.\u201d \u2014 Chris Isidore contributed to this report.",

Unlike Elon Musk\u2019s even more prolific rocket company, SpaceX, which builds larger rockets capable of hauling tens of thousands of pounds to orbit, Rocket Lab builds lightweight launch vehicles designed solely to lift small satellites \u2014 as compact as a loaf of bread or a refrigerator \u2014 to space.  Though the company has been headquartered in the United States since its inception, all of its prior launches have taken place at a pad near Ahuriri Point, located on the east coast of New Zealand\u2019s North Island. But Rocket Lab has sought for years to bring some of its launch operations stateside, in part so that it can provide services to the US government and military, which make up a lucrative slice of the global launch business customer base. The NASA Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island in Virginia\u2019s Accomack County is one of the oldest launch sites in the world. The first rocket flight took off from the site in 1945, before the creation of the space agency. More recently, the facility has been home to Northrop Grumman\u2019s Antares rocket, which launches cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station. Before selecting Wallops as its second launch location, officials at Rocket Lab did evaluate whether to move into one of the United States\u2019 other prime launch locations, including Florida\u2019s Space Coast, the busiest launch port in the nation. Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck told the press in 2018, when Rocket Lab chose Virginia as its launch destination, that the state was the obvious choice because it allowed the company to rapidly build up its infrastructure. The company also chose to set up production of a larger rocket it has in its development pipeline, called the Neutron. Rocket Lab is setting up a manufacturing complex in close proximity to the launch pad at Wallops. \u201cNeutron is a new generation of rocket that will advance the way space is accessed, and Virginia makes perfect sense as a significant site for Neutron\u2019s early development,\u201d Beck said in a February 2022 statement. \u201cIts position on the eastern seaboard is the ideal location to support both Neutron\u2019s expected frequent launch cadence and the rocket\u2019s return-to-Earth capability of landing back at its launch site after lift-off.\u201d Rocket Lab has made headlines for its attempts to reuse its first-stage rocket boosters, the largest part of the spacecraft that gives the initial burst of thrust at liftoff. Rather than attempting to steer the rocket to a pinpoint landing on the ground, as SpaceX does with its Falcon vehicles, Rocket Lab is aiming to figure out how to snag its boosters mid-air using a hook-wielding helicopter.",

            "title": "Here\u2019s what Boeing blames for its big loss",
            "text": "Boeing reported a $650 million operating loss in the fourth quarter, surprising Wall Street analysts who had expected the aircraft giant to turn a profit. The company blamed the unexpected loss on \u201cabnormal production costs\u201d as it tried both to deliver the remaining backlog of 737 Max jets and to step up deliveries of the 787 Dreamliners. The company\u2019s production of the 787 remains below normal rates. \u201cWe continue to face a few too many stoppages in our lines \u2026 as we run into supply chain shortfalls,\u201d CEO Dave Calhoun told investors Wednesday. \u201cSo those stoppages, while they are coming down, are not where they need to be.\u201d What\u2019s more, Boeing had to shell out an unspecified amount of compensation to 787 customers whose deliveries were delayed by about a year. The company also warned Wednesday that it will post a loss in the current quarter, although it did not give a range. That\u2019s a disappointment, as analysts have been forecasting the Boeing would report a narrow profit for the quarter. Shares of Boeing\n            \n                (BA) were down more than 3% in late morning trading after that guidance. Boeing has reported only two profitable quarters in the nearly four years since the grounding of the 737 Max. After two fatal crashes that killed 346 people, the jet was grounded for 20 months starting in March 2019. Then a year later, the pandemic brought demand for flying and new aircraft to a near halt \u2014 sparking the cancellation of hundreds of jet orders and the pileup of losses for Boeing. Still, the industry has shown signs of picking up, and analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had forecast that Boeing would earn 26 cents a share. Instead it reported a loss of $1.75 a share. So while that\u2019s an improvement from the loss of $7.69 a share in the fourth quarter of of 2021, it\u2019s also another big disappointment. A difficult few years Boeing\u2019s problems in the fourth quarter are tied to its difficult few years since the 737 Max crisis.   For one, the company was saddled with excess inventory of hundreds of the jets. Usually Boeing doesn\u2019t hold onto inventory, as planes are delivered to customers soon after completion. But even though the 737 Max jets couldn\u2019t be delivered during the grounding, Boeing kept building them \u2014 partly to keep its suppliers in business. Then it was forced to find new buyers for some of those planes due to customers canceling orders during the pandemic. Beyond the Max, the FAA flagged quality problems with the company\u2019s 787 Dreamliners that stopped it from delivering that model. Though the Dreamliner was not grounded like the Max, it still affected the company: Much of Boeing\u2019s abnormal production costs last quarter were a result of having to rework both the Max and Dreamliner jets, CEO Dave Calhoun said in an interview on CNBC Wednesday. The supply chain problems are improving, Calhoun added, but they are not behind the company or the aerospace industry as a whole, He suggested more money-losing quarters may be ahead despite a rebound in demand, saying he expects Boeing to have \u201cbouncy\u201d margins throughout the year as its Max and Dreamliner inventories are cleared. Boeing delivered 152 commercial jets in the quarter, up 54% from a year ago and better than its own target. But digging deeper into the financial results highlights a potential problem: It appears Boeing received lower prices on some of its planes than analysts had expected.  That\u2019s because the company\u2019s revenue fell short of forecasts, coming in at just below $20 billion. While it was Boeing\u2019s highest revenue figure since the start of the pandemic, it was about $360 million less than analysts\u2019 consensus estimate. The combination of better-than-expected deliveries but worse-than-forecast revenue suggests that weaker pricing. \u2018Focused on driving stability\u2019 Boeing tried to put the best spin possible on its disappointing results. The company pointed out that this was the first full year of positive operating cash flow since the start of the 737 Max crisis. Boeing finally brought in $3.5 billion more cash than it spent, and the company reaffirmed its guidance for 2023 of positive operating cash flow of between $4.5 bililon to $6.5 billion. \u201cDemand across our portfolio is strong, and we remain focused on driving stability in our operations and within the supply chain to meet our commitments in 2023 and beyond,\u201d said Calhoun in the company\u2019s statement. \u201cWhile challenges remain, we are well positioned and are on the right path to restoring our operational and financial strength.\u201d",

            "text": "The phrase \u201cqueen of the skies\u201d has just taken on another meaning. While the now-discontinued Boeing 747 bore the moniker in the past, Virgin Atlantic is repurposing the phrase as it names a plane after the late Queen Elizabeth II. The airline has occasionally named its planes after notable women in history, including British suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst, singer Billie Holiday and Diana, Princess of Wales. Now, the airline\u2019s brand new Airbus A330neo, with the registration G-VEII, has been dubbed Queen of the Skies in honor of the late monarch. The livery is painted with an image of a redheaded woman wearing a dress in Virgin\u2019s trademark red shade.    \u201cJust like Queen Elizabeth during her historic 70-year reign, Virgin Atlantic is proud to fly the flag for the United Kingdom around the world,\u201d said Corneel Koster, chief customer and operations officer at Virgin Atlantic, in a statement.  \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to soon be welcoming \u2018Queen of the Skies\u2019 to our fleet and hope that it serves as a fitting tribute to an unforgettable, much-loved monarch.\u201d Queen Elizabeth, who died in September 2022, was a frequent traveler during her reign, visiting more than 120 countries. The Royal Air Force plane that carried her coffin from Edinburgh to London ahead of her funeral set a record on the flight-tracking website FlighRadar24. The 72-minute flight was followed by 4.79 million people on Flightradar24\u2019s website and mobile app, plus an additional 296,000 who tracked the plane on YouTube. The A330neo was delivered to much fanfare in 2019. The wide-body aircraft has long, slender wings which reduces drag in the air and burns less fuel.  Top: The Queen of the Skies plane.

            "text": "Late last August, a solar-powered drone called Zephyr almost beat one of aviation\u2019s most enduring records.  The unmanned aircraft, operated by the US Army and produced by Airbus, flew for 64 days, 18 hours and 26 minutes before unexpectedly crashing down in Arizona \u2013 just four hours shy of breaking the record for the longest ever continuous flight. That record was set 64 years ago, in 1959, by Robert Timm and John Cook, who flew aboard a four-seater aircraft in the skies over Las Vegas for 64 days, 22 hours and 19 minutes. It\u2019s remarkable that the Zephyr \u2013 a light aircraft with modern technology which was flying autonomously \u2013 not only failed to beat that time, but even if it had, Timm and Cook would still have retained the world endurance record for a crewed flight.  In fact, it\u2019s nothing short of astonishing that Timm and Cook managed to stay in the air for so long, in an era that was closer to the Wright brothers\u2019 first flight than today. The fuel problem In 1956, the Hacienda hotel and casino opened at the southern end of the Las Vegas Strip.  It was one of the first family-oriented resorts in Las Vegas, and looking for publicity, the hotel owner took upon the suggestion of one of its employees: fly a plane bearing the hotel\u2019s name on its side, and use it to beat the flight endurance record, which stood at almost 47 days in the air and had been set in 1949.  The employee, a former World War II fighter pilot turned slot machine repairman named Robert Timm, received $100,000 to set up the event, which was then tied to a fundraiser for cancer research.  Timm spent months modifying his chosen aircraft, a Cessna 172: \u201cIt was a relatively new design,\u201d says Janet Bednarek, an aviation historian and professor at the University of Dayton. \u201cIt\u2019s a roomy four-seater airplane and it was known for being reliable and fairly easy to fly \u2013 something you don\u2019t have to pay attention to every moment. And when you\u2019re doing long duration, you want an airplane that\u2019s just going to kind of hum along there.\u201d The modifications included a mattress to sleep on, a small steel sink for personal hygiene, the removal of most of the interior fittings to save weight, and a rudimentary autopilot.  \u201cThe important thing, however, was to create a way to refuel,\u201d says Bednarek. \u201cThere had been a lot of experiments up to this point with aerial refueling, but there really was no way to modify a Cessna 172 to be refueled in midair. So they set up an extra tank that could be filled from a truck on the ground. When they needed to refuel, they would come down and fly very low and just above stall speed, then the truck came along and winched up a hose and then used a pump to transfer the fuel into the airplane. It really was a dramatic show of airmanship, because they had to do it at night sometimes and that required some precision flying.\u201d  Fourth time\u2019s a charm Timm\u2019s first three attempts at the record ended abruptly due to mechanical failures, with the longest leaving him and his co-pilot in the air for about 17 days. In September 1958, however, the record itself was bested by another team, also flying a Cessna 172; it now stood at over 50 days. For his fourth attempt, Timm selected John Cook, who was also an airplane mechanic, as his new co-pilot, having struggled to get along with his previous one.  They set off on December 4, 1958, from McCarran Airport in Las Vegas. As with the previous tries, the first step was to fly low over a speeding car, to get one of the landing wheels painted and rule out cheating: \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t have been any way to track their altitude and airspeed at all times,\u201d says Bednarek, \u201cSo they painted a white stripe on at least one of the tires. That would then be scuffed if they\u2019d ever landed, and before their actual landing they would check to see that none of the paint had been scuffed off.\u201d The flight went smoothly at the beginning, and the pair spent Christmas Day in the air. Each time they refueled \u2013 over a stretch of very straight road along the California-Arizona border \u2013 they would also get supplies and food, in the form of dishes from the Hacienda\u2019s restaurants that had been mashed up to fit into Thermos flasks, making it more practical to send them up to the plane.  Bathroom breaks happened on a foldable camp toilet and the resulting plastic bags were later thrown out over the desert. An extendable platform on the co-pilot side provided more space for shaving and bathing (a quart of bath water would be sent up every other day.)  The two would take turns sleeping, although the incessant engine noise and the aerodynamic vibrations made a restful night impossible. As a result of sleep deprivation, on day 36, Timm dozed off at the controls and the plane flew by itself for over an hour, at an altitude of just 4,000 feet. The autopilot had saved their lives \u2013 although it would stop working completely just a few days later.  The end, at last On day 39, the electrical pump that sent the fuel into the plane\u2019s tanks failed, forcing them to start completing the operation manually. When they finally beat the record, on January 23, 1959, the list of technical failures included, among other things, the cabin heater, the fuel gauge and the landing lights: \u201cThe important thing was that the engine kept going, which is really kind of remarkable. It\u2019s a long time to be flying. Even if you keep it fueled and oiled, eventually just the heat and the friction are going to cause problems,\u201d says Bednarek. Nevertheless, the two remained in the air and kept going for as long as possible, to make sure their new record would be impossible to beat. They endured for another 15 days, before finally landing at McCarran on February 7, 1959, having flown nonstop for over two months and 150,000 miles. \u201cThey had determined that they had passed the point where nobody else was going to try this \u2013 and nobody has,\u201d Bednarek adds.  \u201cI think they\u2019d reached the end of the rope and decided it wouldn\u2019t have done them any good to crash, and so they came down. They were in pretty bad shape: We know that such a period of inactivity can be very bad for the body, and even though they did move around in the aircraft, they couldn\u2019t stand up or stretch and they certainly couldn\u2019t exercise or walk around.  \u201cIt would be like sitting for 64 days \u2013 that is not good for the human body. They had to be carried out of the aircraft.\u201d Will this record ever be beaten by a human crew? Bednarek believes it could happen only if the attempt involved an aircraft testing some new form of propulsion or energy source, to show its utility.  Anyone aspiring to try, however, should heed the warning of co-pilot John Cook, who said this when a reporter asked if he would ever do it again: \u201cNext time I feel in the mood to fly endurance, I\u2019m going to lock myself in a garbage can with the vacuum cleaner running, and have Bob [Timm] serve me T-bone steaks chopped up in a Thermos bottle. That is, until my psychiatrist opens for business in the morning.\u201d ",

            "text": "In the fervor-filled days leading up to the November 16 launch of the long-awaited Artemis I mission, an uncrewed trip around the moon, some industry insiders admitted to having conflicting emotions about the event. On one hand, there was the thrill of watching NASA take its first steps toward eventually getting humans back to the lunar surface; on the other, a shadow cast by the long and costly process it took to get there. \u201cI have mixed feelings, though I hope that we have a successful mission,\u201d former NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao said in an opinion roundtable interview with The New York Times. \u201cIt is always exciting to see a new vehicle fly. For perspective, we went from creating NASA to landing humans on the moon in just under 11 years. This program has, in one version or another, been ongoing since 2004.\u201d  There have been numerous delays with the development of the rocket at the center of the Artemis I mission: NASA\u2019s Space Launch System (SLS), the most powerful rocket ever flown \u2014 and one of the most controversial. The towering launch vehicle was originally expected to take flight in 2016.  And the decade-plus that the rocket was in development sparked years of blistering criticism targeted toward the space agency and Boeing, which holds the primary contract for the SLS rocket\u2019s core.   NASA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) repeatedly called out what it referred to as Boeing\u2019s \u201cpoor performance,\u201d as a contributing factor in the billions of dollars in cost overruns and schedule delays that plagued SLS.   \u201cCost increases and schedule delays of Core Stage development can be traced largely to management, technical, and infrastructure issues driven by Boeing\u2019s poor performance,\u201d one 2018 report from NASA\u2019s OIG, the first in a series of audits the OIG completed surrounding NASA\u2019s management of the SLS program, read. And a report in 2020 laid out similar grievances. For its part, Boeing has pushed back on the criticism, pointing to rigorous testing requirements and the overall success of the program. The OIG report also included correspondence from NASA, which noted in 2018 that it \u201chad already recognized the opportunity to improve contract performance management\u201d and agreed with the report\u2019s recommendations. In various op-eds, the rocket has also been deemed \u201cthe result of unfortunate compromises and unholy politics,\u201d a \u201ccolossal waste of money\u201d and an \u201cirredeemable mistake.\u201d  Despite all the heated debate that has followed SLS, by all accounts, the rocket is here to stay. And officials at NASA and Boeing said its first launch two months ago was practically flawless.  \u201cI worked over 50 Space Shuttle launches,\u201d Boeing SLS program manager John Shannon told CNN by phone. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t ever remember a launch that was as clean as that one was, which for a first-time rocket \u2014 especially one that had been through as much as this one through all the testing \u2014 really put an exclamation point on how reliable and robust this vehicle really is.\u201d  The Artemis program manager at NASA, Mike Sarafin, also said during a post-launch news conference that the rocket \u201cperformed spot-on.\u201d But with its complicated history and its hefty price tag, SLS could still face detractors in the years to come. Why SLS is so controversial  Many have questioned why SLS needs to exist at all. With the estimated cost per launch standing at more than $4 billion for the first four Artemis missions, it\u2019s possible commercial rockets, like the massive Mars rocket SpaceX is building, could get the job done more efficiently, as the chief of space policy at the nonprofit exploration advocacy group Planetary Society, Casey Dreier, recently observed in an article laying out both sides of the SLS argument.  (NASA Administrator Bill Nelson noted that the $4 billion per-launch cost estimate includes development costs that the space agency hopes will be amortized over the course of 10 or more missions.)  Boeing was selected in 2012 to build SLS\u2019s \u201ccore stage,\u201d which is the hulking orange fuselage that houses most of the massive engines that give the rocket its first burst of power at liftoff.  Though more than 1,000 companies were involved with designing and building SLS, Boeing\u2019s work involved the largest and most expensive portion of the rocket.   That process began over a decade ago, and when the Artemis program was established in 2019, it gave the rocket its purpose: return humans to the moon, establish a permanent lunar outpost, and, eventually, pave the path toward getting humans to Mars.  But the SLS is no longer the only rocket involved in the program. NASA gave SpaceX a significant role in 2021, giving the company a fixed-price contract for use of its Mars rocket as the vehicle that will ferry astronauts to the lunar surface after they leave Earth and travel to the moon\u2019s orbit on SLS. SpaceX\u2019s forthcoming rocket, called Starship, is also intended to be capable of completing a crewed mission to the moon or Mars on its own. (Starship, it should be noted, is still in the development phases and has not yet been tested in orbit.) Boeing has repeatedly argued that SLS is essential and capable of performing tasks that other rockets cannot.  \u201cThe bottom line is there\u2019s nothing else like the SLS because it was built from the ground up to be human rated,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cIt is the only vehicle that can take the Orion spacecraft and the service module to the moon. And that\u2019s the purpose-built design \u2014 to take large hardware and humans to cislunar space, and nothing else exists that can do that.\u201d  Starship, meanwhile, is not tailored solely to NASA\u2019s specific lunar goals. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has talked for more than a decade about his desire to get humans to Mars. More recently, he has said Starship could also be used to house giant space telescopes. Yet, another reason critics remain skeptical of SLS is because of its origins. The rocket\u2019s conception can be traced back to NASA\u2019s Constellation program, which was a plan to return to the moon mapped out under former President George W. Bush that was later canceled.   But the SLS has survived. Many observers have suggested a big reason was the desire to maintain space industry jobs in certain Congressional districts and to beef up aerospace supply chains.    Much of the criticism levied against SLS, however, has focused on the actual process of getting the rocket built.   The cost-plus controversy At one point in 2019, former NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine considered sidelining the SLS rocket entirely, citing frustrations with the delays.  \u201cAt the end of the day, the contractors had an obligation to deliver what NASA had contracted for them to deliver,\u201d Bridenstine told CNN by phone last month. \u201cAnd I was frustrated like most of America.\u201d Still, Bridenstine said, when his office reviewed the matter, it found \u201cthere were no options that were going to cost less money or take less time than just finishing the SLS\u201d \u2014 and the rocket was never ultimately sidelined. (Bridenstine noted he was also publicly critical of delayed projects led by SpaceX and others.) NASA continued to stand by Boeing and the SLS rocket even as it became a political hot potato, with some in Congress both criticizing its costs and refusing to abandon the program.  The SLS rocket ended up flying its first launch more than six years later than originally intended. NASA had allocated $6.2 billion to the SLS program as of 2018, but that price tag more than tripled to $23 billion as of 2022, according to an analysis by the Planetary Society.  Those escalating costs can be traced back to the type of contracts that NASA signed with Boeing and its other major suppliers for SLS. It\u2019s called cost-plus, which puts the financial burden on NASA when projects face cost overruns while still offering contractors extra payments, or award fees. In testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Science last year, current NASA Administrator Bill Nelson criticized the cost-plus contracting method, calling it a \u201cplague.\u201d  More in vogue are \u201cfixed-price\u201d contracts, which have a firm price cap, like the kind NASA gave to Boeing and SpaceX for its Commercial Crew Program.  In an interview with CNN in December, however, Nelson stood by cost-plus contracting for SLS and Orion, the vehicle that is designed to carry astronauts and rides atop the rocket to space. He said that without that type of contract, in his view, NASA\u2019s private-sector contractors simply wouldn\u2019t be willing to take on a rocket designed for such a specific purpose and exploring deep space. Building a rocket as specific and technically complex as SLS isn\u2019t a risk many private-sector companies are anxious to take on, he noted. \u201cYou really have difficulty in the development of a new and very exquisite spacecraft \u2026 on a fixed-price contract,\u201d he said.  \u201cThat industry is just not willing to accept that kind of thing, with the exception of the landers,\u201d he added, referring to two other branches of the Artemis program: robotic landers that will deliver cargo to the moon\u2019s surface and SpaceX\u2019s $2.9 billion lunar lander contract. Both of those will use fixed-price \u2014 often referred to as \u201ccommercial\u201d \u2014 contracts.  \u201cAnd even there, they\u2019re getting a considerable investment by the federal government,\u201d Nelson said.   Boeing\u2019s \u2018poor performance\u2019 Still, government watchdogs have not pulled punches when assessing these cost-plus contracts and Boeing\u2019s role. \u201cWe did notice very poor contractor performance on Boeing\u2019s part. There\u2019s poor planning and poor execution,\u201d NASA Inspector General Paul Martin said during testimony before the House\u2019s Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics last year. \u201cWe saw that the cost-plus contracts that NASA had been using\u2026worked to the contractor\u2019s \u2014 rather than NASA\u2019s \u2014 advantage.\u201d Shannon, the Boeing executive, acknowledged in an interview that Boeing and SLS have faced loud detractors, but he said that the value of the drawn out development and testing program would become evident as SLS flies. \u201cI am extremely proud that NASA \u2014 even though there were significant schedule pressures \u2014 they could set up a test program that was incredibly comprehensive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Boeing team worked through that test process and hit every mark on it. And you see the results. You see a vehicle that is not just visually spectacular, but its performance was spectacular. And it really put us on the road to be able to do lunar exploration again, which is something that\u2019s very important in this country.\u201d But the rocket is still facing criticism. During a Congressional hearing with the House\u2019s Science, Space, and Technology Committee in March 2022, NASA\u2019s Inspector General said that current cost estimates for SLS were \u201cunsustainable,\u201d gauging that the space agency will have spent $93 billion on the Artemis program from 2012 through September 2025.   Martin, the NASA inspector general, specifically pointed to Boeing as one of the contractors that would need to find \u201cefficiencies\u201d to bring down those costs as the Artemis program moves forward. In a December 7 statement to CNN, Boeing once again defended SLS and its price point.  \u201cBoeing is and has been committed to improving our processes \u2014 both while the program was in its developmental stage and now as it transitions to an operational phase,\u201d the statement read, noting the company already implemented \u201clessons learned\u201d from building the first rocket to \u201cdrive efficiencies from a cost and schedule perspective\u201d for future SLS rockets.  \u201cWhen adjusted for inflation, NASA has developed SLS for a quarter of the cost of the Saturn V and half the cost of the Space Shuttle,\u201d the statement noted. \u201cThese programs have also been essential to investing in the NASA centers, workforce and test facilities that are used by a broad range of civil and commercial partners across NASA and industry.\u201d  Boeing and the path forward  The successful launch of SLS was a welcome winning moment for Boeing. Over the past few years, the company has been mired in controversy, including ongoing delays and myriad issues with Starliner, a spacecraft built for NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, and scandal after scandal plaguing its airplane division.   Now that the Artemis I mission has returned safely home, NASA and Boeing can turn to preparing more of the gargantuan SLS rockets to launch even loftier missions.  SLS is slated to launch the Artemis II mission, which will take four astronauts on a journey around the moon, in 2024. From there, SLS will be the backbone of the Artemis III mission that will return humans to the lunar surface for the first time in five decades and a series of increasingly complex missions as NASA works to create its permanent lunar outpost. Shannon, the Boeing SLS program manager, told CNN that construction of the next two SLS rocket cores is well underway, with the booster for Artemis II on track to be finished in April \u2014 more than a year before the mission is scheduled to take off. All of the \u201cmajor components\u201d for a third SLS rocket are also completed, Shannon added. For the third SLS core and beyond, Boeing is also moving final assembly to new facilities Florida, freeing up space at its manufacturing facilities to increase production, which may help drive down costs. Shannon declined to share a specific price point for the new rockets or share any internal pricing goals, though NASA is expected to sign new contracts for the rockets that will launch the Artemis V mission and beyond, which could significantly change the price per launch. Nelson also told CNN in December that NASA \u201cwill be making improvements, and we will find cost savings where we can,\u201d such as with the decision to use commercial contracts for other vehicles under the Artemis program umbrella. How and whether those contracts bear out remain to be seen: SpaceX needs to get its Starship rocket flying, a massive space station called Gateway needs to come to fruition, and at least some of the robotic lunar landers designed to carry cargo to the moon will need to prove their effectiveness. It\u2019s also not yet clear whether those contracts will result in enough cost savings for the critics of SLS, including NASA\u2019s OIG, to consider the Artemis program sustainable. As for SLS, Nelson also told reporters December 11, just after the conclusion of the Artemis I mission, that he had every reason to expect that lawmakers would continue to fund the rocket and NASA\u2019s broader moon program. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about the support from the Congress,\u201d Nelson said.  And Bridenstine, Nelson\u2019s predecessor who has been publicly critical SLS, said that he ultimately stands by SLS and points out that, controversies aside, it does have rare bipartisan support from its bankrollers.  \u201cWe are in a spot now where this is going to be successful,\u201d Bridenstine said last month, recalling when he first realized the Artemis program had support from the right and left. \u201cAll of America is going to be proud of this program. And yes, there are going to be differences. People are gonna say well, you should go all commercial and drop SLS\u2026but at the end of the day, what we have to do is we have to bring together all of the things that are the best programs that we can get for America and use them to go to the moon.\u201d",

            "text": "As the climate crisis intensifies, the pressure on the aviation industry to cut emissions increases. And now, the industry has taken a step forward, with a successful test flight of a hydrogen-electric engine, which produces no carbon emissions. ZeroAvia\u2019s 19-seater Dornier 228 twin-engine aircraft completed a roughly 10-minute test flight on Thursday in the UK. While 19 seats is, of course, tiny compared to regular passenger aircraft, it is the largest aircraft to have made a successful flight powered by hydrogen-electric.  Using liquid hydrogen to feed fuel cells, the technology eliminates carbon emissions during the flight. This is part of a race to decarbonize the aviation industry, which currently accounts for around 2.5% of global carbon emissions, although its overall contribution to climate is estimated to be higher, due to the other gases, water vapor and contrails it emits. Hydrogen has been identified as a promising fuel solution for planes because it produces no greenhouse gases when burned. However, unless the hydrogen is produced using renewable energy, the process for creating it relies on fossil fuels. The Dornier 228 was retrofitted with a full size prototype hydrogen-electric powertrain, containing two fuel cell stacks, on the aircraft\u2019s left wing. Lithium-ion battery packs amped up support during takeoff, while hydrogen tanks and fuel cell power generation systems were placed inside the cabin, with the seats removed. Half the power came from the fuel cells, and half from the battery packs, a company representative confirmed in a post-flight press conference. The right wing carried a regular engine, for safety reasons \u2013 although it was not used during the flight. Starting from Cotswold Airport, the airplane completed taxi, takeoff, a full pattern circuit and landing all on the hydrogen-electric engine. It reached a speed of 120 knots, or 139 miles per hour. \u201cAll systems performed as expected,\u201d the company said in a press release.  For a commercial flight, of course, the hydrogen tanks and fuel cell power generation systems would be housed on the outside of the aircraft. The company now aims to finalize configuration and submit it for certification by the end of the year.  In a press conference, a company representative said that there were no plans \u201cat the moment\u201d to install the hydrogen-electric powertrains (the mechanism which drives the plane, including fuel tanks and engine) on both wings, but added \u201cEverything is possible, and we are learning.\u201d The company has yet to confirm its launch aircraft. ZeroAvia\u2019s flight is part of the UK Government-backed HyFlyer II project, which aims to develop a 600kW powertrain to allow zero-emissions flight for 9-19 seater aircraft, and is targeting a 300 nautical mile range. The flight was conducted under a full Part 21 flight permit with the UK Civil Aviation Authority.  The company has come a long way since September 2020, when it completed a hydrogen-electric powered flight of a six-seater Piper Malibu, using a 250kW hydrogen-electric powertrain. It has since completed over 30 flights with the smaller engine. The company \u2013 which already has partnerships with seven aircraft manufacturers \u2013 has 1,500 pre-orders for differing engine variants, according to founder and CEO Val Miftakhov at the press conference. Up to 700 of them are for the size of engine that was trialed in the UK on Thursday. \u201cWe know the market is there for it, it\u2019s now all about pushing this to the final design,\u201d he added.  The company aims to be serving commercial flights with the technology by 2025. It also aims to scale up the technology to larger 90-seater aircraft, with \u201cfurther expansion\u201d into narrowbodies in the next decade, they said in a statement. By 2027, they aim to be able to power a 700-mile flight in a 40-80 seater aircraft.  The latter is no simple task.  While hydrogen-powered aircraft have been in development since the mid-20th Century, they have faced significant obstacles, mainly hydrogen\u2019s low energy density by volume compared to kerosene \u2013 meaning it would take up about four times the space of jet fuel \u2013 and the latter\u2019s availability and historically low price. The infrastructure required to produce and distribute hydrogen is also an issue. At this year\u2019s Airbus Summit, an industry event hosted by the aircraft manufacturer, Airbus boss Guillaume Faury warned that this was \u201ca big concern\u201d and it could derail the company\u2019s plans to introduce a hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2035. Airbus announced plans in December to test a hydrogen-powered fuel cell engine on an A380 in 2026. Days before Airbus\u2019 announcement, Rolls-Royce and budget airline EasyJet said they had successfully converted a regular airplane engine to run on liquid hydrogen fuel \u2013 a world first, they claimed. Meanwhile, other companies are developing technology that aims to deliver electric planes. Miftakhov told CNN in 2020 that compared to even the \u201cwildest predictions for battery technology,\u201d hydrogen has greater potential than all-electric rivals for emissions-free flying. Meanwhile, ZeroAvia\u2019s Dornier 228 will conduct a series of test flights from Kemble, in the UK\u2019s Lake District, before moving on to demonstration flights from other airports.      Miftakhov said in a statement: \u201cThis is a major moment, not just for ZeroAvia, but for the aviation industry as a whole, as it shows that true zero-emission commercial flight is only a few years away.  \u201cThe first flight of our 19-seat aircraft shows just how scalable our technology is and highlights the rapid progress of zero-emission propulsion. This is only the beginning \u2013 we are building the future of sustainable, zero climate impact aviation.\u201d In a press conference, calling it \u201can outstanding day, not just for ZeroAvia or aviation but for the world,\u201d he added:  \u201cAviation\u2019s [contribution] is becoming larger and larger to climate change and we really need solutions.\u201d The fast-growing industry accounts for 2.1% of manmade carbon emissions worldwide, according to the Air Transport Action Group, and 3.5% of planet-warming emissions in total.  \u201cToday we have witnessed a major step towards achieving that goal [of decarbonization],\u201d he said in the press conference.  \u201cThere\u2019s still a way to go but let\u2019s celebrate the achievement.\u201d",

Its namesake is Captain Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger, who became famous for landing a plane safely on the Hudson River in 2009. Sullenberger\u2019s quick thinking as the aircraft encountered a bird strike made him a hero, and the incident was dubbed \u201cthe Miracle on the Hudson.\u201d The Sullenberger Aviation Museum is due to reopen in late 2023, with a groundbreaking ceremony scheduled for September 27. The plane he piloted, US Airways Flight 1549, was en route from New York City to Charlotte, North Carolina \u2013 where the museum is located. Many of its passengers live in and around Charlotte, and the aircraft is the museum\u2019s best-known exhibit. One of the US Airways Flight 1549 passengers was Ric Elias, the Charlotte-based CEO of Red Ventures, who contributed significant funds to the museum. \u201cFlight 1549 changed the course of my life and gave me the ultimate gift of a second chance,\u201d Elias said in a statement. \u201cThe Museum is a tribute to the courage of Captain Sullenberger and the entire flight crew, and my hope is that it will also inspire young innovators to change the world.\u201d    The reimagined museum will include a new exhibition area focusing on advances made in the aviation industry as well as programs to get young people interested in studying science, tech and math.  \u201cI feel privileged that my name will be associated with such an awe-inspiring institution that is actively working to expand social, cultural and economic mobility in Charlotte and beyond,\u201d Sullenberger, who retired in 2010, said in a statement. He added: \u201cit is our hope that as more than a collection of aircraft, the Sullenberger Aviation Museum will serve as a vehicle of opportunity to inspire and elevate the next generation of innovators and future heroes.\u201d A biopic based on Sullenberger\u2019s life and the events around the Miracle on the Hudson, \u201cSully,\u201d was released in 2016. It was directed by Clint Eastwood and starred Tom Hanks in the title role.  Top: Sullenberger poses in front of the \u201cMiracle on the Hudson\u201d plane.

            "text": "Greener commercial flight technology may be on the horizon.  NASA and Boeing will work together on the Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project to build, test and fly an emission-reducing single-aisle aircraft this decade, according to an announcement from the agency on Wednesday.  \u201cSince the beginning, NASA has been with you when you fly. NASA has dared to go farther, faster, higher. And in doing so, NASA has made aviation more sustainable and dependable. It is in our DNA,\u201d said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson in a statement.  \u201cIt\u2019s our goal that NASA\u2019s partnership with Boeing to produce and test a full-scale demonstrator will help lead to future commercial airliners that are more fuel efficient, with benefits to the environment, the commercial aviation industry, and to passengers worldwide. If we are successful, we may see these technologies in planes that the public takes to the skies in the 2030s.\u201d  The first test flight of this experimental aircraft is set to take place in 2028. The goal is for the technology to serve approximately 50% of the commercial market through short- to medium-haul single-aisle aircraft, Nelson said. Airlines largely rely on single-aisle aircraft, which account for nearly half of aviation emissions worldwide, according to NASA. Developing new technology to reduce fuel use can support the Biden administration\u2019s goal of achieving net-zero aviation carbon emissions by 2050, as laid out in the US Aviation Climate Action Plan.  Boeing estimates that the demand for the new single-aisle aircraft will increase by 40,000 planes between 2035 and 2050.   The design that NASA and Boeing are working on could reduce fuel consumption and emissions by up to 30% compared with today\u2019s most efficient aircraft, according to the agency. It\u2019s called the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing concept, which relies on elongated, thin wings stabilized by diagonal struts that connect the wings to the aircraft. The design\u2019s shape creates less drag, which means burning less fuel. The Sustainable Flight Demonstrator will also incorporate other green aviation technologies.   \u201cNASA is working toward an ambitious goal of developing game-changing technologies to reduce aviation energy use and emissions over the coming decades toward an aviation community goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,\u201d said Bob Pearce, NASA associate administrator for the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, in a statement.  \u201cThe Transonic Truss-Braced Wing is the kind of transformative concept and investment we will need to meet those challenges and, critically, the technologies demonstrated in this project have a clear and viable path to informing the next generation of single-aisle aircraft, benefiting everyone that uses the air transportation system.\u201d The benefits of increasing the aspect ratio of the wing have been known for a long time, but the challenge of structuring the design has required advancements in materials and construction to reach this point of development, Pearce said.  By partnering on the project, NASA and Boeing can take on more risks than the aviation industry can do on its own, he said.  \u201cThis is an experimental aircraft,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a commercial development of an aircraft that passengers are going to fly in today. And the reason we need to do this is because this is high-risk technology. We\u2019re trying to validate technology.\u201d The partnership, supported by the Funded Space Act Agreement, will rely on technical expertise and facilities and $425 million from NASA over seven years. Meanwhile, Boeing and its partners will contribute the remaining $725 million and the technical plan. \u201cWe\u2019re honored to continue our partnership with NASA and to demonstrate technology that significantly improves aerodynamic efficiency resulting in substantially lower fuel burn and emissions,\u201d said Todd Citron, Boeing chief technology officer.

            "title": "How to recycle the world\u2019s largest passenger plane",
            "text": "The Airbus A380 entered service nearly two decades ago, but although passengers loved it, it was doomed from the start. Too big and too expensive for airlines to run due to its four engines, it quickly fell out of favor, surpassed by more fuel-efficient twin-engine jets. After its debut in 2005, Airbus ended up building only 251 A380s \u2013 far fewer than it originally intended \u2013 and production ended in late 2021. Although most of them are still flying, amid a post-Covid resurgence of the aircraft, several have already been scrapped or recycled \u2013 way ahead of the usual schedule for a passenger aircraft. \u201cThe A380 is certainly one of the youngest aircraft getting recycled,\u201d says Geoff Van Klaveren, an aviation analyst at advisory firm IBA. \u201cNormally a commercial aircraft can be expected to be in operation for 25 years before being scrapped.\u201d Only a handful of companies are capable of recycling the world\u2019s biggest passenger plane, and the most experienced is Tarmac Aerosave, which has recycled over 300 aircraft since it was founded in 2007, across three sites in France and Spain. The company, which is partly owned by Airbus itself, has already recycled six A380s. It is currently working on a seventh, which will be completed in March.     Tarmac won\u2019t say exactly which airlines these A380 used to fly with, but Van Klaveren reckons they likely came from Air France, Singapore Airlines and Emirates. It\u2019s not an easy job. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to scrap an A380 in the sense that there is a limited market for the parts,\u201d he says.  \u201cThat said, being an aluminum frame, it\u2019s easier than a composite aircraft such as the A350 or the Boeing 787, where currently there is no way to recycle the airframe and it is simply cut into pieces and either buried or stored.\u201d   Recycling the superjumbo   How do you recycle such a huge airplane, and what happens to the resulting parts and materials? \u201cRecycling starts by reusing and extending the life of the different components of the aircraft, as you do at your home,\u201d says Lionel Roques, sales director at Tarmac Aerosave. \u201cSo the first step is to take out some pieces that will continue flying on another aircraft.\u201d These include the engines, the landing gear and some of the avionics \u2013 the electronic components of the aircraft that handle tasks like communications or navigation. These parts are checked and resold with complete traceability, guaranteeing their airworthiness. In the case of A380 parts, they become spare components for the existing fleet of A380s. They can also be used for training purposes. \u201cSometimes we can give them to schools or training facilities so that new mechanics or students coming into the industry can train on real parts,\u201d says Roques. This part of the process generally lasts a few weeks. Once it\u2019s completed, they move on to the next stage: waste management. \u201cThis is where we separate all the different materials, whether it\u2019s aluminum, titanium or copper, and make sure that we give them to the proper recovery channels that will reuse them in something new tomorrow,\u201d says Roques.   Due to the massive size of the A380, which has 120 tons of aluminum alone, this phase lasts months, and is particularly challenging. Roques explains: \u201cBecause it\u2019s such a large aircraft, you need a large facility, and you need to adapt your tooling and your methods to something that\u2019s very big. You also have to be careful in terms of safety and work environment, because when you\u2019ve got a mechanic working on the second deck of the aircraft, that\u2019s really high.\u201d Tarmac says that it commits to recycling \u201cup to the last screw,\u201d and although no specific regulations exist in the field, it aims to recover over 90% of the aircraft by weight. \u201cThe remaining waste is as minimal as possible. Of course, some composite material or some dangerous goods that cannot be recycled will remain, but we\u2019re talking about a small percentage, like 1% to 3%, that will be residual waste or go to landfill,\u201d adds Roques. The cost of the operation is in the \u201csix figure\u201d region, he says. It\u2019s heavily dependent on the number of parts that need to be removed from the aircraft \u2013 and that can vary based on the requirements of the client.   Upcycling for avgeeks   But there\u2019s also a different way of doing things: upcycling. Or as Roques puts it: \u201cTaking out parts that are iconic or interesting to use as decorative elements.\u201d Late last year, Airbus did just that in a bid to raise money for charity, and auctioned off hundreds of parts from a former Emirates A380.    This gave aviation enthusiasts a chance to buy almost every piece of the plane, from smaller items like doorstops, seatbelts, handrails, exit signs, latches, lamps, curtains and kettles to bulky ones including entire seat rows, staircases, drinks carts and engine parts, some of which came in special editions painted by a range of artists.  The most desirable item, however, was a full business cabin bar, measuring over seven feet high, which has become one of the symbols of the airplane in its lavish Emirates configuration. It sold for about $50,000.   An irreplaceable aircraft   A380 parts derived from recycling will long be needed to support the existing fleet of the aircraft, especially as more and more airlines bring their superjumbos back into service. The latest to do so was Qantas, which revived one of its own after two years of storage. Meanwhile both Etihad and Lufthansa are expected to bring part of their dormant A380 fleets back into service in early 2023. \u201cThe life of the A380 is not written yet, and to support the operation you need spare parts. The fact that we are now dismantling aircraft and putting spare parts into the market will support an extended operation of the plane,\u201d says Roques. He believes that in the future, A380 operators will consolidate, leaving just one for each major region: British Airways for transatlantic, Emirates in the Middle East, Qantas in Oceania and Singapore in Asia.  He also thinks that we\u2019ll never see the aircraft\u2019s like again. \u201cIt\u2019s an unmatched and unique aircraft, and its life will be extended as much as possible \u2013 but I don\u2019t see something ever replacing it.\u201d",

            "text": "Rich travelers will have to pay more to fly if the aviation industry is to transition to greener fuels, the boss of one of the world\u2019s biggest airports said Tuesday. Speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos hosted by CNN\u2019s Richard Quest, Heathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said that wealthy individuals and companies should pay extra to fly with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in order to bring the costs down for everyone else, particularly people in developing countries. He said that financiers and energy suppliers should invest in SAF production, including in emerging markets. \u201cBut as individuals and companies we need to be paying the premium for sustainable aviation fuels so that we can get the cost of it down so that the mass market and developing countries don\u2019t have to pay for the energy transition. The wealthy people in this room and wealthy nations should be funding the energy transition in aviation to help support developing countries,\u201d he added. Holland-Kaye said the solution to sustainable aviation was not to fly less, which was not necessarily an option outside Northern Europe, but to use cleaner sources of energy to travel.  SAF is viewed as critical to reducing aviation\u2019s carbon emissions but its green credentials come at a hefty price. Some airlines allow passengers to offset their CO2 emissions by paying more for their tickets to cover the extra cost of using SAF, but very few travelers currently make use of this option. Holland-Kaye said that companies can play a major role accelerating the adoption of SAF because business travel accounts for about 30% of fuel used in aviation. He cited the example of Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT), which has an internal carbon tax for travel that requires each business unit to pay a fee based on its carbon emissions. Produced mainly from recycled food and agricultural waste, such as used cooking oil, SAF is a type of biofuel that cuts greenhouse gas emissions by 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. It also costs between two and eight times more than its fossil-fuel based alternative, which is why in 2019 it accounted for just 0.1% of jet fuel used in commercial aviation, according to a report by the World Economic Forum and McKinsey.  In 2021, the industry pledged to replaced 10% of global jet fuel supply with SAF by 2030. This year, Virgin Atlantic plans to fly a Boeing 787 from London to New York powered solely by SAF in what has been billed as the world\u2019s first net-zero transatlantic flight. Clean energy investments need a major boost if the world is to meet its climate goals, according to Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has prompted a surge in investment in renewables as countries race to secure alternative energy supplies, but much more needs to be done, he said. Speaking on another Davos panel hosted by CNN\u2019s Julia Chatterley earlier on Tuesday, Birol said that for every dollar invested in fossil fuels, the world is now investing $1.50 in clean energy. That needs to increase to $9 to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, he added. \u2014 Anna Cooban contributed reporting. ",

Investment banking powerhouses Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley both reported substantial drops in revenue and profit for the fourth quarter on Tuesday, largely due to the dearth of merger activity and initial public offerings in the final three months of the year.  Earnings for Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) missed by their widest margin since the third quarter of 2011. Revenue tumbled 16% for Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) in the fourth quarter, and profits plunged 66%. Morgan Stanley\u2019s\n            \n                (MS) revenue fell 12% from a year ago while earnings were down nearly 40%. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in the company\u2019s earnings release that the company faced \u201ca challenging economic backdrop.\u201d Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman called it \u201ca difficult market environment.\u201d Goldman Sachs said that investment banking fees plummeted 48% in the fourth quarter from the same period in 2021, as acquisition activity dried up and fewer companies looked to raise money by selling stock or issuing debt. Morgan Stanley was hit by the slowdown too, with investment banking revenue dropping 49% from a year ago. Research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence said Tuesday that only 20 IPOs made it to market in the United States during the fourth quarter last year, down from 234 in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Despite a strong market rally in October and November, stocks ended the fourth quarter with a thud, sliding in December. And Wall Street suffered its worst year since 2008. That made companies less willing to go shopping for acquisitions, too. \u201cFourth-quarter 2022 M&A activity marked a weak end to a depressed year in North America as rising interest rates and a slowing economy dissuaded companies from expanding,\u201d S&P Global Market Intelligence said in a report. Morgan Stanley\u2019s overall revenue and earnings topped analysts\u2019 forecasts though, while Goldman Sachs posted revenue also missed Wall Street\u2019s targets. Shares of Morgan Stanley were up about 7% in midday trading Tuesday. Goldman Sachs, a Dow component, fell nearly 7%. Both investment banking titans did report some bright spots though. Morgan Stanley said that revenue for its wealth management unit was up 6% from a year ago.  Goldman Sachs also posted strong revenue gains for its small, consumer-oriented banking business. Goldman Sachs disclosed in a regulatory filing last week, however, that this division has lost more than $3 billion since 2020. During a conference call with analysts Tuesday, Solomon said that Goldman Sachs will no longer offer new loans on its Marcus consumer platform, adding that the company has \u201cnarrowed our ambitions on our consumer strategy.\u201d Both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are trying to attract more \u201cMain Street\u201d customers in order to expand beyond trading, investment banking and other traditional Wall Street businesses. But it\u2019s been a tough time for all financial services companies. Rising interest rates, tumbling home prices and concerns about an imminent recession are hitting all banks hard. JPMorgan Chase\n            \n                (JPM), Citigroup\n            \n                (C), Wells Fargo\n            \n                (WFC) and Bank of America\n            \n                (BAC) all reported mixed results last week and gave mostly cautious outlooks about the economy. Still, Gorman was hopeful that there will be a resurgence in deals later this year. He said he believes that once the Federal Reserve stops hiking interest rates \u2014 which many investors believe may happen later this year if inflation pressures continue to abate \u2014 then companies will be more willing to make acquisitions or go public. \u201cI am highly confident that when the Fed pauses, deal activity and underwriting activity will go up. I would bet the year on that, in fact,\u201d he said during Morgan Stanley\u2019s conference call with analysts.",

            "text": "A Facebook Live video purportedly showing the last terrifying moments inside the cabin on Yeti Airlines flight 691 before it crashed in Nepal on Sunday has circulated widely online, as search and recovery efforts continue on the ground. The plane crashed while en route from the Nepalese capital Kathmandu to Pokhara, a tourist gateway to the Himalayas. There were 72 people on board, including four crew members, according to an airline spokesperson. With all but one body recovered, the crash marks the country\u2019s deadliest air disaster in more than 30 years. The search to locate the last remaining victim is ongoing, Anil Shahi, a local official, said Tuesday. The video was purportedly live streamed from inside the plane by a passenger, Sonu Jaiswal, with footage beginning moments before the plane crashed. It shows a plane window with the wing seen outside as the aircraft banks sharply to the left. At one point, seemingly unaware of the impending danger, Jaiswal turns the video to himself, smiling slightly amid chatter and laughter in the background. Several passengers can be heard conversing excitedly in a mix of Hindi and Punjabi; one person says, \u201cLook at that body of water, it\u2019s excellent,\u201d as the plane passes by a lake.  The mood inside the plane appears calm, with no emergency warnings from the pilot or airline crew. Seconds later, the video abruptly starts shaking with shouts heard; the camera loses focus, only showing flashes of light and loud noise, before the scene erupts in fire. CNN has corroborated the video based on geolocation, a flight manifest and information on the Yeti Airlines website.  Jaiswal is listed as a passenger on the flight manifest, and the seat number listed for him on the airline website matches the visuals taken from inside the plane. A close friend of Jaiswal in India, Arman Ansari, also confirmed it was Jaiswal seen in the video. He added that he was watching a Facebook Live stream from Jaiswal during the flight. \u201cWe were watching it. We had watched for just a few seconds and then it got cut. We did not think much about it,\u201d he said. Aryaka Akhouri, the chief of Gazipur district in India where Jaiswal lived, said she had spoken to Jaiswal\u2019s parents, and confirmed he was on the plane and the one filming the video. A spokesman for Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) has said the video is not from Sunday\u2019s crash. When pressed, he said he and his team had no technical evidence to support that claim. Instead, he pointed to passengers laughing at the first sign of turbulence before panic set in seconds later as evidence it could not be the Yeti Airlines flight. Aviation analyst Mary Schiavo told CNN the video could be helpful in the investigation, saying it could have captured details not recorded in the plane\u2019s black box. For instance, the aircraft\u2019s flap, which gives extra lift during landing, \u201cdoes not look like (it\u2019s) fully extended,\u201d she said.  She added that what seems to be the sound of an engine suggests \u201cthey had power to at least one engine.\u201d  Investigation ongoing Search and recovery efforts continued on Tuesday for the two people still missing, according to Nepali police. District police chief Ajaya KC said foggy weather was making the search difficult and authorities planned to use drones to locate those missing when the weather improves. Meanwhile, an investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing, with assistance from French investigators who will be on site by Tuesday. The plane\u2019s black box, which records flight data, was recovered on Monday and would be handed to CAAN, officials said. Aviation authorities said Tuesday that the pilot of the plane had asked air traffic controllers for a change of runway just minutes before the aircraft went down.  Pokhara airport has two runways that pilots can choose between when landing and the pilot\u2019s request had been accepted, CAAN spokesperson Jagannath Niroula said. \u201cWhen the Yeti Airlines pilot asked the tower if he can take the second runway to land, the tower approved it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tower controllers didn\u2019t ask why the pilot wanted to use a different runway than originally planned since it wasn\u2019t an issue technically from their end which runway the pilot chooses to land,\u201d Niroula told CNN. No distress calls were reported from the pilot to the Pokhara airport tower controllers, he added. In Kathmandu and Pokhara, crowds held candlelight vigils for the victims on Monday. Of the bodies recovered, at least 41 have been identified, Yeti Airlines said in a statement Monday. Some bodies will be handed over to their families in Pokhara, while others \u2013 including those of foreign nationals \u2013 will be airlifted to Kathmandu on Tuesday, police said. Fifteen foreign nationals were aboard, hailing from India, Russia, South Korea, Australia, Ireland, Argentina and France, according to CAAN. Videos on Monday showed grieving families in Pokhara, waiting outside the hospital where autopsies are being conducted. The postmortems were delayed because a team of forensic experts didn\u2019t reach Pokhara until Monday afternoon, according to police and airline officials. Some families have begun speaking out about the loss of their loved ones. In a statement Tuesday, the family of Australian victim Myron Love said the 29-year-old teacher had been a keen cyclist who \u201clived life to the fullest.\u201d",

Seventy-two people \u2013 four crew members and 68 passengers \u2013 were on board the ATR 72 plane operated by Nepal\u2019s Yeti Airlines when it crashed, Yeti Airlines spokesman Sudarshan Bartaula said. Thirty-seven were men, 25 were women, three were children and three were infants, Nepal\u2019s civil aviation authority reported. Search efforts were called off after dark, Army spokesman Krishna Prasad Bhandari said, and will resume Monday morning. Hundreds of first responders had been still working to locate the remaining four individuals before then, Bhandari said.  Sunday\u2019s incident was the third-deadliest crash in the Himalayan nation\u2019s history, according to data from the Aviation Safety Network. The only incidents in which more people were killed took place in July and September 1992. Those crashes involved aircraft run by Thai Airways and Pakistan International airlines and left 113 and 167 people dead, respectively.  The civil aviation authority said that 53 of the passengers and all four crew members were Nepali. Fifteen foreign nationals were on the plane as well: five were Indian, four were Russian and two were Korean. The rest were individual citizens of Australia, Argentina, France and Ireland.  The aircraft had been flying from the capital of Kathmandu to Pokhara, the country\u2019s second-most populous city and a gateway to the Himalayas, the country\u2019s state media The Rising Nepal reported. Pokhara is located some 129 kilometers (80 miles) west of Kathmandu. The plane was last in contact with Pokhara airport at about 10:50 a.m. local time. In the minutes before it attempted to land on Sunday, the pilot asked for a change of runway, a spokesperson for Pokhara airport told Reuters on Monday. \u201cThe permission was granted. \u201cWe don\u2019t ask (why), whenever a pilot asks we give permission to change approach,\u201d the spokesperson, Anup Joshi, told Reuters. First responders from the Nepal Army and various police departments have been deployed to the crash site and are carrying out a rescue operation, the civil aviation authorities said in a statement.  A video clip on social media on Sunday appeared to show the moments before the aircraft crashed. The film, which appears to be taken from rooftop of a house in Pokhara, shows the plane flying low over a populated area and rolling on its side before the aircraft is no longer visible in the clip. A loud explosion can be heard at the end of the video.   CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the clip.    A five-member committee has also been formed to investigate the cause of the crash. The quintet must submit a report to the government within 45 days, according to Nepal\u2019s deputy prime minister and government spokesperson Bishnu Paudel.    Nepal\u2019s Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal said he was \u201cdeeply saddened by the sad and tragic accident.\u201d \u201cI sincerely appeal to the security personnel, all agencies of the Nepal government and the general public to start an effective rescue,\u201d Dahal said on Twitter. The government declared Monday a public holiday to mourn the victims, a spokesman for the prime minister said.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin both conveyed their condolences, as did Australia\u2019s ambassador to Nepal. Nepal\u2019s Yeti Airlines said it was canceling all regular flights on Monday, January 16, in mourning for the victims of the crash.   The French Civil Aviation Safety agency will aid in an investigation the crash, it said Monday, adding that four French investigators will be on site by Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Russian Investigative Committee has opened a criminal case to establish the circumstances of the crash, the agency said in a statement Monday.     The Himalayan country of Nepal, home to eight of the world\u2019s 14 highest mountains, including Everest, has a record of air accidents. Its weather can change suddenly and airstrips are typically sited in difficult-to-reach mountainous areas. Last May, a Tara Air flight carrying 22 people crashed into a Himalayan mountain at an altitude of about 14,500 feet. That was the country\u2019s 19th plane crash in 10 years and its 10th fatal one during the same period, according to the Aviation Safety Network database. The aircraft involved in Sunday\u2019s crash was an ATR 72-500, a twin-prop turbojet often used in the Asia-Pacific region, especially among low-cost carriers. Planes made by ATR, a joint partnership between European aeronautics companies Airbus and Leonardo, typically have a good reputation.  However, they have been involved in crashes before. Two ATR 72s operated by the now-defunct Taiwanese airline Transasia were involved in deadly crashes in July 2014 and February 2015. The second prompted Taiwanese authorities to temporarily ground all ATR 72\u2019s registered on the island. In total, the ATR 72\u2019s various models had been involved in 11 fatal incidents before Sunday\u2019s crash in Nepal, according to the Aviation Safety Network.  ATR said in a statement Sunday that it had been informed of the accident. \u201cOur first thoughts are with all the individuals affected by this,\u201d the statement read. \u201cATR specialists are fully engaged to support both the investigation and the customer.\u201d",

            "text": "SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy rocket, the towering launch vehicle known for its boosters\u2019 aerial acrobatics and synchronized landings when returning to Earth, took to the skies Sunday, delivering national security payloads to orbit for the US military. The mission, called USSF-67, took off at 5:56 p.m. ET from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, marking the fifth successful flight of the rocket recently dethroned as the world\u2019s most powerful operational launch vehicle. This mission was initially advertised to launch on Saturday, and the reason for the one-day delay was not immediately clear. The Falcon Heavy debuted to much fanfare in 2018 when SpaceX CEO Elon Musk attached his personal Tesla Roadster as a test payload on the launch. The car is still in space, taking an oblong path around the sun that swings out as far as Mars\u2019 orbital path. The rocket followed up that test mission with two launches in 2019 before taking a three-year hiatus;  the vast majority of SpaceX\u2019s missions don\u2019t require the Falcon Heavy\u2019s amped-up power. On the other hand, SpaceX\u2019s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket launched more than 60 times in 2022 alone, sending two groups of astronauts to space as well as Starlink satellites and a variety of other spacecraft. But SpaceX is now making good on lucrative military launch contracts it signed for the Falcon Heavy years ago. The rocket returned to flight in November with the launch of the US military\u2019s USSF-44 mission, and Sunday\u2019s liftoff was a follow-up to that display. \u201cUSSF-44 included six payloads on one satellite that advance communications, space weather sensing, and other technologies into near-geosynchronous orbits,\u201d according to the military\u2019s Space Operations Command. And USSF-67 will make use of the same type of spacecraft deployed on USSF-44, called LDPE, which is essentially a bus for outer space that can carry smaller satellites. The Falcon Heavy also carried a communications satellite, called the Continuous Broadcast Augmenting SATCOM, for the US Space Force. Additional details about the satellites on Sunday\u2019s mission were not immediately available.  With each launch, the Falcon Heavy rocket puts on a dramatic show back on Earth.  After Sunday\u2019s mission, the company recovered two of the Falcon Heavy rocket\u2019s first-stage boosters \u2014 the tall white sticks strapped together to give the rocket its heightened power at liftoff. After expending most of their fuel, the side boosters fell away from the center core and reoriented themselves to slice back through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. As they approached the ground, the boosters reignited their engines and completed a synchronized landing on ground pads near the Florida coastline. It\u2019s a signature move for SpaceX, which routinely recovers and reuses its rocket boosters to drive down the cost of launches.  SpaceX did not attempt to recover the center booster because of fuel requirements. The company hasn\u2019t successfully retrieved all three boosters yet, although it\u2019s come close. The two side boosters made a pinpoint, synchronized landing on ground pads after an April 2019 mission, and the rocket\u2019s center booster touched down on a seafaring platform. But rough waves toppled it over. All about this rocket For years, the Falcon Heavy was the world\u2019s most powerful operational rocket. But in November, NASA\u2019s new moon rocket, called Space Launch System, or SLS, stole that title with its inaugural launch. SLS launched the uncrewed Artemis 1 mission around the moon, paving the way for future missions with astronauts on board. While the Falcon Heavy gives off about 5 million pounds of thrust, SLS is puts out as much as 8.8 million pounds of thrust \u2014 15% more than the Saturn V rockets that powered the Apollo moon landings.  At its experimental facilities in South Texas, SpaceX is in the final stages of preparing for the first orbital launch attempt of its Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket. Though the test flight still awaits final approval from federal regulators, it could lift off in the coming weeks. If successful, SpaceX\u2019s Starship would dethrone the SLS as the most powerful rocket flying today. The Starship system is expected to outpower both SLS and Falcon Heavy. The forthcoming Super Heavy booster, which is designed to vault the Starship spacecraft into space, is expected to put off about 17 million pounds of thrust. It\u2019s not all a competition, however. Both the SLS rocket and SpaceX\u2019s Starship are integral to NASA\u2019s plans to return astronauts to the moon\u2019s surface for the first time in half a century.  SpaceX has its own, ambitious vision for the Starship: ferrying humans and cargo to Mars in hopes of one day establishing a permanent human settlement there. ",

Phillip Washington, Biden\u2019s pick to lead the FAA, has yet to receive a confirmation hearing in the Democratic-controlled Senate.  \u201cThere is no doubt about it: it\u2019s time to clear the runway for President Biden\u2019s choice for FAA Administrator, Phil Washington. With recent events, including airline troubles and last week\u2019s tech problem, this agency needs a leader confirmed by the Senate immediately,\u201d Schumer said in a statement Sunday. \u201cI intend to break this logjam, work to hold a hearing for Mr. Washington, where he can detail his experience and answer questions and then work towards a speedy Senate confirmation.\u201d Washington has faced questions about his limited aviation experience and, in September, was named in a search warrant issued as part of a political corruption investigation in Los Angeles. But Schumer\u2019s Sunday announcement appears to show he\u2019s prepared to push past those issues.  If confirmed, Washington would be the first Black permanent administrator of the agency. He is currently the CEO of Denver International Airport \u2013 the third-busiest airport in the world. Washington previously held leadership roles a municipal transit organizations, including in Denver and Los Angeles, focused on bus and rail lines. Because his nomination wasn\u2019t acted upon during the last Congress, Biden faced a choice this year of whether to resubmit his name for consideration or identify a new nominee. Biden renominated Washington earlier this month, signaling the administration\u2019s continued support for him.  The FAA has been without a permanent administrator since March, when former President Donald Trump\u2019s appointee, Stephen Dickson, stepped down midway through his five-year term. The agency is facing increased scrutiny after it was forced to ground thousands of flights starting Wednesday when air traffic control officials opted to shutdown the central database for all NOTAMs (Notice to Air Missions) nationwide after they found a corrupt file in the system. That plan and the outage led to massive flight delays and the first nationwide stop of air traffic in more than 20 years.",

            "text": "The massively disruptive computer outage at the Federal Aviation Administration this week that caused thousands of cancelled or delayed flights has put Americans uncomfortably face-to-face with the technology behind US air travel \u2014 for at least the second time in a month.   As the country once again picks up the pieces, beleaguered air travelers may be wondering why flying suddenly seems so vulnerable to devastating IT problems.   The answer involves not just aging hardware and software, but also institutional failures that have made updating the technology more challenging, according to current and former industry officials, government reports and outside analysts.   Over the years \u2014 and in the face of exploding demand for air travel \u2014 bureaucratic snafus and deferred maintenance have contributed to an increasingly brittle system, even as it grows ever more sophisticated with far more points of failure than many consumers may realize.   Southwest Airlines\u2019 recent days-long collapse of its entire system \u2014 in the middle of a winter storm and during the most critical travel period of the year, no less \u2014 and Wednesday\u2019s widespread flight disruptions may have put many of these problems front and center for US passengers, but they are just the latest manifestation of a longstanding and enormously complicated issue.   Airline travelers get a month from Hell  The glitch at the center of this week\u2019s headache was a corrupted database file in a pilots\u2019 advisory system that issues warnings, known as NOTAMs, of various hazards that could affect a flight, ranging from notices of closed runways to the presence of nearby construction equipment. The damaged file was also present in the FAA\u2019s backup system, a source familiar with the matter told CNN, which first reported the detail on Wednesday.   Officials moved to reboot the main NOTAM system early Wednesday morning, but it failed to be completely restored by the time rush hour began on the East Coast, leading to the FAA ground stop. A senior US official told CNN Wednesday there was no evidence of foul play in the incident, a detail the FAA later publicly confirmed.  \u201cThe FAA is continuing a thorough review to determine the root cause of the Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) system outage,\u201d the agency said in a statement Wednesday evening. \u201cOur preliminary work has traced the outage to a damaged database file. At this time, there is no evidence of a cyberattack. The FAA is working diligently to further pinpoint the causes of this issue and take all needed steps to prevent this kind of disruption from happening again.\u201d The FAA said Thursday evening that the data file \u201cwas damaged by personnel who failed to follow procedures.\u201d   The NOTAM issue occurred just days after the FAA had said an \u201cair traffic computer issue\u201d was responsible for hours-long flight delays to Florida airports on Jan. 2. That system, known as ERAM, is responsible for tracking hundreds of flights at a time and is considered a critical component of the FAA\u2019s efforts to modernize the US airspace.   In the case of Southwest, outdated scheduling systems that could not automatically adjust to disruptions caused by severe winter weather required painstaking manual intervention, which made the weather-related problems at that airline particularly pronounced.  \u2018Old, old systems\u2019  Despite moving to modernize their equipment, in some cases airlines and the US government may still be reliant on technology that could be years or even decades old.  The FAA software that failed this week is 30 years old and at least six years away from being updated, a US government official told CNN on Thursday, though Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has pushed to accelerate that timeline since the meltdown, the official said.   The notices issued by FAA\u2019s NOTAM system are \u201cJurassic,\u201d said Kathleen Bangs, a former airline pilot and aviation expert. \u201cIt\u2019s a clumsy system that often over-burdens pilots with pages and pages of less-than-urgent notices, written in archaic code that sometimes buries that one, critical piece of safety information a pilot really needs.\u201d The FAA has acknowledged the NOTAM system\u2019s age. In its most recent budget request to Congress, the agency called for money to help \u201celiminate the failing vintage hardware\u201d behind it.  As early as 2012, the FAA decided it wanted to replace aging legacy voice switches used in air traffic control communications with new, internet-based communications technology. But thanks to a contracting dispute, the FAA now intends to keep using the old switches until at least 2030, according to a Transportation Department Inspector General report last year.  The ERAM air traffic system at the center of the disruptions on Jan. 2 is much younger, and only became fully operational in 2015. But according to a 2020 Inspector General report, the system was supposed to have been fully implemented five years prior, as a replacement to another system that had already been running for more than 40 years. The FAA is currently working to update ERAM\u2019s hardware and software, following at least seven ERAM failures since 2014, a track record that has prompted congressional scrutiny. But it may not be until 2026 that the ERAM upgrade is complete, according to the 2020 report.  Meanwhile, many of the IT systems that airlines depend upon were custom-built long ago, with some running on legacy mainframe computers, and weren\u2019t designed to handle enormous surges of incoming information, aviation experts said.   \u201cThis is not your standard Windows server or modern VMware architecture,\u201d said Seth Miller, an IT consultant, aviation journalist and editor of the travel publication PaxExAero. \u201cThese are old, old systems.\u201d  As a result, acute crises can easily overwhelm these fragile setups, according to an aviation industry official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the issue more freely.  \u201cThese systems were built at a time when the airlines may have been smaller, and they weren\u2019t necessarily built to handle so much data coming in at once,\u201d the official said. \u201cWhen you have something like the massive winter storm over the holidays, it cannot handle the volume of changes coming in at one time, because it\u2019s on a system that wasn\u2019t built to handle that large of a moving dataset.\u201d  It\u2019s not always that the technology\u2019s age is inherently a problem, industry experts said. It\u2019s what the age implies: An inability to scale to meet new demand, and a lack of proper support as the rest of the world moves on. The use of custom-built technology, as opposed to off-the-shelf solutions, exacerbates the problem, Miller said, as maintaining it requires increasingly specialized parts and know-how.  Trying to integrate old systems with newer ones \u2014 always in real time, because the global aviation industry never sleeps \u2014 can also create its own opportunities for catastrophic mistakes.  Many ways to fail  While all flight delays and cancellations tend to result in a similar experience for the air traveler, the underlying source of an outage can vary wildly. Many more things can go wrong than you might expect \u2014 highlighting the sheer complexity of the aviation industry, and underscoring how there isn\u2019t a quick easy fix for IT-related travel disruptions.  Getting a flight off the ground involves a complex stew of information, industry experts say, and disruptions in any part of that information supply chain can cause delays.   The vulnerabilities are magnified due to the tremendous number of companies involved in the ecosystem \u2014 not just the airlines, but their vendors, and their vendors\u2019 vendors.   \u201cThere\u2019s so many various systems speaking to each other,\u201d said Ross Feinstein, a former spokesperson for American Airlines and the Transportation Security Administration.   For example, Feinstein said, the TSA vets airline manifests. \u201cIf TSA has an outage, it halts the vetting process for reservations, which means passengers can\u2019t check in, and they can\u2019t retrieve a boarding pass. It could be the weather company has a disruption, and pilots can\u2019t retrieve the latest weather data for their departure, en route, or arrival.\u201d  In 2019, computer issues at a third-party company whose flight-planning tools help airlines calculate weight and balance for their aircraft led to delays for multiple airlines nationwide.  In 2021, an outage at Sabre, one of the world\u2019s largest airline reservation companies, caused disruptions globally.  The interconnected nature of the aviation sector, involving dozens of countries, companies, agencies and databases creates multiple points of failure. Backups and redundancies can help, but it is still a massively complex system of systems.  Bureaucratic challenges  Beneath the surface-level symptoms of the aviation sector\u2019s IT problems are deeper, messier and more human challenges.   Take the FAA\u2019s attempt to replace its air traffic voice switches. According to the Inspector General report, a major source of the breakdown came when the FAA and its potential vendor got into a dispute over the contract requirements. The dispute focused on possible software defects in the new switches, and whether the vendor could still deliver a good product on time.   The root of the issue was not, in itself, a technological problem. It was a procurement problem. But it has had lasting effects on FAA technology. The contract\u2019s eventual termination means the FAA will need to spend more than $270 million through 2030 to keep using its aging legacy voice switches, the report said.   \u201cContinued reliance on these switches creates the risk that communication will be disrupted,\u201d the report concluded.  A similar dynamic has played out in the debate over 5G wireless technology near airports, which last year threatened to cause major disruptions. Bureaucratic divisions and years of deferred avionics upgrades led to a crisis where US aircraft were not equipped with technology that could handle potential 5G interference.  Meanwhile, the FAA continues to be led by an acting administrator, and lacks a Senate-confirmed chief. That has real-world consequences for IT upgrades and other projects, according to a person familiar with the agency, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter more freely.  \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to set direction and vision when you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be there for a week or you\u2019re going to be there for 18 months,\u201d the person said.  Much of the aviation industry\u2019s unpaid technical debt, meanwhile, can be traced to a spate of mergers and bankruptcies in the wake of 9/11, when many airlines were more focused on finances than technological upgrades, said the industry official.   That bureaucratic myopia is its own cause of today\u2019s technological malaise in the aviation industry. In some situations, institutional inertia and commercial priorities have outranked investments in costly and boring infrastructure.  But the increasingly interconnected and digitized nature of the system now means that when things go wrong, they can do so in ever more disastrous ways.  Aviation experts say only more investment, and better planning, can meet the challenge.   \u201c[The FAA] is doing more with less resources, and they need more funding to modernize,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cIn Washington, we\u2019ll talk about it for the next 24 to 48 hours, forget about it, and it\u2019ll be a fight again when the FAA reauthorization bill comes up.\u201d  -- CNN\u2019s Pete Muntean, Gregory Wallace and Marnie Hunter contributed to this report",

Trading was choppy, with most bank stocks falling at the open before rebounding. Shares of JPMorgan Chase\n            \n                (JPM) were up about 2.5% in late afternoon trading while BofA\n            \n                (BAC) was up 2%. Wells Fargo\n            \n                (WFC), which reported earnings that missed Wall Street\u2019s targets, reversed earlier losses and was up 3%.

Investors might have been concerned by the downbeat tone of the big banks. Executives are clearly still worried about inflation and the threat of a recession this year following several big interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in the bank\u2019s earnings statement that although the economy is still strong and that consumers and businesses are spending and healthy, \u201cwe still do not know the ultimate effect of the headwinds coming from geopolitical tensions including the war in Ukraine, the vulnerable state of energy and food supplies, persistent inflation that is eroding purchasing power and has pushed interest rates higher.\u201d  The bank added in the earnings release that it now expects a \u201cmild recession\u201d as a base economic case. CFO Jeremy Barnum added during a conference call with reporters that in addition to the slowdown that has already started in its home lending unit, it is starting to see \u201cheadwinds\u201d in auto lending. Meanwhile, BofA CEO Brian Moynihan noted that this is \u201can increasingly slowing economic environment\u201d and Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said \u201cwe are carefully watching the impact of higher rates on our customers.\u201d Wells Fargo recently announced plans to pull back on its massive mortgage business. Banks are clearly worried about a looming recession, and Wall Street has taken notice. Moody\u2019s Investors Service analyst Peter Nerby noted in a report that \u201ccredit provisions are rising\u201d at JPMorgan Chase and that Citi \u201cbuilt capital and reserves in anticipation of a slowdown in core markets.\u201d The Fed\u2019s rate hikes aren\u2019t helping either. \u201cHigher than expected interest rates pose a significant risk to the outlook for credit quality, loan growth and net interest margins,\u201d said David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, in an email. Concerns about the economy were one reason why stocks plunged in 2022, suffering their worst year since 2008. As a result of the Wall Street slump, there was a major slowdown in merger activity and initial public offerings.  That hurt the investment banking businesses for the top banks. JPMorgan Chase and Citi each said that advisory fees plummeted nearly 60% in the quarter. Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) and Morgan Stanley\n            \n                (MS) will give more color about the health of Wall Street next Tuesday when they both report their fourth quarter results.  Goldman Sachs, which has aggressively built up a consumer banking unit over the past few years, has struggled to make money in that division. Goldman Sachs disclosed in a regulatory filing Friday that it has lost more than $3 billion in its consumer business since 2020. There were some signs of optimism though. BlackRock, which owns the massive iShares family of exchange-traded funds, reported a rebound in assets under management from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as stocks soared in October and November.  \u201cThe current environment offers incredible opportunities for long-term investors,\u201d said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in the earnings release.",

Bastian said he hopes the outage and massive disruption to air travel serves as \u201ca call to action amongst our political leaders\u201d to invest in FAA technology.    \u201cI think this is a crystal clear example of the challenge the FAA has faced when you have aging systems that aren\u2019t as resilient as they need to be,\u201d he said.  \u201cYou have tools and technologies that are somewhat outdated and staffing levels \u2013 not where they need to be.\u201d    Bastian echoed a call from some aviation voices to change the budgeting and funding method for the FAA \u2013 specifically, he said, to \u201ctake them off the kind of year by year funding it seems like they go through that\u2019s caught up in political negotiations.\u201d    Like most other federal government arms, FAA priorities can change depending on what Congress funds, and all but the most essential services close during a government shutdown.  Congress has the opportunity to consider such changes when it handles major aviation legislation this year.     Delta reported very strong fourth-quarter results Friday that beat forecasts, capping its first profitable year since before the pandemic. But a new labor deal with its pilots union will trim profitability going forward. The Atlanta-based airline said it expects first-quarter earnings per share of 15 to 40 cents, well below the consensus estimate of 55 cents. The main headwind: a new tentative labor agreement with its pilots union, reached a month ago, that will increase pay by 34% over the life of the contract. ",

            "text": "Delta Air Lines reported very strong fourth-quarter results Friday that beat forecasts, capping its first profitable year since before the pandemic. But a new labor deal with its pilots union will trim profitability going forward. The Atlanta-based airline said it expects first-quarter earnings per share of 15 to 40 cents, well below the consensus estimate of 55 cents. The main headwind: a new tentative labor agreement with its pilots union, reached a month ago, that will increase pay by 34% over the life of the contract.  While most employees at the major US airlines are represented by a union, the pilots are the only major employee group at Delta who are part of a union. Nearly 200,000 airline employees spread across the industry are expected to get substantial pay increases in upcoming labor negotiations later this year. Delta\n            \n                (DAL) said it still expects to earn between $5 and $6 a share for the full year, which is good compared to the consensus forecast of $5.08 a share. But the first-quarter guidance was enough to send shares of Delta\n            \n                (DAL) down more than 5% in premarket trading. Signs the air travel industry is recovering The results for the fourth quarter and full year mean Delta will pay out $563 million in profit sharing to its 90,000 employees. That\u2019s still only a third of the record amount it paid out in 2019, when profit-sharing checks were the equivalent of two months of pay for the average Delta employee. Still, the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year were very strong, a sign that the US air travel industry has greatly recovered from the losses of the first two years of the pandemic. Since Delta is the first airline to report fourth-quarter results, it is being watched as an indicator of what to expect from other airlines. American Airlines\n            \n                (AAL) gave guidance Thursday for its upcoming fourth-quarter results that was much better than expected. Delta earned $950 million, or $1.48 a share, excluding special items, in the quarter. Delta had issued guidance last month that it expected to earn between $1.35 to $1.40 a share in the period. Analysts had been forecasting earnings of $820 million, or $1.33 a share. One increased cost compared to 2019 is much higher jet fuel prices. The price per gallon Delta paid for fuel rose 61% compared to 2019, although the combination of fewer flights and more efficient planes helped it to trim fuel consumption by 13%. Fuel is the second largest cost for airlines, behind labor costs. Revenue reached $13.4 billion, up 17% from the fourth quarter of 2019, ahead of the outbreak of the pandemic, and more than $1 billion above the consensus forecast. That increased revenue came despite having 9% less capacity \u2014 a measure of available seats, adjusted for the distance traveled \u2014 than in the pre-pandemic fourth quarter of 2019. But strong demand for travel and limited capacity helped to drive fares higher. The average amount passengers paid to fly each mile on average rose 17% compared to 2019. Southwest\u2019s meltdown gave Delta a boost Rival Southwest Airlines\n            \n                (LUV) contributed to Delta\u2019s better-than-expected revenue, after Southwest had a meltdown in its service during the December holiday period that forced it to cancel nearly half of its flights. The debacle may cost that airline as much as $825 million \u2014  part of which comes from Southwest compensating passengers for tickets they bought on other airlines. \u201cThere were a lot of customers looking for airlines, given some of the Southwest challenges,\u201d Delta CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC in an interview Friday. Bastian said he doesn\u2019t blame the FAA for the problems with a computer system that grounded all airlines\u2019 flights nationwide for a period Wednesday morning. He called the issue \u201cunacceptable\u201d but said: \u201cI don\u2019t lay this on the FAA. I lay this on the fact that we\u2019re not giving them the resources, the funding, the staffing, the tools, the technology that they need to modernize,\u201d he said.  \u201cHopefully this will be the call to our political leaders in Washington that we need to do better,\u201d Bastian said.",

            "text": "America\u2019s largest financial institutions are pivoting into a new industry: Meteorology.  JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has already been very vocal in his ominous forecasts of storm clouds and hurricanes. Now, Goldman Sachs is joining him in the weather prediction business. The bank\u2019s investment strategy group is sending a message to clients looking for market guidance in 2023 \u2013 Caution: Heavy fog.  What\u2019s happening is that no one really knows what\u2019s happening.  The economic data is hazy \u2013 the December jobs report showed that wage growth slowed last month but that unemployment also shrank. Thursday\u2019s Consumer Price Index report found that the rate of inflation fell 0.1% between November and December but that core CPI, which strips out the volatile energy and food categories, was up 0.3% from the month before. Investors and economists attempting to predict when the Federal Reserve will pivot away from its painful inflation-fighting rate hikes or whether a soft, recession-less landing is possible are essentially reading tea leaves at this point.  In their 2023 outlook, Goldman analysts noted that disagreement about the economic forecast abounds within their own circles. Bill Dudley, a former Goldman Sachs partner and president of the New York Fed, puts the chance of recession this year at about 70%. Jan Hatzius, Goldman\u2019s chief economist and head of global investment research, says it\u2019s only 35%.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell has echoed the sentiment himself. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone knows whether we\u2019re going to have a recession or not,\u201d he said at a press conference after the central bank\u2019s December policy meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s just not knowable.\u201d   So what do investors do? Clients \u201cfacing the fog of uncertainty in financial markets, economic growth and geopolitics,\u201d should \u201cavoid unnecessary lane changes,\u201d and \u201callow extra time to reach your destination,\u201d wrote Goldman analysts. Instead of attempting to find a way out of the chaos, said analysts, investors should stay the course and wait for markets to eventually recover.  Equity markets are forward looking and tend to bottom about three months before recessions end, they said, and returns after bear markets have been relatively quick. That means that even if a recession ends in December of 2023, the market would recover a large percentage \u2013 about 91% \u2013  of its peak value before the year is over, they wrote.  Goldman analysts say that even with a sour economy, they predict the 2023 investment return on the S&P 500 will most likely be between 9-12%. That\u2019s a huge jump from last year\u2019s nearly 20% loss.  What the heck is going on with Bed Bath & Beyond stock Just last week, Bed Bath & Beyond warned that it was on the brink of bankruptcy \u2013 but you wouldn\u2019t know that by looking at the retailer\u2019s stock. Shares were up by about 50% in Thursday trading, and 238% so far this week. The company recently reported that it lost a third of its sales in last year\u2019s holiday run-up and that it would close more stores and lay off corporate employees in a bid to cut costs and stay afloat. The company\u2019s management also said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it was considering bankruptcy. Bankruptcy isn\u2019t a good thing for shareholders, who are typically the last to be paid out if a company goes out of business. In many cases, they don\u2019t get anything at all. But investors appear to be betting that the retailer will somehow avoid that fate, and their bets are catapulting the stock upwards. That speculation could also be triggering a short squeeze, which occurs when a stock moves higher and short sellers decide to cover their short positions or are forced to do so by margin calls. Bed Bath & Beyond has been heavily shorted, with many investors betting the stock will go down \u2013 it\u2019s currently the second-most shorted stock trading in the United States, behind Carvana. And as short sellers buy the stock, the price increases, creating even more of a squeeze. Fed Watch: The end of massive rate hikes? When Fed officials talk, investors tend to listen \u2013 and today they liked what they heard.  The Fed\u2019s days of three-quarter-point rate hikes are behind us, said Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker in a blog post Friday.  Better-than-expected price data shows that the Fed\u2019s aggressive and economically painful rate hikes are successfully slowing the economy and fighting inflation, he said. That likely means the Fed will slow the pace of those hikes. Going forward, said Harker, rate hikes of a quarter point will be appropriate.   \u201cLast year, we raised the target for the federal funds rate to between 4.25% and 4.5%,\u201d Harker wrote. \u201cThat was a significant move, and a very fast one, given that we started the year at about 0%. I expect that we will raise rates a few more times this year, though, to my mind, the days of us raising them 75 basis points at a time have surely passed. In my view, hikes of 25 basis points will be appropriate going forward.\u201d Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard, meanwhile, also said on Thursday that he doesn\u2019t think rate hikes should continue beyond 2023, though he added that he\u2019d like the option of raising rates by half a point on the table at the next policy meeting (Bullard is not a voting member this year). \u201cThe front-loading policy has served us well and would continue to serve us well, going forward. I don\u2019t really see any purpose in dragging things out through 2023,\u201d he said at a virtual event hosted by the Wisconsin Bankers Association.  Markets ended Thursday higher, with the Nasdaq notching its fifth consecutive win and its longest rally since July.  Traders now overwhelmingly expect a quarter-point rate hike in February, according to the CME FedWatch tool. ",

In March 2019, Chinese aviation authorities instructed airlines in the country to ground all their Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, citing the need for \u201cstrict control of safety risks.\u201d The decision followed two 737 Max 8 crashes in Ethiopia in 2019 and Indonesia in 2018. The Boeing 737 Max 8 that took off Friday is operated by China Southern Airlines and traveled from Guangzhou to Zhengzhou, according to  Flightradar24. The flight comes as the Chinese travel market is recovering after the country abandoned zero-Covid policies. In September, Boeing and its former CEO Dennis Muilenburg agreed to pay hefty fines to settle charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission alleging they misled the public about the safety of the 737 Max following the two fatal crashes. The SEC had alleged that, following an October 2018 crash of a Lion Air 737 Max jet that killed 189 people, Boeing and Muilenburg knew that part of the plane\u2019s flight control system posed an ongoing safety concern yet told the public that the 737 Max was safe to fly.

The company is considering opening its first plant in Europe and a second one in Japan, its CEO CC Wei said in an earnings call on Thursday. TSMC, which produces an estimated 90% of the world\u2019s super-advanced chips, has already upped its investment in the United States. The company announced last year that it\u2019s building a second semiconductor factory in Arizona and raising its investment there from $12 billion to $40 billion. Speaking about TSMC\u2019s new plans on Thursday, Wei said that in Europe \u201cwe\u2019re engaging with customers and partners to evaluate the possibility of building a specialty fab, focusing on automotive-specific technologies, based on the demand from customers and level of government support.\u201d  A fab refers to a semiconductor fabrication plant. The company is also considering building a second fab in Japan, \u201cas long as the demand from customers and the level of government support makes sense,\u201d he said. These plans come amidst falling demand for semiconductors because of a weakening global economy. \u201cIn the first half of 2023, we expect our revenue to decline [by] mid- to high single-digit percent over the same period last year in US dollar terms,\u201d Wei said, adding that he expects revenue to increase in the second half of the year. \u201cFor the full year of 2023, we forecast the semiconductor market, excluding memory, to decline approximately 4%,\u201d he added. TSMC is considered a national treasure in Taiwan and supplies tech giants including Apple and Qualcomm. It mass produces the most advanced semiconductors in the world, components that are vital to the smooth running of everything from smartphones to washing machines. The company is perceived as being so valuable to the global economy, as well as to China \u2014 which claims Taiwan as its own territory despite having never controlled it \u2014 that it is sometimes even referred to as forming part of a \u201csilicon shield\u201d against a potential military invasion by Beijing.  TSMC\u2019s presence gives a strong incentive to the West to defend Taiwan against any attempt by China to take it by force, analysts say. The company\u2019s international expansion has caused deep unease in Taiwan. Apart from the risk that TSMC will take its most advanced technology with it \u2014 stripping Taiwan of one of its unique assets and reducing employment opportunities locally \u2014 there are fears that a diminished presence for the company could expose Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital, to greater pressure from Beijing.",

The FAA also now says \u201cpersonnel who failed to follow procedures\u201d caused the computer system failure that triggered Wednesday\u2019s delay. The Notices to Air Missions (NOTAM) database failure triggered the FAA to implement the first nationwide stop of air traffic in more than 20 years. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has held multiple meetings with top FAA officials since Wednesday\u2019s meltdown and \u201chas made it very clear\u201d he wants the NOTAM database updated much faster than the FAA\u2019s planned timeline, the source tells CNN. \u201cThe core operating system for the database has been around since the 1990s,\u201d the source said. \u201cRegardless of the improvements made to the system in recent years, it still has the heart of an 89-year-old man.\u201d In its budget estimate for 2023, the FAA requested $29.4 million for its Aeronautical Information Management Program, which includes the NOTAM system. Describing the system, the administration said it needs to \u201celiminate the failing vintage hardware that currently supports that function in the national airspace system.\u201d Meanwhile, the FAA is stuck addressing new technology, including drones and electric helicopters, with its outdated technology, the source said. \u201cWe need to bring equipment online a lot faster than we are,\u201d the source said, noting a big investment is required because it\u2019s far more complicated than an over-the-air iOS update. \u201cIt\u2019s gone on for years.\u201d  CNN has reached out to the FAA for comment on updates to the NOTAM system to date and its modernization timeline. On Thursday, the FAA said the computer system failure that triggered the delay was caused by \u201cpersonnel who failed to follow procedures.\u201d The agency says it has conducted a \u201cpreliminary analysis\u201d into the failure of the NOTAM database.  \u201cThe agency determined that a data file was damaged by personnel who failed to follow procedures,\u201d says a late Thursday statement from the FAA that also noted operations had returned to normal. \u201cThe system was functioning properly and cancellations today were below one percent.\u201d  Earlier, CNN first reported that the computer system that failed was 30 years old and was at least six years away from a planned update, according to a government source.  The failure is expected to be a main sticking point as the FAA enters its federal funding reauthorization process \u2014 especially with the GOP now in control of the House. The FAA is already taking criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Airlines, fielding their own share of government criticism for schedule collapses, have also sounded the alarm about a lack of funding, limited staffing, and outdated FAA technology.  During a September US Chamber of Commerce event, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby told CNN\u2019s Pete Muntean that the aviation industry should rally around the FAA following a summer marred by flight cancelations and delays.  \u201cThe FAA needs more funding,\u201d Kirby said in an on-stage interview before aviation leaders. \u201cThey need more investment for technology.\u201d",

            "text": "The airline industry slowly resumed service after a Federal Aviation Administration system outage caused thousands of flight delays and cancellations across the United States Wednesday. The FAA briefly halted all domestic flight departures across the US Wednesday morning, lifting the ground stop around 9 a.m. ET after it restored a system that provides pilots with pre-flight safety notices.  But airlines continued to delay or cancel flights because of ongoing congestion.  By late Wednesday afternoon, the FAA\u2019s website was still showing ground delays at some airports. Major US carriers including United Airlines, Delta and American Airlines all said they had grounded flights in response to the situation. United and Delta have issued travel waivers in response to the outage. American Airlines said its customers could rebook their flights Wednesday and Thursday without additional fees. FlightAware, which tracks delays and cancellations, showed more than 9,500 flights to, from and within the United States as being delayed as of 6 p.m. ET, and more than 1,300 flights canceled. Southwest, which canceled thousands of flights after Christmas following a systemwide meltdown, was hit hard, with more than 400 canceled flights. About 10% of Southwest\u2019s Wednesday flights had been canceled and about half delayed as of 6 p.m. ET. Southwest operations had resumed by mid-morning, the airline said.  \u201cAs a result of the FAA\u2019s outage, we anticipate some schedule adjustments will be made throughout the day,\u201d Southwest said in a statement, encouraging travelers to check their flight status online or via the airline\u2019s app. Southwest has also issued a waiver allowing travelers to change their flights. American Airlines was also hit hard: Including feeder airlines that use regional jets, American said it had canceled nearly 400 flights as of midday Wednesday.  Cause of outage under investigation The affected system, Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM), sends alerts to pilots to let them know of conditions that could affect the safety of their flights. It is separate from the air traffic control system that keeps planes a safe distance from each other, but it\u2019s another critical tool for air safety. In a statement Wednesday night, the FAA acknowledged that a corrupted file had led to the outage, confirming CNN\u2019s reporting. \u201cOur preliminary work has traced the outage to a damaged database file. At this time, there is no evidence of a cyberattack,\u201d the FAA said. That echoed what Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan in an interview Wednesday.   \u201cThere\u2019s been no direct evidence or indication of [a cyberattack] but we are also not going rule that out until we have a clear and better understanding of what\u2019s taken place,\u201d Buttigieg said.    The 90-minute ground stop of flights across the United States Wednesday morning was implemented out of an \u201cabundance of caution.\u201d Buttigieg said that there were \u201cirregularities\u201d overnight in the safety messages that were going out to pilots that reflected a larger issue.  Buttigieg, who has been hard on airlines over their staffing and technology issues in the last year, said the Transportation Department and Federal Aviation Administration would \u201cown\u201d responsibility for their failures.     \u201cNo, these kinds of disruptions should not happen and my primary interest now that we\u2019ve gotten through the immediate disruptions of the morning is understanding exactly how this was possible and exactly what steps are needed to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d Buttigieg said.    Buttigieg said via Twitter Wednesday morning that he had ordered an \u201cafter-action process to determine root causes and recommend next steps.\u201d Nav Canada also reported an outage of Canada\u2019s NOTAM system on Wednesday. That nearly three-hour outage did not impact flight operations and its cause is under investigation, the air navigation service provider said. \u201cAt this time, we do not believe the cause is related to the FAA outage experienced earlier today,\u201d Nav Canada said in a statement.  Another aviation meltdown It\u2019s the second time in less than a month that frequent flyer Erin Potrzebowski has had her Southwest flight canceled as part of mass flight cancellations.  \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything like the event today and like the Southwest event from a couple of weeks ago,\u201d said Potrzebowski, who was waiting for a rescheduled flight to New Orleans at Chicago Midway International Airport on Wednesday.  \u201cIt\u2019s common to experience weather-related issues but I\u2019ve never experienced mass cancellations that impact the entire country,\u201d Potrzebowski said. Calls came swiftly for aviation system upgrades. \u201cToday\u2019s FAA catastrophic system failure is a clear sign that America\u2019s transportation network desperately needs significant upgrades,\u201d said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.  \u201cAmericans deserve an end-to-end travel experience that is seamless and secure. And our nation\u2019s economy depends on a best-in-class air travel system.\u201d The Federal Aviation Administration is currently without a permanent leader, and President Biden\u2019s nominee for the role has faced criticism. Investment in the agency is set to be addressed this year by Congress when the five-year FAA Reauthorization Act signed in 2018 expires.   International impacts International flights bound for the United States were continuing to take off from Amsterdam and Paris Wednesday despite the situation. A Schiphol Airport spokesperson told CNN that \u201ca workaround had been issued\u201d and flights were still departing from Amsterdam. Paris\u2019 Charles de Gaulle airport was not seeing cancellations, but delays were expected, according to the airport\u2019s press office. Frankfurt Airport also told CNN it had not been impacted. A London Heathrow Airport spokesperson told CNN early Wednesday that they were \u201cnot aware of canceled flights and that flights to the US had left recently,\u201d however, there were passenger reports of significant delays. Shabnam Amini told CNN that she and other travelers had been sitting on board Americans Airlines flight 51 to Dallas for almost three hours at Heathrow because of the FAA outage.  She said they had been informed that there were delays but were still boarded onto the aircraft.   Commercial airline pilots use NOTAMS for real-time information on flight hazards and restrictions. The FAA stipulates NOTAMS are not to be relied on as a sole source of information, and so some flights may be able to satisfy safety requirements by using other data. Wednesday\u2019s incident comes on the heels of another aviation crisis. A huge winter storm over the end-of-year holidays caused extensive disruption and helped trigger the Southwest Airlines meltdown that affected thousands of passengers. While Wednesday\u2019s flight cancellations at Southwest are a problem for its customers, it was nowhere near as bad as what it experienced from December 21 through December 29, when about 16,000 flights, or nearly half of its schedule, had to be canceled due to lack of available staff.",

            "text": "The Walt Disney Company has named Nike executive chairman Mark Parker as its new board chair, replacing longtime director Susan Arnold, whose term limit is expiring. Parker, a Disney board member since 2016, takes over Disney\u2019s board at a time of transition for America\u2019s largest media company. Bob Iger recently returned as CEO after a brief hiatus.  \u201cMark Parker\u2019s vision, incredible depth of experience and wise counsel have been invaluable to Disney, and I look forward to continuing working with him in his new role, along with our other directors, as we chart the future course for this amazing company,\u201d said Iger in a statement.  In 2019, Parker stepped down as Nike\u2019s CEO after 13 years at the helm. Disney said among Parker\u2019s qualifications as board chair is that he navigated a successful CEO transition at Nike. Disney announced Wednesday the formation of a CEO succession committee to replace Iger, who said in November he would return as chief executive for only a two-year stint. \u201cIt is the top priority of mine and the Board\u2019s to identify and prepare a successful CEO successor, and that process has already begun,\u201d Parker said in a statement Wednesday. Iger\u2019s return shocked the media industry. Disney ousted Bob Chapek, who replaced Iger in 2020 as CEO.  Among the problems facing Disney: Its streaming business lost $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. And Disney\u2019s media networks are struggling as cord cutting accelerates and once lucrative outlets like ESPN lose viewership. Dan Loeb, the activist investor and Third Point CEO, made headlines in August when he suggested \u201ca strong case can be made that the ESPN business should be spun off to shareholders with an appropriate debt load.\u201d  Another activist shareholder group, Trian Partners, nominated its leader Nelson Peltz as a director. Disney said Wednesday it will work with Peltz but opposed his appointment to the board. \u201cMr. Iger\u2019s mandate is to use his two-year term and depth of experience in the industry to adapt the business model for the shifting media landscape, rebalancing investment with revenue opportunity while bringing a renewed focus on the creative talent that has made The Walt Disney Company the envy of the industry,\u201d the company said in its opposition of Peltz.  Arnold, the outgoing chairwoman, had served on Disney\u2019s board since 2007. She was announced as the board\u2019s leader on December 31, 2021.  She praised Parker for helping lead Disney through a difficult period for the company and the broader media industry. \u201cMark Parker is an incredibly well-respected leader who over seven years as a Disney director has helped the company effectively navigate through a time of unprecedented change,\u201d Arnold said in a statement. Iger praised Arnold for \u201csuperb leadership \u2026 and for her tireless work over the past 15 years as an exemplary steward of the Disney brand.\u201d",

            "text": "A critical Federal Aviation Administration computer system that experienced an outage Wednesday and briefly halted all US flights provides airlines with a digital bulletin board of crucial safety updates. The system is known as the Notice to Air Missions or NOTAM. It send alerts to pilots to let them know of conditions that could affect the safety of their flights. It is separate from the air traffic control system that keeps planes a safe distance from each other, but it\u2019s another critical tool for air safety. NOTAM messages could include information about lights being out on a certain runway, or a tower near an airport not having the required safety lights working, or an air show taking place in the air space nearby. \u201cIt\u2019s like telling a trucker that a road is closed up ahead. It\u2019s critical information,\u201d said Mike Boyd, aviation consultant at Boyd Group International. Boyd and others said Wednesday\u2019s problems are a sign that computer systems need to be upgraded. \u201cToday\u2019s FAA catastrophic system failure is a clear sign that America\u2019s transportation network desperately needs significant upgrades,\u201d said Geoff Freeman, CEO of the US Travel Association, a trade group for the travel and tourism industries. \u201cAmericans deserve an end-to-end travel experience that is seamless and secure. And our nation\u2019s economy depends on a best-in-class air travel system.\u201d Although many flights take place without needing to see one of those notices, it\u2019s important that NOTAM messages reach the pilots, who are trained to check for them. The FAA also operates the nation\u2019s air traffic control system, with air traffic controllers using radar to track all planes in their air space and radio communications with their cockpits to guide them safely. The computer systems that are the backbone of ATC system have also been known to go down. But when that happens, it typically only affects one region of country, not the entire nation\u2019s air space. NOTAM is a national system, so its failure Wednesday meant that flights across the country were ordered not to take off for a couple of hours before they were cleared to fly again shortly before 9 am ET.  If no new problems crop up, flights should return to normal soon, though it may take time to get all the delayed flights in the air. Just before noon ET Wednesday, tracking service FlightAware shows about 7,000 delayed flights to, from and within the United States, with nearly 1,100 canceled flights altogether. Aviation analytics firm Circium said 23,000 domestic and international flights to or from the United States were scheduled for Wednesday. \u201cBy 6 pm this evening we won\u2019t even know it happened, I think,\u201d said Boyd. But if the problem stretches too long, flight crews who are standing by to fly delayed flights will run out of time in their service day.  In that case, a delayed flight could turn into a canceled one if another fresh crew can\u2019t be found.  NOTAMS has been around for decades. But until December 2021, it was known by the name \u201cNotice to Airmen,\u201d although the acronym remains the same.  It was changed to remove the gendered term and because the notices were also then being sent to drone operators and not just pilots on board aircraft.",

The 55 passengers were still on a shuttle bus out to the plane, boarding passes in hand, when the Go First flight to New Delhi departed.  In a statement to CNN, Go First acknowledged the incident, which took place on January 9. \u201cWe sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to the passengers due to an inadvertent oversight in the reconciliation of flight G8 116, from Bengaluru to Delhi,\u201d said a spokesperson for the airline, which operates domestic flights in India. \u201cPassengers were accommodated on alternate airlines to Delhi and onward to other destinations.\u201d    One of the stranded passengers was Neeraj Bhat, who was returning home from a vacation in Bengaluru, which is also called Bangalore. Bhat tells CNN that his boarding group was on the last shuttle bus from the gate out to the plane when anxieties started to set in. The bus hadn\u2019t moved in about half an hour, and no announcements were made. \u201cOne of the passengers got a call from their friends who was already on the flight and asked why they weren\u2019t on the plane,\u201d he says. \u201cWe asked the bus driver, but he didn\u2019t have any information. That\u2019s when we realized there was some confusion.\u201d Bhat, who lives in New Delhi, was booked on a flight that took off four hours later and says he was not offered a meal voucher or other compensation while he waited.    The Directorate General of Civil Aviation, India\u2019s national aviation regulator, has confirmed it is investigating the incident, which it called a \u201cdereliction of their regulatory obligations,\u201d according to CNN affiliate News18. According to Go First\u2019s spokesperson, \u201call concerned staff\u201d have been taken off of the work rota, and the airline has issued a notice to Bengaluru airport\u2019s ground handling agency.  The airline also says it will give one free ticket on any domestic route to the passengers who were affected. Bhat, however, says he won\u2019t be taking Go First up on its offer.

            "text": "A rocket operated by a California-based start-up failed near the coast of Alaska Tuesday, marking yet another mishap for companies hoping to offer their services to launch scores of small satellites into orbit.  The privately held ABL Space Systems attempted to launch its RS1 rocket at 1:27 p.m. local time (5:27 p.m. ET) in Alaska. But the company confirmed shortly after that there was an \u201canomaly,\u201d an aerospace term for an issue or misstep, and the rocket \u201cshut down prematurely.\u201d \u201cThis is not the outcome we were hoping for today, but one that we prepared for. We\u2019ll revert with additional information when available,\u201d the company said in a tweet. \u201cThanks to all for the support.\u201d The mission was aiming to carry two small satellites to orbit for OmniTeq, which recently spun off its space division. The company signed an agreement for ABL\u2019s first launch in 2021 when it was still operating under the name L2 Aerospace. ABL\u2019s launch attempt on Tuesday was the second failure in two days for a burgeoning new industry: ABL is one among a long list of companies pursuing the same market \u2014 offering relatively cheap and easy access to launch services for operators of small satellites, which in years past have had to wait for extra room to open up aboard larger rockets. On Monday, Virgin Orbit, a direct competitor of ABL attempting to launch its first mission out of the United Kingdom, acknowledged that its air-launched rocket failed to reach orbit.  The core of the business model propped up by companies like ABL and Virgin Orbit is offering frequent rides to space and making the process more responsive to the needs of small satellite companies, including those that are essentially building massive constellations of satellites in low-Earth orbit for a variety of purposes, such as providing space-based internet or monitoring Earth\u2019s climate and resources.   These small spacecraft include SmallSats, which are as big as a family-size kitchen fridge, and a popular subset of SmallSats called CubeSats, which are standardized, miniature satellites that can be smaller than a shoebox. The start-ups build rockets that are much smaller than SpaceX\u2019s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, for example. But so far, the new class of smaller rockets have not proven to be as reliable as their larger counterparts. Nearly every start-up in the industry has suffered at least one launch failure. In a packed field, ABL was hoping to join a short list of US-based ventures that have notched at least one successful mission. The first, in 2018, was Rocket Lab, which so far has more than two dozen successful launches and three failures. Start-ups Astra and Firefly have also delivered satellites to orbit \u2014 as well as suffered setbacks. Those companies may soon be joined by yet another start-up, Relativity, which currently has its first rocket poised at a launch site in Florida. While all these rockets dedicated to launching small satellites are taking off, they do face competition from larger rockets that have started catering certain services to the same market. SpaceX, for example, started a SmallSat \u201crideshare\u201d business in 2019 with its hefty Falcon 9 rocket, and the company so far has launched six missions dedicated to small satellites for various customers.  The failed ABL launch Monday comes after the first few attempts to get its RS1 rocket off the ground in December came up short. The company worked through several technical problems, including a faulty sensor and a couple pressurization issues, to get the RS1 ready for Tuesday\u2019s flight attempt.",

            "text": "Galactic Energy, a rocket startup in China, launched five satellites into orbit on Monday, boosting the private company\u2019s ambition to become the Chinese rival to SpaceX. Galactic Energy\u2019s Ceres-1 rocket lifted off Monday from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China, sending five commercial satellites into their intended orbits, the Beijing-based company said in a statement on the same day.  The five satellites will be used for telecommunication, weather forecasts and scientific research for government agencies in the country, the company added. The mission marks the fifth launch of the Ceres-1 rocket \u2014 a small solid fuel orbital rocket designed by the company, Galactic Energy said. So far, it has successfully put 19 commercial satellites into space, setting a record for a private Chinese firm. \u201cIt sounds the trumpet for us to start a high-density orbital launch in 2023,\u201d it said, adding that it plans to complete 8 to 10 missions for this year.  Galactic Energy conducted the first Ceres-1 launch on November 7, 2020, which makes it the second Chinese private company to launch a satellite into low Earth orbit. A Beijing-based startup, i-Space, was the first to do so in 2019.   Many Chinese commercial satellite launch providers are currently using small solid-propellant rockets like Ceres. But some firms are developing or testing reusable liquid-propellant rocket engines, which allow precise control of the thrust after ignition.  Last year, Galactic Energy successfully tested its liquid-propellant Welkin engine for its next-generation rockets. Its founder Liu Baiqi said that they want to build the Chinese version of the Merlin engine, which was developed by SpaceX. Founded in 2018, Galactic Energy has received several rounds of financing from private equity investors and venture capitalists, worth more than $250 million in total. Major investors include the investment arm of Aviation Industry Corporation of China, a state-owned aerospace and defense conglomerate. China\u2019s commercial space industry has expanded rapidly since 2015, when the government began encouraging private companies to enter the space sector. Before that, launching rockets and satellites had been the monopoly of state-owned aerospace companies. Over the past few years, more than 170 private companies have entered the space industry, according to a 2020 research report by Future Space Research, a research institute based in Beijing.  The successful launch by the Chinese startup came on the same day that Virgin Orbit suffered failure on its first rocket launch from the United Kingdom.",

The first of the US-made planes are expected to enter the Royal Canadian Air Force in 2026 with the full fleet being operational by 2033 or 2034, a Canadian government news release said. With the deal, Canada becomes the last of the F-35 program\u2019s original eight partners to acquire the fifth-generation fighter, regarded as one of the best fighter jets in the world. \u201cIn today\u2019s complex global environment, Canada requires a military that is flexible, agile and capable of responding to a variety of unforeseen situations,\u201d Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand said in a statement. \u201cAs the rules-based international order is challenged around the world, the F-35 will be essential for protecting Canadians, enhancing Arctic security and national sovereignty, and enabling Canada to meet its NATO, NORAD and other obligations well into the future,\u201d the statement said. NORAD is a joint US-Canadian command that provides air and missile defense for North America. Manufacturer Lockheed Martin has seen a rush of interest in the F-35 over the past year, especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Germany, Switzerland and Finland made deals for the F-35 in 2022, while NATO allies Greece and the Czech Republic also announced requests to buy the stealth fighters. Besides the US Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, F-35s are also in or soon to be part of the fleets of Australia, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Japan, South Korea, Israel, Poland, Belgium and Singapore. The jets come in three versions, the standard F-35A, the short-take off and vertical landing F-35B, and the aircraft carrier version, the F-35C. Canada will buy the F-35A model to replace its aging CF-18s. \u201cCanada requires a fighter fleet to protect the sovereignty of one of the largest expanses of airspace in the world\u201d \u2013  the country\u2019s vast Arctic frontier \u2013 Anand said. To that end, the $14.2 billion (19 billion Canadian dollars) price tag includes construction at two air bases in Alberta and Quebec, and associated equipment and services, the government said. The announcement said the program is expected to generate 3,300 jobs annually over 25 years and contribute $310 million ($425 million Canadian) annually to the country\u2019s gross domestic product. As an original member of the F-35 program, Canadian industry has seen $2.8 billion in contracts to date related to the construction of the fighter jet, the government said.",

Hiring for roles in other areas will continue and the new analyst class will start later this year as planned, the person added. News of the layoffs was first reported by Bloomberg.  The bank declined to comment. Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) had 49,100 employees at the end of the third quarter. It added thousands of jobs to its headcount during the pandemic recovery as markets and investment banking boomed. But the mood on Wall Street has deteriorated since the Federal Reserve and other central banks started aggressively raising borrowing costs in a bid to rein in inflation. Companies are looking to conserve cash in case interest rate hikes trigger a global recession, and the appetite for mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings has dried up. That\u2019s hurt companies like Goldman Sachs that advise on these transactions. The bank\u2019s revenue during the third quarter of 2022 dropped 12% from a year ago. Investment banking revenue plunged 57% year-over-year. In October, the firm announced that it would streamline operations, combining its trading and investment banking divisions and folding its digital consumer bank Marcus into its wealth management business. Shares of Goldman Sachs were up less than 1% in premarket trading Monday. Last year, they fell about 10%, outperforming the broader S&P 500 index.  The layoffs come as blue-chip companies gear up for what\u2019s expected to be a tumultuous year. Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN) said earlier this month that it plans to lay off more than 18,000 employees. Other banks, including Morgan Stanley\n            \n                (MS), have also laid off staff as the business environment has soured. ",

            "text": "Chinese tech giants are witnessing a dream start to the year.  The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index \u2014 a popular index tracking Chinese firms listed in the United States \u2014 soared 13% in the first two trading days of 2023, marking its best start to a year on record, according to data compiled by Refinitiv dating back to 2003.  US-listed shares of Chinese e-commerce firms Alibaba\n            \n                (BABA), JD.com\n            \n                (JD) and Pinduoduo\n            \n                (PDD) added $53 billion to their combined market value on Wednesday. So far this week, their market cap has increased by nearly $70 billion.  In contrast, major US stock indexes were mostly flat in the past two sessions. The surge comes as investors are feeling optimistic that Chinese regulators will go easy on tech firms this year and also introduce measures to boost growth in the industry.   The Hong Kong-listed stock of Alibaba staged a sharp rebound as well. It\u2019s up 12% so far this year, rebounding nearly 70% from its record low in late October.   The change in sentiment comes after Jack Ma\u2019s Ant Group won a key approval for capital expansion of its consumer finance unit. Ant Group is a fintech affiliate of Alibaba, both of which were founded by Ma. \u201cApproval for Ant Group to expand its consumer finance business marked another positive step in easing regulatory risks,\u201d said Yeap Jun Rong, a market analyst at IG Group. Chinese tech companies have faced a sweeping regulatory crackdown since late 2020, which drove investors away. In 2021 and 2022, the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index plummeted 46% and 25% respectively. Ant\u2019s fundraising plan The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission has approved an application by Ant\u2019s consumer finance unit to expand its registered capital from $1.2 billion to $2.7 billion, according to a government notice issued late last week. After the fund raise, Ant will control half of its key consumer finance unit, while an entity controlled by the Hangzhou city government will own a 10% stake. Hangzhou is where Alibaba and Ant have been headquartered since their inceptions. The approval is a big step in Ant\u2019s restructuring, which is driven by regulators and has been going for more than two years. It also marks a crucial step in its longtime plan to go public.  In November 2020, regulators abruptly pulled the plug on Ant\u2019s $37 billion IPO, which was touted as the largest in history. A month later, they ordered Ant to overhaul its business. The latest approval of Ant\u2019s capital expansion plans has fueled hopes that Chinese authorities want to improve ties with the private sector, as they turn their focus to economic growth this year. Last month, Chinese leaders pledged at a key meeting that they would focus on boosting growth in 2023, after the zero-Covid policy battered the economy and sparked public discontent last year.  \u201cSofter calls for regulatory reforms and greater emphasis on economic growth\u201d have been in focus over the past months, said Yeap.",

            "text": "Some people say flying just isn\u2019t glamorous enough. And as airlines battle to cast themselves as the sleekest team in the skies, another brand has heard that complaint. British Airways has unveiled a new uniform \u2013 its first in nearly two decades. The airline\u2019s current threads, designed by Julien MacDonald, will be replaced by a line created by Ozwald Boateng, the Savile Row designer and tailor.  Engineers and ground operations staff will get their new uniforms in Spring 2023, while onboard crew and check-in agents will receive theirs in the summer.  And to keep things relatively green \u2013 at least, for an airline \u2013 staff will hand in their old uniform for recycling or charity donation when they pick up the new. Around 90% of the material is a fabric mix using recycled polyester. The path to new uniforms has been a lengthy one, starting in 2018 and involving over 1,500 staff, who took part in design workshops and garment trials.  Boateng shadowed staff to get an idea of their movements and requirements before designing the line, while for the past six months, crew have worn the uniform in \u201csecret trials\u201d on cargo flights, while maintenance staff have worn them out of sight at the UK\u2019s Manchester and Cotswold Airports, according to a press release.  Those trials have actually produced changes, too \u2013 engineers requested (and got) easy-access tool pockets, while ground handlers asked for gloves with fabric that would enable them to use their devices while wearing them. Crew had their apron pockets widened after reporting in trials that they needed more space during meal service.   As for the uniforms themselves, the airline says the Boateng has created \u201cbespoke fabrics and designs.\u201d An \u201cairwave\u201d pattern, inspired by air flowing across an airplane wing, features on jackets, t-shirts, buttons and ties, while a jacquard fabric used for tailored items incorporates the \u201cspeedmarque\u201d \u2013 BA\u2019s logo-like \u2018swish\u2019 painted on planes.   The collection has a tailored three-piece suit for men, who can choose between regular or slim fit pants. Women can choose between pants, skirt, dress or \u2013 a first for an airline \u2013 a jumpsuit. There is also a tunic and hijab option. Of course, the uniforms aren\u2019t quite up to Savile Row specifications \u2013 they are \u201chigh-quality, resilient fabrics that are easy to care for.\u201d The outdoor uniforms have even been put into freezers and into the shower to test their fit for extreme weather. Boateng said in a statement: \u201cDesigning this uniform was a vast and painstaking undertaking and it went far beyond clothes. It was about creating an energetic shift internally.    \u201cOne of my main objectives was to create something that spoke to, and for, the airline\u2019s colleagues. Something that inspired and empowered them, encouraged them to conduct their roles with pride and most importantly to ensure that they felt seen and heard. Although the airline has a strong heritage, it was imperative to support in creating a fresh narrative of change and transcendence, while remaining timeliness.\u201d Let\u2019s hope that works for the beleaguered airline. BA has yet to fully recover from the pandemic, during which it laid of swathes of staff. 2022 saw multiple IT meltdowns, baggage delays and canceled flights for the airline, which was at the heart of the UK\u2019s travel chaos in summer 2022.",

            "title": "Ram unveils electric pickup truck concept with three rows of seats",
            "text": "Stellantis\u2019s Ram truck brand is behind its competitors on launching an electric pickup, with trucks from major rivals already on the market or coming soon.  But Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said the company is using its time to come up with features and capabilities competitors won\u2019t have. That may include an extra row of removable fold-away seats.  The Ram 1500 Revolution concept truck, unveiled Thursday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, provides an early look at several features Ram\u2019s future electric truck could have, including a rear passenger cabin wall that folds away, leaving the truck cab fully open into the cargo bed. That is not a new idea, as General Motors\u2019 Chevrolet and GMC electric trucks hitting the market later this year and early next will offer a folding back cab wall; the Chevrolet Avalanche gas-powered truck also offered it over a decade ago.  What the Revolution concept also has, though, are \u201cthird row jump seats\u201d that fold out from that back wall while the second row of seats can slide forward to make room. Having three rows of seats is possible because, without the need for a gas engine, the Revolution\u2019s cab is extra-long. The seats can also be removed, said Ralph Gilles, Stellantis\u2019s head of design, allowing them to be used outside the truck or in the cargo bed for tailgating. Space under the hood is available for storage and there\u2019s a pass-through hole that can be opened through the cab and into the \u201cfrunk,\u201d or front trunk. Thanks to that pass-through and the fold-down cab wall, a pole or board as long as 18 feet can be loaded into the truck.  Stellantis promises that the production version of the truck, due out in 2024, will lead the market in terms of range, towing capability, payload capacity and charging speed. While not making any specific claims for this concept truck in terms of driving range or performance, Stellantis did say the truck would be capable of charging 100 miles of range in 10 minutes. That\u2019s fairly standard for vehicles that can work with fast chargers, but real-world charging times vary greatly depending on factors like outside temperature and the capabilities of the charger. Since it\u2019s a concept vehicle, it\u2019s likely that not all the features displayed on this truck will be included in the production version. The concept truck has doors that open outward from the center with no pillar in the middle. While that\u2019s a common design feature on concept vehicles \u2013 it makes the interior easier to see \u2013 it\u2019s almost never used in production vehicles that need the structural strength provided by that pillar. The Ram 1500 Revolution concept has two electric motors, one powering the back wheels and one for the front, giving it all-wheel-drive. It\u2019s the most common way of providing all-wheel-drive in electric vehicles but some trucks, like the Rivian R1T, use four motors, one powering each wheel. The Ram Revolution is engineered with room for bigger, more powerful motors for high performance versions of the truck, according to Stellantis. Some automakers already have electric trucks on the market, such as the Rivian R1T and Ford F-150 Lightning; others like General Motors have revealed production-ready trucks due to come to market by early 2024. Even Tesla is expected to finally start production of its Cybertruck by the end of 2023 following years of delays.  The electric Ram truck won\u2019t go on sale until some time in 2024. Stellantis promised that the production version of the Ram electric truck would be unveiled \u201cin the coming months.\u201d Once just a model of pickup truck produced under the Dodge brand, Ram was spun off as a separate brand in 2009. The truck line can trace its roots back to Graham Brothers Trucks, a company that began making trucks with Dodge engines and transmissions in 1921 and was later purchased by Dodge.",

He added that the airline invested more than $1 billion in Wi-Fi technology over the past few years.  Passengers will need to be a member of its free SkyMiles loyalty program to access the on-board internet. Customers who aren\u2019t members will have to pay a flat fee of $10.  More than 500 of Delta\u2019s domestic narrow-body planes serving the airline\u2019s \u201cmost popular routes\u201d will be ready for free Wi-Fi at launch, the company said. Wide-body international and smaller regional jets will be coming online by the end of 2024.  Customers will know if their flight has free Wi-Fi by a decal noting it near the boarding door. They also can connect multiple devices at one time.  The announcement, made Thursday at the Consumer Electronics Show, is several years in the making. Bastian said in 2018 that offering free Wi-Fi across its fleet was a priority, but needed time to improve the technology so passengers wouldn\u2019t have to struggle with sluggish speeds. Delta currently charges nearly $50 per month for Wi-Fi on its flights within North America and $70 on international flights. It has been testing free Wi-Fi over the past several years, and made messaging free in 2017. In-flight internet on any airline has been long plagued by complaints for its inconsistent speeds. However, efforts by a host of satellite providers and airlines have helped the technology evolve significantly in the past decade \u2014 though it still has some catching up to do to compare to home and office networks. Delta is the first of the \u201cBig Three\u201d airlines to offer free Wi-Fi: United Airlines and American Airlines\n            \n                (AAL) both charge varying rates for access. JetBlue\n            \n                (JBLU) has offered free Wi-Fi since 2017. The airline is beting that adding free W-Fi could make passengers more loyal to Delta and further grow its loyalty program, which has about 100 million members. In October 2022, Delta partnered with Starbucks\n            \n                (SBUX) and began awarding 1 mile for every $1 spent at the coffee chain.  Bastian predicted that partnership would add 1 million SkyMiles members within a year. However, Delta ended up adding 1 million new members within two weeks of its launch.",

Welcome to 2023, where an airline actually being punctual is headline news. The airline in question is South American carrier Azul Brazilian Airlines, which last year had the best on-time performance globally, according to a new report by aviation analytics firm Cirium. During what was a particularly chaotic 12 months for aviation, Azul Brazilian operated nearly 280,000 flights last year and 88.93% of them arrived within 15 minutes of its scheduled time at the gate \u2013 Cirium\u2019s performance measure.  Elsewhere in South America, Chile\u2019s LATAM Airlines (86.31% punctuality across more than 450,000 flights) took fourth place on Cirium\u2019s ranking of international airlines and Colombia\u2019s Avianca (83.48% and nearly 145,000 flights) was sixth.  America leads the way for airports The United States was also well represented, both for airlines and airports. For the second year in a row, Delta Airlines was given the Cirium Platinum Award for global operational excellence, which weighs up punctuality alongside operational complexity and an airline\u2019s ability to limit the impact of flight disruption to its passengers.  While Delta only made fifth place on the global leaderboard, an impressive 83.63% of its million-plus flights were on time.  United Airlines (80.46%) was in eighth place and American Airlines (78.29%) at No.10, while Southwest lagged behind with 74.06%.  Six out of the world\u2019s top ten most punctual airports were in the US, with Salt Lake City International Airport placing highest. Cirium reports that 83.87% of its 226,545 flights took off within 15 minutes of their scheduled departure time.   Bad year for Britain Asia-Pacific was considerably slower to open up air travel post-Covid compared to the rest of the world. Japan reopened its international borders in October and two of its airlines \u2013 All Nippon Airways (88.61%) and Japan Airlines 88.00% \u2013 were No.2 and No.3 on Cirium\u2019s leaderboard.  Japan\u2019s StarFlyer was named the world\u2019s leading low-cost carrier (95.23% punctuality across nearly 22,000 flights) and Tokyo\u2019s Haneda the top airport performer globally for on-time departures (90.33% punctuality across more than 370,000 flights).  It was a big year for travel to the Middle East, with the delayed Expo 2020 Dubai and FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 both taking place, but Emirates (at No.7) and Qatar Airways (at No.10) rose to the challenge well.  No European airlines or airports appeared in Cirium\u2019s top 10s of global leaders and no UK airline or airport even made the grade for its regional ranking of the best performers in Europe.  Spain\u2019s Iberia, with 85.87% punctuality across more than 91,000 flights, was named top in Europe.  The best global airlines for on-time performance, according to Cirium:  1. Azul Brazilian Airlines (88.93% punctuality; 279,722 flights).  2. All Nippon Airlines (88.61% punctuality; 162,370 flights).  3. Japan Airlines (88.00% punctuality; 165,981 flights).  4. LATAM Airlines (86.31% punctuality; 451,651 flights).  5. Delta Air Lines (83.63% punctuality; 1,004,684 flights).  6. Avianca S.A. (83.48% punctuality; 144,525 flights).  7. Emirates (81.30% punctuality; 137,589 flights).  8. United Airlines (80.46% punctuality; 789,200 flights).  9. Qatar Airways (78.32% punctuality; 152,377 flights).  10. American Airlines (78.29% punctuality; 1,076,100 flights).  The top-performing global airports of 2022 were: 1. Haneda Airport, Tokyo (90.33% punctuality; 373,264 flights).  2. Kempegowda International Airport, Bangalore, India (84.08% punctuality; 201,897 flights).  3. Salt Lake City International Airport, Utah (83.87% punctuality; 226,545 flights).  4.

The year ahead looks more promising, though uncertainty is still massive.  IATA, the trade association for most airlines worldwide expects airlines to return to profitability in 2023 after a loss making 2022, mostly the result of a Covid-19 shutdown hangover, but also the rise in fuel prices.  And long-awaited new airplanes could also be taking to the skies, helping usher in the next era of commercial aviation.  Risks remain though. Wars, global and regional recessions, Covid resurgence, changed travel patterns, the climate crisis, and many other factors are outside aviation\u2019s control. Here\u2019s what all of that means for travelers in 2023. Remapping the sky Covid-19 has marked the last three years of all our lives, and will continue to do so \u2013 but, in most cases, that won\u2019t include travel restrictions.  When Japan opened its doors to overseas travelers in fall 2022, it was the last major non-Chinese economy to do so.  In most ways that matter to airlines and their passengers, the world is now open. The big question almost everywhere \u2013 when China\u2019s quarantine and other travel restrictions will end \u2013 has finally been answered. The country announced an easing of travel restrictions from January 8. Another big question is Russia. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Russian airlines were banned from many countries\u2019 airspace, including the EU, US, and Canada, and vice versa.  Outside of the conflict zone, the biggest effect of this has been to flights between Europe and east Asia, which must either fly south of the conflict zone and over the Caucasus or north over Alaska. As a result, many European and Asian airlines cut their services. What this means is that there are fewer flights between Europe and Asia, and quite a lot of European and Asian airlines with aircraft that they were planning to use on those routes, and they\u2019re now looking to see where else they might fly them.  New routes between North America and Europe are already taking flight, with the big three transatlantic joint venture airline cartels \u2013 corresponding roughly to the Oneworld, Star Alliance and SkyTeam alliances, and which have been allowed to coordinate pricing between their members \u2013 adding many new routes and beefing up existing services. So if you see a new nonstop flight open up, it could be worth jumping on the opportunity. If European airlines regain access to Russian airspace and demand to and from China returns, the new nonstops might go back to requiring a layover.  While we\u2019re talking alliances, Virgin Atlantic is expected to join its part-owner Delta in the SkyTeam alliance early in 2023, while the longtime rumor that China Southern (by some counts the world\u2019s largest airline) will join the Oneworld alliance seems to be gaining some traction recently. That will open up some new connections for those airlines\u2019 partners \u2013 and their passengers. One new plane, but many new cabins The COMAC C919, China\u2019s first modern narrowbody airliner is expected to enter passenger service as 2022 ticks over into 2023. The new plane, seen as a major challenge to Western manufacturers, will give passengers in China a new option, although it\u2019s not much different from the experience on a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320. There are no other new planes on the horizon for 2023. Boeing\u2019s much-delayed 777X stretched widebody isn\u2019t expected to start delivery until 2025 at the earliest, and that\u2019s before test flights were suspended in early December owing to a problem with its General Electric GE9X engines.  There will be more deliveries of the current generation of planes, including the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787, which means more newer jets to fly on, but also some older planes being kept in the fleet longer.  On the Airbus side, the extra-long-range A321XLR narrowbody is planned to arrive with airlines in early 2024, although the good news for Airbus is that the US Federal Aviation Administration approved on December 8 the design of its extra fuel tank. That means those new nonstop flights between smaller airports, notably transatlantic routes, will be announced in 2023 \u2013 it\u2019s worth keeping an eye out and booking fast. We may see new aircraft variants announced. Airbus has been making positive noises about the much-rumored stretch of its small narrowbody A220 jet airliner, popular with passengers thanks to its wide seats, big bins and large windows.  As new planes arrive from the factory, they bring new cabins, like Airbus\u2019 more spacious Airspace cabin with its bigger bins and streamlined aesthetic.  \u201cThe rising number of Airspace cabin equipped aircraft entering the market means more and more passengers will benefit from comfort features as well as connectivity,\u201d Airbus\u2019 vice president of cabin marketing, Ingo Wuggetzer, tells CNN. \u201cThis is key for me in 2023 \u2013 it is about bringing these innovations to a growing number of passengers worldwide.\u201d Also, he expects, \u201cwe\u2019ll see a digitalization wave into the daily business of airlines.\u201d Digitalization is helpful for passengers: a more connected airline offers more information and more self-service options, helping to avoid airport lines or long waits on the phone. Comeback trails The huge (and hugely popular) Airbus A380 superjumbo is coming back into service. Abu Dhabi-based Etihad is the latest airline to bring its A380s back, which means more wider seats in economy on this big, quiet plane. It\u2019s great news for passengers. Two variants of Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX airplane, the shorter MAX 7 and the double-stretched MAX 10, are currently in certification limbo with an end-of-year deadline looming.  To sum up a complicated situation, US regulators want Boeing to install additional safety systems. That will be expensive for Boeing, not least because it contractually promised some airlines that it wouldn\u2019t need to do so in order to avoid them having to spend time and money training pilots on the differences.  This won\u2019t likely have any short term impact on passengers, but airlines\u2019 longer term plans to use these planes to replace older ones and to start new routes may be delayed. Security and sustainability At the airport, 2023 will be the year that some airports get rid of the \u201cliquid ban,\u201d where anything on the liquid-paste-cream-gel spectrum can only be carried in 3 ounce or 100 milliliter containers within a small zip-lock plastic bag.  Fliers may already have experienced early versions of the scanners that allow you to leave your liquid bag and electronics in your hand luggage, but these are rolling out more widely. The UK is expected to introduce these out across airports in 2023. Keep an eye out, too, for more sustainability claims around flights, as the climate crisis grows in importance.  One side of that is the growth in more sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) made from a variety of sources: waste oils, vegetable oils, algae, and so on. Virgin Atlantic recently announced it was trialing the first transatlantic carbon \u201cnet-zero\u201d flight powered by SAF in 2023, following similar projects by other airlines. Another side is making the insides of cabins, which are largely metals, plastics and fabrics, more sustainable. We talked to cabin designer Martin Darbyshire from tangerine, the design agency responsible for many of the most innovative cabins in recent times, who highlights that, \u201cas designers we have a responsibility to remove complexity, weight and cost, and deliver longer lasting and more repairable, and recyclable solutions for the airline interiors industry. Our clients are demanding it and we owe it to society to make it happen.\u201d Indeed, he says, it is \u201castonishing that it has taken all this time to gather momentum. Without a shadow of a doubt 2023 onwards will be dominated by environmental, social and corporate governance.\u201d Top image: China\u2019s new COMAC C919 passenger airplane.

            "text": "The Chinese navy\u2019s massive new aircraft carrier, the CNS Fujian, is expected to head to sea for the first time this year, the ship\u2019s executive officer said in an interview with state media. In a report on the interview published Tuesday by state-run China Daily, Senior Capt. Qian Shumin did not give an exact date for when the aircraft carrier will undergo its first sea excursions, saying only that \u201cthe trials will contribute to the realization of the centenary goals of the People\u2019s Liberation Army.\u201d That centenary, which comes in 2027, was referenced by Chinese leader Xi Jinping in October as a deadline for the PLA to meet its modernization goals. The Fujian is the largest warship China has ever built and bringing it into operation is a key component in the PLA Navy\u2019s objectives. The ship was launched with great fanfare on June 17 and has been in the final stages of construction at a Shanghai shipyard. Hawaii-based analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain, said he expects the Fujian\u2019s first trials to come in the spring. \u201cBased on the technologies and systems installed on the Fujian, the first sea trials will be conducted on/about March 2023 and consist of basic engineering and ship\u2019s maneuvering tests,\u201d said Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center. He said the initial trials would likely last three to seven days. They would be the first steps in an approximately 18-month-long series of trials that could see the Fujian become operational by October 2024, Schuster said. \u201cEach trial will be followed by an examination of what went right and wrong; and solutions to those problems, whether human or equipment-related, are identified and applied, respectively,\u201d he said. Displacing around 80,000 metric tons of water, according to the China Daily report, the Fujian is 50% larger than China\u2019s two current in-service carriers and puts the PLA Navy in the league of supercarriers, like the 100,000-ton US Nimitz-class ships. It also shows China matching US carrier technology. China\u2019s other two carriers, the Liaoning and the Shandong, are based on outdated Soviet technology. Those two carriers used the ski-jump launching system, in which where planes simply take off from a slight ramp, while US carriers use a more advanced catapult system to launch their aircraft. And the Fujian uses an electomagnetic catapult system, something the US has only on its newest operational carrier, the USS Gerald Ford. Schuster says integrating the Fujian\u2019s air wing into its operations using that new technology will be the final key part of its trials, and he expected that to come sometime in the summer of 2024.",

            "text": "Ask Southwest Airlines employees about their company\u2019s technology, and one word keeps coming up: \u201cantiquated.\u201d    While Southwest grew from a scrappy, Texas-based discount airline operating three planes into one of the nation\u2019s largest \u2013 union officials representing Southwest workers say the company did not keep pace with technology changes.  And they say they\u2019ve been raising concerns for years.    \u201cWe\u2019ve been harping on them since 2015-ish every year,\u201d Mike Santoro, a captain and vice president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, told CNN.    The result: A massive Christmas travel meltdown that scuttled holiday plans for hundreds of thousands of passengers. Nearly 16,000 flights canceled. Orphaned baggage piling up at airports and travelers told to give a shipping address.    Southwest is digging itself out of the mess and announced plans to \u201creturn to normal operations with minimal disruptions on Friday.\u201d   Leaders of multiple labor unions also told CNN that management briefed them about a more normal flight schedule heading into the holiday weekend.    But as extreme winter conditions swept much of the country last week \u2013 including important airports in Southwest\u2019s network \u2013 the airline\u2019s plan for \u201cirregular operations\u201d passed the breaking point, according to multiple people familiar with the situation.   They and the airline itself described an internal process that requires multiple departments to manually redesign the airline\u2019s schedule \u2013 a system that works \u201cthe vast majority of the time,\u201d Southwest said in a statement. Manual labor   \u201cThe magnitude and scale of this disruption stressed our technology and processes, forcing a great deal of manual processing,\u201d Southwest said. \u201cOur crews are showing up in every way throughout this challenge.\u201d    Other airlines managed to recover by early this week; at Southwest, the cancellations only increased.   While Southwest does have major connecting airports, much of its schedule involves planes and crews crisscrossing the country \u2013 a network that aviation watchers say is more vulnerable than legacy carriers\u2019 hub-and-spoke model that can contain a disruption to particular geographic regions.   When something goes wrong, the Southwest software \u2013 including the crew scheduling system tool \u2013 leaves much of the work of rebuilding that delicate network to be done manually.    \u201cIt can\u2019t see the best way to fix anything when flights are canceled,\u201d said Brian Brown, president of Transport Workers Union Local 550, representing Southwest dispatchers and meteorologists. \u201cIt requires a lot more human intervention and human eyesight or brainpower, and can only handle so much.\u201d    Where are the crews? The planes?  The result is that airline officials \u201cdon\u2019t necessarily know where our crews are, where our planes are,\u201d Brown said.   Crew schedulers in another department are manually checking which pilots and flight attendants meet strict federal rules on work hours \u2013 rules meant to keep inflight safety professionals from excessive fatigue.    \u201cYou end up with thousands of crew members having to call in and their wait times were hours just to talk to someone,\u201d Brown said. Software enhancements would make the process more efficient, he added.      The manual work meant crew members who could be working were instead stuck in lengthy phone queues waiting for instructions or for a hotel assignment to get their federally mandated rest.    \u201cThe phone systems that the company uses is just not working,\u201d Lyn Montgomery, who represents Southwest flight attendants at TWU Local 556, told CNN.  \u201cThey\u2019re just not manned with enough manpower in order to give the scheduling changes to flight attendants and that\u2019s created a ripple effect that is creating chaos throughout the nation.\u201d   Tech improvements have been spotty  Southwest has made some software improvements. Last year, the airline connected its reservation system with major booking software used by corporate travelers. The reservation system was overhauled in 2017 \u2013 a process overseen by current CEO Bob Jordan.   In recent years, the airline also introduced barcodes and scanners that replaced the pencil and paper method for counting checked baggage. But other tools remained rooted in 1990s technology, union officials said.    As the storm swept through, Southwest employees who load baggage, marshal planes into the gates, push back departing aircraft and remove ice from aircraft surfaces were racing to keep up in the frigid outdoor conditions.   \u201cWe\u2019ve had experienced people who were trying to de-ice aircraft, and they were literally not able to,\u201d said Randy Barnes, president of TWU 555. Some wind gusts were so dangerously strong that employees suspended from the air in bucket trucks were at risk of falling, and sprayed de-icing fluid was not reaching aircraft.    \u201cThey were trying to convey that to their local management team,\u201d Barnes told CNN. \u201cThey were saying you just can\u2019t do it \u2013 it does not work.\u201d    Brown said he and local union agents also advocated for special pay for employees working in these conditions and for opportunities to come inside for a break from the bitter cold. Video apology  Jordan, who took the reins earlier this year and began at Southwest as a programmer, apologized in a video message and pledged \u201cto double down on our already existing plans to upgrade systems for these extreme circumstances so that we never again face what\u2019s happening right now.\u201d    As the airline prepared to run a full schedule on Friday, Jordan wrote in an internal message to employees \u2013 that was obtained by CNN \u2013 that the airline is \u201cin good shape.\u201d    \u201cWe have all hands on deck and tested solutions in place to support the restored operation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m confident, but I\u2019m also cautious.\u201d  ",

            "text": "Tesla\u2019s stock is finishing out its tumultuous year with yet more turbulence: It\u2019s up almost 6% Thursday, but still down more than 10% since last week. And a new cut to its price target from Morgan Stanley isn\u2019t helping. Year-to-date, the stock is down about 70%. Morgan Stanley analysts on Thursday said that the company\u2019s sliding stock price represents a buying opportunity, but they cut its price target from $330 per share to $250. Tesla shares are trading at $122, with the stock up about 8% Thursday.  Morgan Stanley still believes the company is somewhat undervalued as a result of the big recent sell-offs, citing its head start over the electric car competition, and potential tax advantages as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act passed earlier this year. The losses, however, have further put a dent in the fortunes of one of the world\u2019s richest people. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, CEO Elon Musk is now worth $132 billion \u2014 less than half what he was worth at the beginning of the year. He lost the world\u2019s richest person title two weeks ago to Bernard Arnault, the chairman of French luxury goods giant LVMH\n            \n                (LVMHF).  Why Tesla is tanking A popular misconception has emerged about Elon Musk and Tesla: The megabillionaire\u2019s love affair with Twitter is the main reason Tesla shares have lost so much value this year.  Even as Musk signals he may give up his CEO title at Twitter, investors became concerned that the outlook for Tesla\u2019s sales and profit is taking a turn for the worse. A sign of the weakening demand: Tesla has announced a rare sale. The company offered two rebates for buyers who take delivery of a vehicle before the end of the year, initially offering a $3,750 discount earlier this month. Tesla then doubled that rebate to $7,500 last Thursday. \u201cTesla clearly is starting to see demand cracks in China and in the US at a time that EV competition is increasing across the board,\u201d said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and a Tesla bull who cut his price target for the stock last Friday from $250 to $175. \u201cThe price cuts that Tesla enacted was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back on the stock.\u201d Another reason Tesla\u2019s stock is sinking: The US economy could tip into recession next year, hurting car sales. Musk said on a Twitter Spaces call two weeks ago that he foresees the economy will be in a \u201cserious recession\u201d in 2023. \u201cI think there is going to be some macro drama that\u2019s higher than people currently think,\u201d he said, according to Reuters, adding that homes and cars will get \u201cdisproportionately impacted\u201d by economic conditions. Tesla\u2019s questionable valuation Part of the problem with Tesla\u2019s stock price is that critics question whether it was ever worth the trillion-dollar valuation it had at the start of the year. At its peak, Tesla was worth more than the 12 largest automakers on the planet combined, despite having a fraction of the sales of any of them. Today it is worth $399 billion. \u201cIt got ahead of itself in the near-term,\u201d said Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, another Tesla fan. \u201cI still believe this can be a much bigger company. I think it will see those kinds of numbers again. But it could take a long, long time to get there.\u201d Tesla\u2019s growth prospects - a target of 50% sales growth annually, helped drive that valuation. It conceded in October that it will miss that sales target for this year. The stock\u2019s climb to dizzying heights \u2013 rising 743% in 2020 alone \u2013 was driven by Musk\u2019s reputation as a genius who would disrupt the massive global auto industry. \u201cTesla was viewed as a disruptive technology company, not as an automaker, and a large part of that premium is related to Musk,\u201d said Ives. Overpromising and underdelivering Critics of Tesla said much of its sky-high valuation was based on promises that Musk made about future products, many of which came years after they were originally promised. A prime example is the Cybertruck, the Tesla pickup truck, first unveiled three years ago with promises that production would start in 2021.  Now production is slated to start next year, with a ramp-up in production in 2024, putting it years behind other electric pickup offerings from Ford and upstart EV maker Rivian, both of which have electric pickups available for purchase today. It could also trail planned electric pickup offerings from General Motors. \u201cElon Musk has a pathological problem with the truth,\u201d said Gordon Johnson, one of the largest critics of Tesla among analysts. \u201cWhen people say he\u2019s a genius and innovator, it\u2019s based on all his promises he never lives up to.\u201d Johnson said Tesla shares will have a much steeper fall ahead, once it starts being priced like other automakers rather than on its promises. He said that for Tesla to hit its growth targets it needs to be building new plants almost every year, but that new factories in Germany and Texas that opened in spring are still not operating at full capacity. And he said that its plant in China has had to scale back production due to weak sales in the market in the face of the Covid restrictions. \u201cDemand in the US has collapsed,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo months ago, your wait time was two or three months. Now you can get one immediately. They\u2019re going to build more cars than they sell for a third straight quarter. It\u2019s the definition of excess capacity.\u201d Tesla is still by far the largest EV maker worldwide, although that title is being challenged in some key markets, by Volkswagen in Europe and by BYD in China. And more competition is coming from established automakers such as Ford and GM. The Twitter factor That\u2019s not to say Twitter has played no role in Tesla\u2019s stock price demise this year: Tesla shares have lost over 65% of their value since Musk\u2019s interest in Twitter was first disclosed in April, with a nearly 50% decline since he closed on the deal in late October.  Investors have been disappointed that Musk appears to be paying for so much of his $44 billion purchase of Twitter by selling Tesla stock. Musk, Tesla\u2019s largest shareholder, has sold $23 billion worth of Tesla shares since his interest in Twitter became public in April. On a Twitter Spaces call last week call, Musk promised he was done selling shares of Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) stock until at least 2024, if not beyond. But he hasn\u2019t lived up to a previous promise in April that he was done selling Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) shares, selling $14.4 billion of that stock since that time. \u201cIt\u2019s been a Pinocchio situation for Musk saying he is done selling stock. Investors want to see him walk the walk and not just talk the talk,\u201d said Ives.",

            "text": "It\u2019s been another tough year for aviation, as the world returned to flying after the Covid-19 pandemic, only for the industry to be beset by chaos and cancellations. There were silver linings, however, as the industry slowly recovered and progress was made in terms of more environmentally sustainable flying. Here are the highs and lows of what\u2019s been a bumpy ride.  1. Covid restrictions eased and we (mostly) took off our masks We began the year with masks firmly on and Covid passes at the ready. The thaw began in March and April, with Europe leading the way on relaxing restrictions. Asia has been the slowest to reopen to tourism, but now even Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan are opening their doors. China, the last holdout, made a shock exit from its Zero Covid strategy this month, but experts warn the move may be too drastic.  2. We all started flying again \u2013 and that was a problem Delays, cancellations, long lines, strikes, fewer flights, higher fares. The summer of travel chaos matured into the winter of travel chaos as post-pandemic staffing shortages, infrastructure issues and in some quarters worker disputes, continued to cripple the industry. Flights and seats in the US and elsewhere are still not back to pre-pandemic levels, meaning high demand is still pushing up prices.  3. One of the world\u2019s busiest airports asked airlines to stop selling tickets Struggling to cope with the surge in demand, in July London Heathrow capped passenger traffic to 100,000 departures per day. During that month\u2019s mayhem dubbed \u201cairmageddon,\u201d Delta Air Lines dealt with the baggage handling crisis by flying a plane packed with 1,000 lost bags and zero passengers from Heathrow to its Detroit hub.   4. Some airlines tried to cut corners The cracks began to show. The CEO of European low-cost carrier Wizz Air attracted criticism for telling staff to take less time off for fatigue. And in the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration rejected regional airline Republic Airways\u2019 controversial proposal to reduce the hours it takes to become a co-pilot. 5. Passenger dissatisfaction shot up By August, airline passenger complains in the US were up 320% compared with pre-pandemic figures. And by November, US airlines had paid out more than $600 billion in refunds to travelers for canceled or changed flights since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Travelers with disabilities have been particularly hard hit by the gaps in service, with treatment often reaching \u201cunacceptable\u201d levels.  6. Flight attendants had enough of the bad behavior All the chaos and drama amounted to rising tensions in the sky and an increase in unruly passenger incidents. Flight attendants were on the front line of the \u201cunsustainable and shambolic\u201d situation. 7. Asia-Pacific lost its title as the world\u2019s biggest travel market  Before Covid changed the travel landscape, Asian Pacific air traffic accounted for more than a third of all global passenger journey by October 2022 aviation in the region remained down by 45%. In May, CNN reported how airline ticket scalpers had taken over the heavily restricted Chinese market.  8. Hong Kong flew dogs in private jets and gave away airline tickets for free In the locked-down world of January 2022, desperate pet owners in Hong Kong were resorting to chartering private planes for their dogs and cats when relocating out of the city. Having had some of the toughest travel restrictions in the world for more than two years, in October 2022, the newly relaxed Hong Kong confirmed plans to give away half a million airline tickets in a bid to boost tourism. 9. The invasion of Ukraine closed off airspace  The Russian invasion of Ukraine resulted in the closing of airspace over both countries and sanctions of Russian airlines (as well as retaliatory sanctions by Russia). The conflict also led to a spike in jet fuel prices in March. The world\u2019s largest commercial plane, the Antonov AN-225, was destroyed by Russian forces at its Ukraine base early in the war, but there are now plans to rebuild it.  10. It was another year of extreme weather  Experts believe that the climate crisis could mean the most severe and sudden type of turbulence, \u201cclear-air turbulence,\u201d will increase in coming decades. Recent serious turbulence incidents include dozens of people being injured on a Hawaiian Airlines flight on December and 18 and five people injured on a United Airlines flight the following day.  11. And heat waves have repercussions for air travel too  There were severe heat waves in Europe, the US and in Asia this summer and in one incident flights were suspended at a London airport after a runway was damaged by high temperatures. Extreme heat can also make it harder for planes to take off, particularly at airports at higher altitudes. Here\u2019s why.  12. The Airbus A380 made a comeback The Airbus A380, the world\u2019s largest passenger plane, is no longer in production but the superjumbo still made a comeback of sorts after being grounded during the height of the pandemic. Tim Clark, boss of Emirates \u2013 the A380\u2019s biggest customer \u2013 told CNN he wants Airbus to build another plane on the same mammoth scale. But will manufacturers or airlines bite?  13. The last ever Boeing 747 rolled off the production line More than 50 years after the launch of the superjumbo known as the \u201cqueen of the skies,\u201d the last ever Boeing 747 rolled off the production line in December 2023, ahead of being delivered to American cargo airline Atlas Air early next year. Boeing\u2019s new star airplane is the upcoming Boeing 777X, described as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest and most efficient twin-engine jet.\u201d  14. There were more ultra-long-haul record-breakers In March, Air New Zealand launched the first ever direct flights (clocking in at 17 hours) between Auckland and New York City. Soon after, Qantas launched a direct flight of a similar length between Melbourne and Dallas. And in May, Qantas ordered 12 A350-1000s which it hopes to use on its potentially record-breaking 20-hour Project Sunrise flights, which could connect Australia with New York and London.  15. Airlines planned ambitious transatlantic routes Newcomer FlyAtlantic is joining Norse Atlantic Airways in its mission to bring back budget transatlantic flights, despite it being a notoriously difficult market in which to turn a profit. And JetBlue has announced that it will expand its transatlantic low-fare offering in 2023, by introducing flights from New York and Boston to Paris, on top of its existing London service. 16. The much-heralded supersonic comeback rumbled on The race to be the successor to Concorde continued. In July, Bombardier\u2019s in-development Global 8000, the world\u2019s fastest passenger jet, went supersonic in tests. And in August, American Airlines agreed to purchase a fleet of 20 Mach 1.7 jets from Boom Supersonic \u2013 but the ambitious craft has yet to complete a test flight. And NASA continues work on its \u201cquiet\u201d supersonic plane, the X-59.  17. A few more sustainability milestones were reached In March, an Airbus A380 completed a flight powered by cooking oil and waste fats. This green alternative, known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), is the big hope for airlines hoping to curb carbon emissions, but it\u2019s still not widely used. Airbus is also now working on a hydrogen-powered fuel cell engine \u2013 which, again, will be tested on the mighty A380.  18. Experimental new aircraft were developed Solar Impulse 2, a solar-powered plane capable of staying in the air for months at a time, got a little closer to production after being bought by a US-Spanish start-up. A Spanish airline, Air Nostrum, also took a punt on less environmentally damaging aviation models by ordering a fleet of 10 hybrid airships. And in September, Alice, the first all-electric passenger airplane, made its debut flight in Washington.  19.  Some major airports got a makeover In the US, work progressed on the $8.5 billion revamp of Chicago O\u2019Hare, one of the world\u2019s busiest airports, and the much-maligned New York LaGuardia opened a fancy new $4 billion Delta Airlines terminal. In Singapore, new details were revealed for Changi Airport\u2019s Terminal 5. Changi has often been named \u201cthe world\u2019s best airport\u201d and now it\u2019s set to almost double in size.  20. There were cabin innovations, some more practical than others 21. An inexperienced passenger landed a plane by himself In April, CNN Travel was the first to try out a controversial new double-decker airplane seat prototype, which then went viral. In June, Air New Zealand announced its Skynest concept: full-length sleeping pods available to economy passengers, and in September, American Airlines revealed new premium suites with privacy doors.  In May, a passenger with no flying experience landed a single-engine Cessna 208 at a Florida airport after the pilot became incapacitated. And in July, a pilot was forced to land his small plane on a busy North Carolina highway after his engine failed three times. Think you could land a plane in an emergency? Here\u2019s what\u2019s involved.  22. Plane-spotting became the internet\u2019s new hobby In February, a UK plane-spotter named Jerry Dyer became a national hero as more than 200,000 people tuned in to watch bumpy aircraft landings on his YouTube live stream from Heathrow Airport during Storm Eunice. It was also a big year for flight-tracking service FlightRadar 24, which saw record numbers to its website during events such as Queen Elizabeth\u2019s coffin being transported by RAF jet. ",

            "text": "Investors saw a lot of red in 2022. But a company known for its magenta logo was a stock market darling this year.  Shares of T-Mobile\n            \n                (TMUS) rose about 20% in 2022, even as rivals AT&T\n            \n                (T) and Verizon\n            \n                (VZ) tumbled. Ma Bell was down about 2% while Verizon\n            \n                (VZ) plunged more than 25%.  T-Mobile is now worth about $175 billion as well, more than Verizon and AT&T, both of which are Dow components. T-Mobile\u2019s solid performance on Wall Street was one big reason why CEO Mike Sievert is the CNN Business pick for CEO of the Year.  Sievert beat out several other contenders, including Michele Buck at Hershey\n            \n                (HSY), Occidental Petroleum\u2019s\n            \n                (OXY) Vicki Hollub and Arvind Krishna of IBM\n            \n                (IBM). He joins 2021 CEO of the Year choice Albert Bourla of Pfizer\n            \n                (PFE) and previous winners Marc Benioff of Salesforce\n            \n                (CRM), Target\n            \n                (TGT) CEO Brian Cornell and Chipotle\u2019s\n            \n                (CMG) Brian Niccol. T-Mobile had an impressive year despite many economic challenges, including inflation. The company continued to gain market share at the expense of its rivals.  It also spent more money to blanket the country with increased 5G coverage and it has done some noteworthy partnerships, including one with Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, to try and gain more customers.  CNN Business spoke to Sievert about how T-Mobile has continued to perform well in a super competitive business. Sievert said the company is aware that \u201cconsumers are fearing inflation.\u201d That\u2019s why T-Mobile is trying to keep prices down, even as competitors have raised the cost of many of their plans because inflation hurt their profitability.  T-Mobile is even continuing to cover the cost of Netflix\n            \n                (NFLX) subscriptions for its subscribers following price hikes by the streaming media giant. \u201cIt\u2019s just another example of us making a big investment in customers, changing the industry in their favor, putting them first, and making an investment in them,\u201d Sievert said. The strategy is working. T-Mobile, thanks to its merger with Sprint in 2020, is now the second-largest wireless carrier in the US, ahead of AT&T and trailing only Verizon.  The company has about 112 million customers and has been adding subscribers at a faster clip than both of its main rivals. A 2021 data breach, which T-Mobile paid $350 million for this year to settle class-action suits, hasn\u2019t dented growth either.  Is wireless recession-proof? But there are some concerns. Sievert said inflation is among them, mainly for its employees. He explained that the company has boosted worker pay to account for rising prices. That has led to higher expenses, but Sievert said T-Mobile is less worried about inflation than other consumer firms. \u201cWe\u2019re somewhat insulated from inflation,\u201d he said, adding that T-Mobile\u2019s average revenue per customer has increased this year, not because of price increases but due to the fact that one of the company\u2019s more popular plans is a higher-priced service that offers more features.   Growing recession worries are an issue too, even though Sievert said \u201cwe don\u2019t see it as a foregone conclusion that a recession is coming. But we are prepared if it is.\u201d Sievert noted that wireless customers are probably going to be very reluctant to cut back on using their phones though, even if the economy heads south. That could make any downturn next year less of a problem than the 2008-2009 Great Recession was for cell phone companies. \u201cWe are in a category that people will retain. This is very different than 2008 before the smartphone revolution. People will hold on to wireless,\u201d he said. Cell phone service from the stars It helps that wireless technology is also a lot more advanced now than 14 years ago. Sievert said T-Mobile has also been able to capitalize on the fact that it has spent a lot on wireless spectrum auctions to fill out its 5G coverage map across the country.  \u201cIt\u2019s about more devices being able to connect customers with devices that serve all purposes in their life, including rapid growth of 5G home broadband,\u201d Sievert said.  \u201cWe feel so fortunate to have this massive multi-year lead on the 5G race in this category,\u201d he noted, adding that T-Mobile was \u201cdead last\u201d in the 4G market not that long ago.  But AT&T and Verizon are both ramping up their 5G coverage plans too. And let\u2019s be honest. There\u2019s not that much anymore to differentiate one wireless carrier from another. They all pretty much offer the same new and popular phones from Samsung\n            \n                (SSNLF) and the latest iPhone 14 from Apple\n            \n                (AAPL). Enter SpaceX. T-Mobile announced a joint venture with Musk\u2019s rocket launching company this year to use SpaceX\u2019s Starlink satellites to offer wireless services in areas with little to no coverage.  \u201cThe idea of being able to get you connected wherever you can see the sky, that\u2019s potentially groundbreaking,\u201d Sievert said. \u201cWe\u2019re now heads down attempting to create together a service that will connect your mobile phone directly to a satellite,\u201d he said.  Sievert said he and Musk worked together \u201con several occasions\u201d to get the deal right, adding that he was impressed by \u201chow mission driven\u201d Musk and the entire SpaceX leadership team are.  \u201cYou can just feel the passion when you\u2019re talking to Elon or any senior person at SpaceX that they deeply believe in the importance of what they\u2019re doing for humanity,\u201d he said.  Prepared for more competition Sievert, who has been with T-Mobile since 2012, took over as CEO in 2020 from long-time CEO John Legere. Sievert may be a little less bombastic and flamboyant than Legere, who was known for taunting the competition, not to mention his rockstar-length hair and penchant for leather jackets.  Still, Sievert remains confident that the company will continue to keep growing. To that end, he\u2019s not worried about the fact that cable companies are trying to cash in on the wireless boom too. Both Comcast\n            \n                (CMCSA) and Charter\n            \n                (CHTR) have deals with Verizon to offer cell phone service over Verizon\u2019s network. Sievert said he respects the competition from cable.  \u201cThese are very successful companies who seem very serious about the space,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019d much rather be a mobile company using advanced 5G technology to challenge the cable space than the other way around.\u201d But Sievert is not too concerned about them denting T-Mobile\u2019s growth. \u201cCable\u2019s been at it in wireless now for years, and they\u2019re realizing a certain amount of success,\u201d he said. But he added that it\u2019s been more at the lower end of the market.  T-Mobile instead wants to keep trying to attract more subscribers willing to pay up for premium packages. And Sievert said that T-Mobile can do that by continuing to market itself as the so-called \u201cun-carrier\u201d that is different from all its rivals. That includes the heavy use of its prominent magenta logo. Sievert even joked about the fact that Pantone just named Viva Magenta as its color of the year. \u201cWe\u2019re on trend for 2022 and 2023,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this has been a part of our imagery for a long time. And what we want people at one glance is to see that our company is a little different than everybody else. This isn\u2019t a tired and staid old telco. This is a technology company that\u2019s deeply passionate about what we do.\u201d ",

            "text": "The Air Force\u2019s fleet of B-2 Spirit bombers is temporarily grounded after one of the aircraft had an in-flight malfunction earlier this month.  On December 10, a B-2 had to make an emergency landing and was damaged on the runway at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. There were no injuries from the event, and no munitions aboard the aircraft, though the Air Force\u2019s 509th Bomb Wing Public Affairs announced days later there would be a \u201csafety pause\u201d of the fleet in order to inspect it further. The 509th Bomb Wing said in a news release on Tuesday evening that the stand-down was directed by Air Force Global Strike Command, and that the B-2 fleet \u201ccan be flown if directed by the commander in chief to fulfill mission requirements.\u201d  Master Sgt. Beth Del Vecchio, a spokesperson for the 509th Bomb Wing, confirmed on Tuesday that B-2 flights were currently paused as the fleet underwent an inspection, and said there is \u201cno speculated end date for the safety pause.\u201d  \u201cEvery incident is unique, and we are currently evaluating the incident and how we can mitigate future risk,\u201d Del Vecchio said. \u201cNormal operations will resume at the conclusion of the safety pause.\u201d  An Air Force spokesperson said Tuesday that the Whiteman Air Force Base runway was currently closed due to debris; the 509th Bomb Wing\u2019s news release on Tuesday says it will reopen as soon as the debris is cleared, and B-2 operations \u201cwill resume at the conclusion of the safety stand-down.\u201d The B-2 Spirit is a multi-role heavy bomber, meaning it can carry both conventional and nuclear munitions. The fleet of stealth aircraft is housed at Whiteman. According to the Air Force, the first B-2 was delivered at Whiteman in 1993, and quickly proved its combat effectiveness during Operation Allied Force, the NATO campaign against Serbia, and was later used in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.  The B-2, as well as the B-1, are expected to be replaced over time by the Air Force\u2019s new B-21 Raider, a new stealth bomber aircraft that was unveiled by Northrop Grumman earlier this month. The B-21 event was the first time a new US bomber was publicly unveiled since the B-2 Spirit in 1988.",

            "title": "Brand it like Beckham: How has this World Cup affected the \u2018brands\u2019 associated with it?",
            "text": "Traditionally billions of viewers watch the World Cup, and as they concentrate on what is happening on the pitch, the names of some of the world\u2019s biggest companies flash behind the players on a rolling, technicolored loop \u2013 Budweiser, Visa, Coca-Cola, Qatar Airways, Adidas, McDonalds, Wanda, Vivo, Hyundai Kia.  But Qatar 2022 is different. Many of these brands, particularly those with Western world roots, have become caught in the geopolitical crosshairs of this tournament, balancing their sponsorship with criticisms levelled at FIFA, soccer\u2019s world governing body, and Qatar, the host, notably around human rights issues. Not that it is affecting FIFA\u2019s bottom line. FIFA President Gianni Infantino said on Friday at a news conference that the organization has earned a record $7.5 billion in revenue through commercial deals tied to the 2022 World Cup, $1 billion more than what it earned from the 2018 World Cup. And during the next cycle building up to the 2026 World Cup held in the United States, Mexico and Canada, Infantino forecasts a revenue of $11 billion. It is not just companies who have aligned their \u2018brand\u2019 to this World Cup. There are many ex-players, including Tim Cahill, Cafu, Samuel Eto\u2019o and Xavi, who have accepted ambassador roles for the tournament.  Most prominently, David Beckham has been criticized for becoming a tournament ambassador, facing accusations that it could tarnish his own \u2018brand.\u2019  Beckham\u2019s brand is arguably as recognizable as many multinationals. As well as his ambassadorship with Qatar, Beckham has endorsements with Adidas, the Tudor watch brand and his own whiskey brand, Haig Club. Beckham is also part of the ownership team at MLS soccer club Inter Miami.  \u201cI think when engaging in any form of commercial relationship, but certainly a sponsorship or an endorsement [or] an ambassadorial role, carries with it geopolitical risk,\u201d Simon Chadwick, professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, tells CNN Sport. \u2018Big global brands\u2019 Ever since it was named in 2010 as the host nation of the 2022 World Cup, Qatar\u2019s human rights record has been in the spotlight \u2013 from the death and conditions endured by migrant workers to LGBTQ and women\u2019s rights.  Much of the criticism towards FIFA and Qatar has come from countries more able to freely do so, in Western Europe and North America, but only a fraction of the tournament\u2019s sponsors are headquartered in these regions. Brands associated with these countries, such as Adidas or McDonald\u2019s, have consumer bases all around the world, encompassing consumers with varying freedoms to criticize human rights issues. \u201cWhen the marketing teams within these big global brands are looking at the split of their customer base, ethical consumers in Western Europe or in North America, as an example, only form a part of that. And they would have gone into the tournament knowing that,\u201d Ben Peppi, head of sports services at JMW Solicitors, tells CNN Sport.   FIFA\u2019s shift towards companies based outside of Western Europe and North America was accelerated by the exodus of some sponsors following the 2015 corruption scandal involving FIFA, but also reflects the globalization of Asian consumer brands, Peppi adds. Wanda, a conglomerate based in China, Qatar Airways and Qatar Energy all belong to FIFA\u2019s top tier of sponsors and are unlikely to be balancing the same brand perception dilemmas as their Western counterparts.  As Chadwick points out, Qatar Airways is state owned and \u201cnot going to start engaging in a consumer activism campaign against its own government.\u201d The four Chinese brands that sponsor the tournament \u2013 Wanda, Vivo, Mengniu Dairy and Hisense \u2013 are unlikely to take a particularly strident activist stance on an issue such as LGBTQ rights since that \u201cturns a spotlight on China,\u201d Chadwick adds.  \u2018A lot of sponsors have stayed very quiet\u2019 Some brands, however, have addressed the human rights issues surrounding Qatar 2022. Denmark\u2019s kit manufacturer Hummel provided the team with \u201ctoned down\u201d kits in response to the alleged human rights violations that have occurred in Qatar, although FIFA later forbade the Danish national team from wearing these shirts at the World Cup.  Meanwhile, German supermarket chain Rewe ended its partnership with the German Football Association after FIFA\u2019s decision to punish players wearing \u201cOneLove\u201d armbands that aimed to promote inclusivity.  But aside from these examples \u2013 notably taken by national team sponsors rather than tournament sponsors \u2013 companies have remained relatively quiet during this month-long competition, one of the biggest, most lucrative events in sport.  FIFA divides its tournament sponsors into three tiers \u2013 \u201cpartners\u201d composed of Coca-Cola, Adidas, Visa, Wanda, Qatar Airways, Qatar Energy and Hyundai Kia; \u201cWorld Cup sponsors,\u201d including Budweiser, McDonald\u2019s, Mengniu Dairy and Hisense; and \u201cregional supporters.\u201d  \u201cThe reality is, a lot of [FIFA\u2019s partners] have stayed very quiet,\u201d Peppi says. \u201cThe FIFA World Cup is one of the most valuable pieces of intellectual property within sport, if not the most valuable and, as a result of that, is very tightly controlled and governed,\u201d Peppi adds.  In July, three human rights organizations \u2013 Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Fair Square \u2013 wrote to FIFA\u2019s 14 corporate partners and World Cup sponsors \u201curging them to call on the football body to remedy abuses of migrant workers linked to preparations for the World Cup.\u201d  It is difficult to verify how many migrant workers have died as a result of work done on projects connected to the tournament. The Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat. The report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.  In an interview with Piers Morgan, which aired on TalkTV in November, Hassan Al-Thawadi, Secretary General of the Supreme Committee, an organization charged with organizing the World Cup, said that between 400 and 500 migrant workers have died as a result of work done on projects connected to the tournament \u2013 a greater figure than Qatari officials have cited previously.  Al-Thawadi said in the same interview that three migrant workers had died in incidents directly connected with construction of World Cup stadiums, and 37 deaths were attributed to other reasons.  According to Amnesty, four sponsors \u2013 AB InBev/Budweiser, Adidas, Coca-Cola, and McDonald\u2019s \u2013 stated their support for financial compensation to migrant workers and their families who suffered death or injury, wage theft or debt from illegal recruitment while preparing the tournament. The other 10, Amnesty says, did not respond to written requests to discuss tournament-related abuses.  CNN has reached out to McDonald\u2019s, Hyundai, Visa, Budweiser, Qatar Airways, Wanda and Vivo for comment as to how they balance these sponsorship campaigns in relation to the discussion of human rights\u2019 issues surrounding Qatar 2022, but at the time of publication had not yet received a response.  However, Adidas told CNN that it had \u201cbeen engaged with partners \u2013 including the Qatari government, the Supreme Committee for the delivery of the World Cup, the International Labor Organization (ILO), international human rights and labor advocacy groups, and trade unions \u2013 to improve the human rights situation. The progress achieved includes the establishment of an independent ILO office as a local monitoring body, strengthening the rights of migrant workers and a national minimum wage.\u201d Coca-Cola said in a statement to CNN that \u201cit has played an instrumental role in the creation of the FIFA Human Rights Advisory Board, the first such entity created by a global sports governing body.\u201d \u201cToday, we continue to work with FIFA and the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy to build on Qatar\u2019s development of a regulatory and remedy framework for the protection of migrant worker rights\u2026While these efforts have been groundbreaking, we recognize that more can be done to ensure respect for the human rights of all workers involved in the Qatar World Cup, including providing effective remedy to those who are unable to access avenues for redress.\u201d \u2018Now Beckham\u2019s brand is not consumer brands\u2019 Former England captain David Beckham is another ex-player who has performed an ambassadorial role for Qatar 2022. Beckham\u2019s association with this World Cup was brutally put under the spotlight by British comedian Joe Lycett, who last month challenged the widely held assumption that the former England captain was an LGBTQ ally. \u201cBeckham was the commercialization of late 20th century sports personified. If he was doing then what he\u2019s doing now, I would be concerned about the value of his brand but \u2026 now, he\u2019s a sports entrepreneur, and his brand is not consumer brands,\u201d Chadwick says.  \u201cHe\u2019s trying to market himself to decision makers and financiers who are involved in elite professional sport around the world. What he\u2019s interested in is making sure that his [Inter Miami] franchise in the United States is financially sustainable.\u201d Beckham\u2019s spokesperson told CNN via a statement Friday that: \u201cDavid has been involved in a number of World Cups and other major international tournaments both as a player and an ambassador and he\u2019s always believed that sport has the power to be a force for good in the world.\u201d  \u201cWe hope that these conversations will lead to greater understanding and empathy towards all people and that progress will be achieved.\u201d  Some brands sponsoring the Qatar World Cup drape their logos in rainbow flags and run inclusive campaigns during Pride Month \u2013 when LGTBQ communities celebrate the freedom to be themselves \u2013 as a show of support towards LGBTQ people. Coca-Cola was an official sponsor of London and Brighton Pride 2022. Earlier this year, the Visa Everywhere Initiative LGBTQ+ Special Edition Competition recognized LGBTQ+ founders transforming the FinTech Industry.  Adidas has produced rainbow clothing ranges for Pride; McDonald\u2019s has committed itself to \u201csupporting and championing the LGBTQ+ community during Pride and beyond\u201d; Budweiser has produced Pride cups; while Hyundai-Kia said in an advert that it supports \u201cthe journey of the LGBTQ+ community. Not just during Pride Month, but 365 days a year.\u201d  Adidas said in a statement to CNN that: \u201cWe have strongly advocated for unrestricted access for all visitors regardless of nationality, religion, sexual orientation or ethnic background. We expect the World Cup to be fully accessible to all visitors. If there are any infringements, we are pursuing the matter.\u201d  Coca-Cola said in a statement to CNN that it strives for \u201cdiversity, inclusion and equality in our business, and we support these rights throughout society as well. Our experience has shown that change takes time and must be achieved through sustained collaboration and active involvement. We have long supported the LGBTQI+ community, and we will continue our work to respectfully advocate for our values through our policies and practices throughout the world.\u201d \u2018The core product is football\u2019 Although human rights issues have dominated much of this tournament, the sport itself has not been overshadowed. FIFA says that this World Cup has drawn in a record-breaking television audience, captivated by the storylines that have unfolded on the pitch, from Saudi Arabia\u2019s shock victory over Argentina and Messi\u2019s quest for a World Cup trophy, to Morocco\u2019s historic run to the semifinals.  \u201cThe core product is the football,\u201d Chadwick says. \u201cAnd so I think they [companies] will see that as the easy way out.\u201d With this enormous audience, Adidas expects World Cup sales of around \u20ac400 million ($421million), a company spokesperson told Reuters.  Meanwhile, McDonald\u2019s launched its \u201clargest global marketing campaign ever,\u201d to coincide with the 2022 World Cup, its Global Chief Marketing Officer said in a statement.  And on the day the World Cup began, FIFA announced it had \u201csold out all sponsorship tiers\u201d and that the tournament would be backed by a \u201cfull quota of Partners, Sponsors and Regional Supporters.\u201d  Aside from Budweiser, which made headlines two days before the tournament began when FIFA confirmed that no alcohol would be sold inside stadiums, brands associated with FIFA have maintained a relatively low profile throughout the World Cup.  With this World Cup nearing its grand finale, the brands betting on its success will be focusing on the football and after two consecutive tournament posing geopolitical challenges for global brands to navigate, the association with the product on the pitch seems to be enough, for now, to override the controversies off it.

            "text": "Virgin Atlantic plans to operate a Boeing 787 from London to New York, powered solely by waste oils and fats, a move hailed as a step toward reducing aviation\u2019s significant environmental impact. Billed as the \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d net zero transatlantic flight, the aircraft will hit the skies in 2023 fueled entirely by what\u2019s known as sustainable aviation fuel. SAF is an alternative to fossil fuels that uses ingredients like cooking oils and agriculture waste, cutting carbon emissions by an average of 80%, according to IATA, the International Air Transport Association.  In a statement, the UK government, which contributed funds for the project, claimed the transatlantic flight will be totally net zero in terms of carbon output due to the SAF, and because it will offset any emissions through \u201cbiochar credits\u201d \u2013 payments that support the use of an energy process that results in the safe storage of carbon. While the flight is likely to be seen as a step in the right direction for aviation, it will do little to win over critics who have said similar one-off projects are aimed more at easing the conscience of passengers. They say the air industry is trying to give the impression it\u2019s on the brink of full sustainability, rather than its stated goal of halving 2005 emission levels by 2050, and that SAF use can still have environmental consequences. In a statement announcing the flight, Virgin Atlantic CEO Shari Weiss suggested \u201cthe research and results\u201d of the pioneering 2023 flight \u201cwill be a huge step in fast tracking SAF use across the aviation industry and support the investment, collaboration and urgency needed to produce SAF at scale.\u201d Virgin Atlantic has yet to confirm when the flight will take place, but announced it\u2019ll be sometime in the coming year. More sustainable flying SAF\u2019s not a new invention \u2013 it\u2019s actually been around since 2011, and IATA data says that since then, more than 450,000 flights have taken to the skies powered, at least in part, by SAF.  Despite its potential to reduce airplane environmental impact, SAF use is still limited due to costs associated with production and regulatory concerns. \u201cThere\u2019s no real business case for the sector to invest in it at the moment,\u201d Andreas Schafer, a professor of energy and transport at University College London, told CNN Travel earlier in 2022. Still, one of SAF\u2019s major advantages is it can be used in pre-existing aircraft \u2013 like Virgin\u2019s 787 \u2013 with little need for expensive modifications. \u201cThis is critical and very beneficial for the aviation industry, because there is no need to invest in new infrastructure or new aircraft, and it\u2019s great for airports too, because they can use the same storage and fueling infrastructure \u2013 from that perspective, SAF is excellent,\u201d said Schafer.  Virgin Atlantic\u2019s upcoming flight has also involved plane maker Boeing and engine builder Rolls-Royce. Virgin\u2019s 787 is installed with Trent 1000 engines, which Rolls-Royce says have previously been proven to fly with a blend of SAF and conventional jet fuel.  Rolls-Royce Head of Sustainability Rachel Everard added that, thanks to the flight, \u201cby the the end of 2023 we will have proven that our whole family of Trent engines and business aviation engines are compatible with 100% SAF.\u201d Other high profile SAF tests have taken place recently. In March 2022, an Airbus flew an A380 for three hours powered by SAF. In 2021, United Airlines flew one of its aircraft from Chicago to Washington, powered by SAF.

            "title": "Elon Musk sells another 22 million Tesla shares for $3.6 billion",
            "text": "Elon Musk just sold another 22 million shares of Tesla, raising $3.6 billion. Musk sold the shares on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday this week. The sales were disclosed in an SEC filing late Wednesday.  Musk did not disclose the reason for the sales in the filing. They\u2019re his first sales of Tesla stock since early November, when he sold 19.5 million shares shortly after closing on his purchase of Twitter. Before Musk first started his efforts to buy Twitter, he rarely sold Tesla shares. Typically his sales were tied to what he needed to sell to pay taxes he owed on the exercise of options.  But since the first announcing plans to buy Twitter in April he has sold a total of $22.9 billion worth of Tesla stock. Those stock sales, and the amount of his attention that has been focused on Twitter, has worried Tesla shareholders and analysts. \u201cThe Twitter nightmare continues as Musk uses Tesla as his own ATM machine to keep funding the red ink at Twitter which gets worse by the day as more advertisers flee the platform with controversy increasing driven by Musk,\u201d wrote Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, in a note early Wednesday. \u201cWhen does it end? This remains the worry on the Tesla story as Musk has managed to change the narrative of Tesla from the fundamental EV transformation story to a \u2018source of funds\u2019 funding the Twitter turnaround which we believe will go down as the most overpaid tech acquisition in the history of merger and acquisitions and remains a train wreck situation.\u201d Musk\u2019s sales this week represent just less than 5% of the Tesla shares he held outright.  Even with these latest sales he owns 423.6 million shares of Tesla through a trust he controls, worth about $69 billion based on the average sale price he received this week, and he has options to buy nearly 279 million more shares, worth nearly $39 billion after the paying the exercise price. He\u2019s likely to get even more options early next year after Tesla\u2019s upcoming financial results are reported. But the value of those shares have been dropping steadily. Tesla shares are down 55% so far this year. The drop in the value of Tesla shares is a major reason that he recently lost his title as the richest person on the planet. Ives told CNN it\u2019s possible that Musk is using the funds from the Tesla stock sales to cover losses at Twitter, or to pay down loans or other investors he used to help fund his $44 billion purchase. Neither would be good news for Twitter or Tesla, he said. Ives said Tesla\u2019s board, which is made up of Musk fans, may have to place some limits on him. \u201cMusk is the heart and lungs of Tesla, but his attention is solely focused on Twitter, and that and selling stock on a continual basis is not a good combination for Tesla,\u201d Ives said. \u201cWhile 20% of the Tesla stock decline is due to concerns about demand and growing EV competition, 80% is because of his focus on Twitter. Twitter needs to have a CEO who\u2019s not Musk.\u201d Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) stock was down 1% in premarket trading. ",

            "title": "United places order for 200 Boeing planes, giving two troubled jets a vote of confidence",
            "text": "United Airlines placed a massive order for at least 200 Boeing planes on Tuesday, split between two models dogged by recent problems: the 737 Max and the 787 Dreamliner. It\u2019s a crucial vote of confidence for Boeing, which took tens of billions of dollars in financial losses due to the problems with the two planes. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded the 737 Max for 20 months starting in March 2019, halting deliveries of the jets, after two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. The 787 was not grounded but the FAA halted deliveries for roughly a year due to quality control issues.  Even beyond those problems, Boeing has been losing the competition with European rival Airbus on new orders, especially for single-aisle jets like the 737 Max. It has done better in competition for widebody plane orders, but has faced problems there as well, with delays for a new model of the 777, the 777X, and the halt in 787 deliveries. Later Tuesday Boeing reported that it had received orders for a total of 571 commercial planes through November of this year, net cancellations. So United\u2019s order for 200 jets by itself represented 35% of the orders the aircraft maker had already reported for the year. But even adding those 200 jets doesn\u2019t bring Boeing\u2019s total near to the 825 plane orders that  Airbus has booked, net its own cancellations. While neither United\n            \n                (UAL) nor Boeing\n            \n                (BA) would reveal pricing details, the list price of the jets total more than $37 billion. Even with the deep discounts typical of such purchases, the order will likely amount to tens of billions of dollars in sales Boeing\n            \n                (BA) desperately needs.  United said the firm orders for 100 twin-aisle 787 Dreamliners, along with an option to buy 100 more, will represent the largest widebody jet order on record by any US carrier. \u201cThe Boeing team is honored by United\u2019s trust in our family of airplanes to connect people and transport cargo around the world for decades to come,\u201d said Stan Deal, CEO of Boeing\u2019s commercial aircraft division. Shares of Boeing rose 3% in premarket trading, following the announcement. The 787 is a plane used primarily on long-range overseas routes. The model\u2019s purchase represents United\u2019s belief that there is pent-up demand for international travel, which has not bounced back as quickly as US domestic passenger demand over the last year. Some countries \u2014 notably China \u2014 still have strict restrictions on flying into the country, and some passengers are concerned about foreign travel. But United will take delivery of the planes over the course of the next 10 years, during which time any restrictions and concerns may become distant memories. And the first 100 Dreamliners it receives will replace retiring older 757, 767 and 777 jets already in United\u2019s fleet. Some of those older planes date back at least 30 years. United\u2019s options for 100 additional Dreamliners represents the company\u2019s plans to expand its fleet and its reach into international markets. The significant order makes United the \u201cflag carrier of the United States and the leading airline of around the globe,\u201d United CEO Scott Kirby said Tuesday in an interview with CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow on CNN This Morning. \u201cThis is just the next step in that path to replace some of our older 767s that are at the end of their life, but also to create growth opportunities for years to come in the international network for years to come,\u201d Kirby said. He also didn\u2019t express any hesitation about ordering two Boeing planes that had trouble in the past, saying a \u201cfew tough years made [Boeing] stronger\u201d and noting that United has always had a \u201cgreat partnership\u201d with the aerospace company. United generally picks Boeing over Airbus The order, while an important lift for Boeing, isn\u2019t a total surprise.  Airlines have a financial interest in sticking with the same model plane once they commit to it. The companies are able to save on pilot training and spare parts costs by populating their fleets with the same models. Unlike a driver who can seamlessly move between car makers, commercial pilots are limited to flying only the model on which they are certified. While United has some orders with Airbus\n            \n                (EADSF), nearly 80% of its existing fleet is composed of Boeing jets. \u201cWe have a large installed base of 787s,\u201d said Kirby when asked on a press call about potentially increasing purchases of a competing Airbus model. \u201cThe economics of bringing in another fleet type doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Boeing started taking orders for the Dreamliner in 2004, and United was one of its earliest US customers. It is made of a lighter-weight composite material than the aluminum used to build most commercial jets, giving it much better fuel economy and thus operational savings compared to the older planes it will replace in the United fleet. United has yet to decide how many of each of the three different models of the Dreamliner it will take. The 100 737 Max jets United is buying includes 44 planes for which it already had an option to purchase, and 56 new orders. In June 2021, it announced the purchase of 200 of the 737 Max jets, along with 70 competing planes from Airbus, in the largest aircraft order that United has ever placed.  \u2013CNN\u2019s Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report.",

            "text": "Semiconductor giant TSMC was feted this week by US President Joe Biden and Apple CEO Tim Cook during a ceremony to unveil its $40 billion manufacturing site in Arizona \u2014 a huge investment designed to help secure America\u2019s supply of the most advanced chips.  But back home in Taiwan, there is deep unease over the growing political and commercial pressure being applied to the world\u2019s most important chipmaker to expand internationally. The company is building a facility in Japan and considering investing in Europe. \u201cThey\u2019re like the Hope Diamond of semiconductors. Everybody wants them,\u201d said G. Dan Hutcheson, vice chair of TechInsights, a research organization specializing in chips. (The Hope Diamond is the world\u2019s largest blue diamond, which now resides at the Smithsonian Institute\u2019s National Museum of Natural History in Washington.) \u201cCustomers in China want them to build there. Customers in the US want them there. And customers in Europe want them there too,\u201d he added. Apart from the risk that TSMC will take its most advanced technology with it \u2014 stripping Taiwan of one of its unique assets and reducing employment opportunities locally \u2014 there are fears that a diminished presence for the company could expose Taipei to greater pressure from Beijing, which has vowed to take control of the self-ruled island, by force if necessary.  TSMC is considered a national treasure in Taiwan and supplies tech giants including Apple\n            \n                (AAPL) and Qualcomm\n            \n                (QCOM). It mass produces the most advanced semiconductors in the world, components that are vital to the smooth running of everything from smartphones to washing machines. The company is perceived as being so valuable to the global economy, as well as to China \u2014 which claims Taiwan as its own territory despite having never controlled it \u2014 that it is sometimes even referred to as forming part of a \u201csilicon shield\u201d against a potential military invasion by Beijing. TSMC\u2019s presence gives a strong incentive to the West to defend Taiwan against any attempt by China to take it by force.  \u201cThe idea is that if Taiwan became a powerhouse in semiconductors, then America would have to support and defend it,\u201d said Hutcheson. \u201cThe strategy has been super successful.\u201d Secret deal? A day before Tuesday\u2019s Phoenix ceremony Chiu Chenyuan, a lawmaker with the opposition Taiwan People\u2019s Party, grilled Foreign Minister Joseph Wu about whether there is a \u201csecret deal\u201d with the United States to disadvantage Taiwan\u2019s chip industry.  Chiu claimed that the chip giant was under political pressure to move its operations and its most advanced technology to the US. He cited the transfer of 300 people, including TSMC engineers, to the Arizona plant. In response, Wu said there was no secret deal, nor was there any attempt to diminish the importance of Taiwan to TSMC. Patrick Chen, the Taipei-based head of research at CL Securities Taiwan, said there was a common concern on the island about TSMC\u2019s growing international importance, the pressure it is facing to expand, and what that means for Taiwan. \u201cIt is similar to what happened in the US in the 70s and 80s when manufacturing jobs were being shifted away from the States into other countries. Many local jobs were lost and cities bankrupted,\u201d he said.  CNN has asked TSMC for comment about its expansion plans.  Its CEO, CC Wei, had previously said: \u201cEvery region is important to TSMC,\u201d adding that it would \u201ccontinue to serve all the customers all over the world.\u201d Increasing importance Founded in 1987 by Morris Chang, TSMC is not a household name outside Taiwan, even though it produces an estimated 90% of the world\u2019s super-advanced computer chips.  Semiconductors are an indispensable part of just about every electronic device. They are difficult to make because of the high cost of development and the level of knowledge required, meaning much of the production is concentrated among a handful of suppliers. Concerned about losing access to crucial chips, particularly as tension has escalated between China and the United States, as well as between Beijing and Taipei, governments and major consumer-facing companies like Apple have asked semiconductor companies to localize their operations, according to experts. \u201cTSMC\u2019s decision to expand its Arizona investment is evidence that politics and geopolitical risks will play a bigger role than previously in supply chain decisions,\u201d said Chris Miller, author of \u201cChip War: the Fight for the World\u2019s Most Critical Technology\u201d.  \u201cIt also suggests that TSMC\u2019s customers are asking for more geographic diversification, which is something that wasn\u2019t previously a key concern of major customers.\u201d On Tuesday, TSMC said it was increasing its investment in the US by building a second semiconductor factory in Arizona and raising its total investment there from $12 billion to $40 billion. Staying put Chang had previously said its plant in Arizona would produce 3-nanometer chips, the company\u2019s most advanced technology, as advances in chip manufacturing require etching ever-smaller transistors onto silicon wafers. These announcements alarm politicians like Chiu of the Taiwan People\u2019s Party\u2019s. He frets about the island losing out as TSMC is courted globally. Chen of CL Securities said national security concerns among governments globally are driving TSMC\u2019s expansion. But he believes the company will continue to manufacture its most advanced technology at home.  \u201cThis would make economic sense given [the] lower salaries [and] higher quality of Taiwanese engineers,\u201d he said, adding that the company needs the approval of the Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs to move its most advanced technologies abroad, which it was unlikely to give. Many experts believe that by the time 3-nanometer chips are being made in Arizona, TSMC\u2019s Taiwan operations would be producing even smaller, more advanced chips.  Hutcheson also believes TSMC will keep its most cutting-edge development teams in Taiwan. \u201cOnce you have a team of people doing development work, they work very closely together. You don\u2019t want to disrupt that. It\u2019s not an easy thing to do,\u201d he said.  \u2014 CNN\u2019s Wayne Chang contributed to this report. ",

            "title": "Etihad\u2019s \u2018Greenliner\u2019 shows a glimpse of a more sustainable future for aviation",
            "text": "While some delegates at November\u2019s COP27 climate conference were criticized for arriving by private jet, others arrived in Egypt aboard flights that were described as being emission-free, as they were powered fully by sustainable aviation fuel. The flights were part of a program called \u201cGreenliner,\u201d run by Etihad Airways, the national carrier of the United Arab Emirates, as a testbed for sustainable air travel solutions.  Commercial aviation accounted for just over 2% of global CO2 emissions in 2021, which suggests it may be a modest contributor to climate change. But the number doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, as air travel affects the climate in more complex ways than just carbon emissions, and its impact is predicted to rise in the future, as more and more people will want to fly. Whereas renewable energy and electric vehicles offer clear pathways to decarbonize sectors like power and road transport, it\u2019s less straightforward for the aviation industry. As a result, the industry is not on track to meet its net zero target by 2050, and is banking on two thirds of that transition coming from sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). It\u2019s made from waste products and can curb emissions by 80% on average \u2014 but it currently accounts for just 1% of global jet fuel usage. Something needs to change, fast. That\u2019s why SAF is one of the key elements of the \u201cGreenliner\u201d program. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a call to action,\u201d says Mariam AlQubaisi, head of sustainability at Etihad. \u201cThe idea came about in late 2019 to launch a message to the industry: let\u2019s try everything possible to decarbonize.\u201d The program is based around the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, but Etihad has a similar initiative, called Sustainable50, dedicated to the Airbus A350. Since its launch, Greenliner has championed the adoption of SAF and tackled issues such as plastic waste and inefficient flight routes.  The \u201cGreenliner\u201d moniker is often used to refer to a specific 787 aircraft, which AlQubaisi calls the program\u2019s \u201cmascot.\u201d Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s painted green \u2013 which she says is a way pre-empting accusations of greenwashing.  \u201cAny project any airline would launch will always be scrutinized under the umbrella of greenwashing,\u201d she explains. \u201cPainting the aircraft green was a way to challenge that and say it is dedicated to a purpose. We\u2019re owning up to our emissions: We\u2019re saying yes, we\u2019re a major emitter \u2014 but we\u2019re doing something about it.\u201d A quick fix Etihad ferried delegates to Sharm El Sheik in Egypt, where COP27 took place, by adding a stopover to its regular Washington Dulles to Abu Dhabi service. The flight was described as \u201cemission-free\u201d due to being powered entirely by SAF \u2014 but confusingly, the planes actually used traditional jet fuel.  The apparent absurdity highlights challenges with both SAF infrastructure and communicating green initiatives. The plane didn\u2019t have SAF on board because current regulations prohibit commercial flights from using more than 50% SAF, as not all engines are certified for higher concentrations. Plus, not all airports have the infrastructure to use it, and the green fuel must come from a production facility relatively close to the airport to avoid canceling out the reduction in flight emissions with those coming from transportation. So, Etihad purchased enough SAF to power the flight and delivered the fuel to Los Angeles International Airport, which has the necessary infrastructure and facilities. There, the SAF was integrated into the airport\u2019s refueling system with traditional fuel, and used by whichever aircraft were refueling that day. This system is called \u201cBook & Claim,\u201d and it\u2019s currently the only way for a flight to claim it\u2019s using 100% SAF. The emissions are simply offset elsewhere, rather than on one specific flight.   AlQubaisi calls it a \u201cquick fix\u201d until regulations change, but for SAF to become more widespread, more progress is required. \u201cThe price of SAF is four to five times that of conventional jet fuel and it\u2019s limited in supply. Only two bodies are allowed to certify it, so until we have more and until governments intervene to incentivize production, SAF will continue to be limited,\u201d she says. Etihad has used SAF extensively in a series of \u201cEcoFlights,\u201d which employ the carrier\u2019s 787 and A350 fleet to assess new sustainability initiatives. These culminated in the airline\u2019s most environmentally friendly flight ever, a London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi service on October 23, 2021. The flight, Etihad says, achieved a 72% overall reduction in emissions by using 38% SAF (via \u201cBook & Claim\u201d) and adopted a host of other measures, such as reducing single-use plastic by 80% and delivering baggage via electric tractors.  It was also the first commercial flight to test a novel way to combat emissions, by using navigation and artificial intelligence to avoid the formation of contrails. These are vapor trails that form when ice crystals coalesce around the exhaust gasses emitted by aircraft engines, and result in temporary clouds that trap heat, contributing significantly to the warming effect of air travel. But modifying the plane\u2019s route or altitude can help dramatically. \u201cThe warming you\u2019re avoiding by simply adding a little more time to the journey is up to 60%, if not more,\u201d says AlQubaisi. \u201cWhat\u2019s nice about this is that it\u2019s done via specific algorithms that make the system become smarter the more we use it.\u201d A greener future? Etihad\u2019s \u201cEcoFlights\u201d have trialed a range of technologies and techniques aimed at reducing emissions, such as an optimized climb and a continuous descent, last-minute engine start-up, taxi procedures using a single engine, and washing the engine with a special foam that improves efficiency by reducing the build-up of deposits.   Many of these techniques have since made it into everyday operations, and in recognition of these efforts Etihad was named \u201cEnvironmental Airline of the Year 2022\u201d at the annual Airline Ratings awards. According to Geoffrey Thomas,  Airline Ratings\u2019 editor-in-chief, Etihad has shown \u201cclear leadership in the push for sustainable flight.\u201d There\u2019s still a lot to be done, AlQubaisi says: \u201cThis is an industry that has had free rein on pollution for many years and it\u2019s about time we own up to our responsibility to decarbonize.\u201d The key to achieving a greener aviation is everyone working toward it, she adds: \u201cHopefully you\u2019ll hear of more airlines joining the Greeliner program, because it doesn\u2019t matter who does it first \u2014 what matters is who does it better. \u201cWe can do better together, because sustainability is not an area for competition, it\u2019s an area for collaboration.\u201d",

            "text": "The United Kingdom, Japan and Italy announced Friday they are teaming up to build a sixth-generation fighter jet, designed to rival or eclipse the best warplanes now employed by the likes of China and Russia \u2013 and possibly even the United States, the main ally of the trio. \u201cWe are announcing the Global Combat Air Program (GCAP) \u2013 an ambitious endeavour to develop a next-generation fighter aircraft by 2035,\u201d British, Japanese and Italian leaders said in a joint statement. The leaders\u2019 statement did not mention China or Russia by name, but said the new fighter jet is needed because \u201cthreats and aggression are increasing\u201d against the \u201crules-based, free and open international order.\u201d \u201cDefending our democracy, economy and security, and protecting regional stability, are ever more important,\u201d the leaders said. In a separate statement, the British government said development of the new warplane is expected to begin in 2024, and it is expected to be flying by 2035. It will showcase technologies from each of the three partners, the British statement said. \u201cThe ambition is for this to be a next-generation jet enhanced by a network of capabilities such as uncrewed aircraft, advanced sensors, cutting-edge weapons and innovative data systems,\u201d it added. The new jet is seen as a replacement for Britain\u2019s Typhoon fighters and Japan\u2019s F-2s. The new program will see Britain, Japan and Italy going their own way without the assistance of the US, the world\u2019s preeminent warplane maker. All three countries are part of the US fifth-generation F-35 stealth fighter program, under which all three fly the F-35 and versions of the warplane are assembled in Italy and Japan. The new jet is not expected to affect the F-35 program. US backs allies\u2019 plan In a joint statement with the Japanese Defense Ministry, the Pentagon backed the development of the new warplane. \u201cThe United States supports Japan\u2019s security and defense cooperation with likeminded allies and partners, including with the United Kingdom and Italy \u2013 two close partners of both of our countries \u2013 on the development of its next fighter aircraft,\u201d the US-Japan statement said. Meanwhile, the UK-Japan-Italy statement said the new plane would be designed to integrate with the defense programs of all their allies and partners.  \u201cFuture interoperability with the United States, with NATO and with our partners across Europe, the Indo-Pacific and globally \u2013 is reflected in the name we have chosen for our program. This concept will be at the center of its development,\u201d it said. The leaders said the GCAP program \u201cwill support the sovereign capability of all three countries to design, deliver and upgrade cutting-edge combat air capabilities.\u201d Critics say that strict US export controls on military technology have sometimes limited what customers of planes like the F-35 can do to adapt them to their specific needs. The US also has a sixth-generation fighter jet \u2013 known as the Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program \u2013 in the works. It is designed to be the successor to its F-22, which along with the F-35, is considered the world\u2019s top fighter jet. The NGAD program has similar aims to the joint UK-Japan-Italy plan. \u201cThe Air Force intends for NGAD to replace the F-22 fighter jet beginning in 2030, possibly including a combination of crewed and uncrewed aircraft,\u201d a US Congressional Research document says. But as of now the US is pursuing the NGAD program alone. Shared economic interests The British, Japanese and Italian leaders highlighted the benefits of working together. \u201cIt will deepen our defense cooperation, science and technology collaboration, integrated supply chains, and further strengthen our defense industrial base,\u201d their joint statement said. The program is also expected to provide an economic boost. \u201cThis program will deliver wider economic and industrial benefits, supporting jobs and livelihoods across Japan, Italy and the UK,\u201d the statement said. The British statement said a 2021 analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers predicted the new warplane program could support about 21,000 jobs a year by 2050 and contribute an estimated $32.1 billion (\u00a326.2 billion) to the economy. Meanwhile, China and Russia are also thought to be pursuing sixth-generation aircraft. China and Russia now fly fifth-generation fighters \u2013 Beijing\u2019s J-20 and J-31 jets and Moscow\u2019s Su-57. But the US-designed F-35s are widely seen as equal to or better than the Chinese or Russian aircraft.",

The plane, delivered to China Eastern, has 164 seats and was painted with \u201cthe world\u2019s first C919\u201d on its side in Chinese and English. Its maiden route will be between Shanghai and the capital Beijing, industry sources have said. China Eastern said Friday it plans to receive the remaining four of its first batch of C919 orders over the next two years, according to Shanghai\u2019s The Paper, a state-owned newspaper. That compares with earlier plans to get all four next year. The airline did not respond immediately to a request for comment. China\u2019s narrowbody jet ambitions intensified over the last few years amid conflicts with the United States from trade to technology that made China increasingly concerned about being overly dependent on Airbus and Boeing. Commercial Aviation Corp of China (COMAC) is expected to produce around 25 C919s per year by 2030, far lower than the current monthly rates of narrowbody production at its rivals, according to Jefferies analysts. COMAC did not immediately respond to request for comment.

            "title": "The very last 747 jumbo jet just rolled off Boeing\u2019s assembly line",
            "text": "After 53 years and more than 1,570 planes, the last Boeing 747 rolled off the assembly line in Washington state Tuesday evening, on its way to serve as a cargo plane. The once-groundbreaking jumbo jet, with the distinctive second-floor bulge, is perhaps the most notable and popular plane Boeing has ever built. It was even big enough to be used to ferry the Space Shuttle from landing strips in California to its launch site in Florida. And it is set to launch a new type of spacecraft by Virgin Orbit as soon as next week, after carrying it aloft under its wing. The 747 was once the choice of the rich and glamorous, and even royalty. Many movies, including the 1973 James Bond classic \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d featured the plane, or sets made to look like the first class lounge on its upper level. The 747 still serves as Air Force One, as it has since 1990. Two already-assembled planes are undergoing work right now to be transformed into the next generation of the presidential jet. Those planes won\u2019t be delivered for at least four years due to delays.  Other than that use, the 747\u2019s days as a passenger plane are now almost completely behind it. Airlines have moved away from planes with four fuel-guzzling engines like the 747. Rival Airbus\n            \n                (EADSF) dropped its own two-level jumbo jet, the A380, in 2019.  Boeing had signaled in 2020 that it would stop building the 747, even in its freighter form, as customers bought either the more fuel-efficient 777 freighter or saved money by reconditioning former 747 passenger jets as freighters. It has not yet announced plans for the factory in Everett, Washington, where it has been building the 747, but it does expect to keep it open. In order to build the massive plane the facility is 200 million cubic feet, which Boeing says makes it the world\u2019s largest building by volume. The passenger versions of the plane could carry between 400 to 500 passengers, at its maximum about twice as many passengers as one of Boeing\u2019s current widebody jets, the 787-8 Dreamliner. But Boeing hasn\u2019t built a passenger version of the 747 since it delivered the last one to Korean Airlines in 2017. This last 747 will go to Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings\n            \n                (AAWW), which will operate the plane for Swiss logistics company Kuehne+Nagel. Tuesday\u2019s final plane will be flown to another Boeing facility shop for painting and other final details, before being delivered to Atlas early next year. Today there are only 44 passenger versions of the 747 still in service, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. More than half of those \u2014 25 \u2014 are flown by Lufthansa.  That total is down from more than 130 in service as passenger jets at the end of 2019, just before the pandemic crippled demand for air travel, especially on international routes on which the 747 and other widebody jets were primarily used. Most of those passenger versions of the jets were grounded during the early months of the pandemic and never returned to service. But there are still 314 747 freighters in use, according to Cirium, many of which were initially used as passenger jets before being renovated into freighters.  \u201cThe 747-8 is an incredibly capable aircraft, with capacity that is unmatched by any other freighter in production,\u201d said UPS in 2020, when Boeing signaled it would soon stop building the jet. \u201cWith a maximum payload of 307,000 lbs., we use them on long, high-volume routes, connecting Asia, North America, Europe and the Middle East.\u201d The current version of the 747 is 250 feet and 2 inches long, the longest commercial plane now in service, or about twice the length of the Wright Brothers\u2019 first flight. It has a wingspan of 224 feet and 5 inches. Boeing delivered the first 747 passenger jets in December 1969 to two airlines that no longer exist \u2014 TWA and Pan Am. Delta Air Lines\n            \n                (DAL) was the last US airline to fly a passenger version of the plane, also in 2017. That was the last year the final US 747 passenger flights \u2014 by both Delta and United\n            \n                (UAL) \u2014 drew large crowds of the plane\u2019s fans, a testament to its enduring popularity. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Jackie Wattles contributed to this report",

            "text": "The world\u2019s leading producer of advanced computer chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, announced an expanded $40 billion investment in its US production hub in Phoenix. President Joe Biden visited the manufacturer\u2019s site in Phoenix and spoke about bringing jobs and investment to Arizona, calling TSMC\u2019s commitment \u201cthe largest foreign investment in the history of this state.\u201d  \u201cAmerican manufacturing is back, folks,\u201d Biden said at the event. \u201cThese are the most advanced semiconductor chips on the planet, chips that will power iPhones and MacBooks \u2026 It could be a game changer.\u201d Why it\u2019s a big deal: TSMC produces an estimated 90% of the world\u2019s super-advanced chips \u2014 indispensable components for pretty much every device you interact with day to day, like your car and your smartphone, along with a bunch that you most likely don\u2019t, like military drones and missiles.  Some of TSMC\u2019s biggest clients include Apple\n            \n                (AAPL) and Qualcomm\n            \n                (QCOM).  It was already building one factory, set to open late next year, but the expanded investment will add a second facility that TSMC hopes will be online in 2026.  Why the big push in Phoenix? The White House is touting the new investments as a direct result of the CHIPS bill, which Biden signed this summer. That measure invests more than $200 billion to encourage companies to bring chip production back onto American soil.  The motivation to shift production closer to home gained force on both sides of the aisle early in the pandemic. Remember those long wait times for new cars, or crazy high prices for used cars? That was primarily because of a chip shortage, sparked by sudden global demand for gadgets to facilitate remote work and school.  The goal is to make sure US supplies are secure in the event of another catastrophe, while also helping to foster a resurgence of American manufacturing.  Of course, it won\u2019t be easy.  TSMC is already hitting snags in its Phoenix operation, according to the Wall Street Journal. Among them are relatively higher costs to build in the United States and a shortage of sufficiently trained personnel. But there\u2019s a political motivation also driving Taiwan-based TSMC to deepen ties with the United States. As tensions between Washington and Beijing escalate, the Biden administration has repeatedly underscored the US\u2019s commitment to defend the island in the event of a Chinese invasion.  NUMBER OF THE DAY $4.7 billion The global airline industry is expected to return to profitability in 2023, after hemorrhaging tens of billions during the worst of the pandemic. In a forecast released Tuesday, the International Air Transport Association predicted that airlines will collectively earn a net profit of $4.7 billion next year, despite a potential recession.  I guess pummeling your customers with unavoidable fees really adds up \u2014 good work, everyone.  \u2018FINANCIAL ARMAGEDDON\u2019 The debt ceiling debate is this fun little phenomenon that emerges in DC every few years, like leap year or a meteor shower, where our nation\u2019s elected officials take pettiness to the next level and drive the US economy to the brink of a calamitous default. Grab some popcorn and buckle up, America.  This week, Goldman Sachs published a report warning that the 2023 debt ceiling battle could be on par, disaster-wise, with 2011\u2019s \u2014 aka the one that cost the United States its perfect AAA credit score and sowed chaos on Wall Street.  Raising the debt limit, the bank wrote, will be \u201cnecessary but hard to achieve.\u201d  For the uninitiated: The \u201cdebt ceiling\u201d is simply the federal government\u2019s borrowing limit. Congress set it up over a century ago to keep borrowing in check. And historically, it wasn\u2019t a big deal for lawmakers to agree that they\u2019d raise the limit, because failing to do so would be, like, really really bad. (Interest rates would shoot up, the stock market would be a shambles, and the value of the US dollar would tank. The economist Mark Zandi once called it \u201cfinancial Armageddon.\u201d)    But already, Republicans are drawing battle lines, my colleague Matt Egan writes. House GOP leader Kevin MacCarthy, who is vying to become House Speaker, told CNN before the midterm election that Republicans would demand spending cuts in exchange for lifting the debt ceiling. Senator John Thune told Bloomberg last week the debt ceiling could be a way to push through budget cuts.  Goldman Sachs noted that the political environment next year will have \u201cechoes of 1995 and 2011\u201d \u2014 the two most tense standoffs over the debt limit in recent history.  The good news is we have time before things get wild. Economists at Jefferies said in a recent research report that default risk is unlikely to emerge until \u201cat least\u201d the end of September of next year.   Enjoying Nightcap?

In a just-released report, data accessed by the National Transportation Safety Board shows the pilot was below key minimum altitudes required to land in poor visibility at Montgomery County Airpark in Gaithersburg, Maryland. \u201cThe airplane descended as low as 475 feet\u201d above sea level, before it slammed into a Pepco transmission tower, the agency said in its preliminary findings. The tower is 600 feet above sea level, the NTSB notes. The crash, in dark mist on November 27, triggered a massive response of more than a hundred firefighters.  After he remained inside the mangled single-engine Mooney aircraft for eight hours, special equipment was used to rescue the pilot, 65-year-old Patrick Merkle and his female passenger. Both survived the crash with serious injuries. The NTSB notes that Merkle said in media interviews that he thought his altimeter was malfunctioning. The NTSB now says it removed the altimeter for testing and found it \u201cwell within the test allowable error at all ranges.\u201d In their report, investigators also say around the time Merkle began his approach to land, the pilot of another airplane ahead of him found the weather to be too poor and \u201crequested a diversion to another airport.\u201d",

In a forecast released Tuesday, the International Air Transport Association predicted that airlines will earn a net profit of $4.7 billion, despite fears of a global recession.  It would mark the first time the sector has made money since 2019, as fliers return to the skies after years of Covid-19 restrictions reduced demand for flights.  The industry association also said net losses for 2022 were expected to be $6.9 billion. That\u2019s less than it had previously forecast and \u201csignificantly better\u201d than both 2021 and 2020. Willie Walsh, the director general of IATA, called the projection \u201ca great achievement.\u201d But the industry still has work to do to shore up its financial position, he emphasized. \u201cA $4.7 billion profit on industry revenues of $779 billion also illustrates that there is much more ground to cover to put the global industry on a solid financial footing,\u201d he said. Consumer demand for air travel has been boosted by the reopening of borders closed by the pandemic, as well as a strong US dollar that\u2019s encouraged more Americans to travel overseas. Corporate travel has also been making a comeback.  At the same time, constraints remain on the supply of flights, including delayed plane deliveries, pilot shortages and airport infrastructure issues.

            "title": "Delta, pilots reach labor deal with 34% pay hike",
            "text": "Delta Air Lines has offered a 34% cumulative pay increase to its pilots over three years in a new contract, demonstrating the bargaining power aviators are enjoying in a short-staffed industry with booming travel demand. If the deal is approved by Delta\n            \n                (DAL) pilots, it is widely expected to act as a benchmark for contract negotiations at rivals United Airlines\n            \n                (UAL) and American Airlines\n            \n                (AAL). Delta pilots will get a raise of at least 18% on the date the contract is signed, another 5% after one year, 4% after two years and 4% after three years, according to a draft contract seen by Reuters. They will also get a one-time payment equivalent to a cumulative 22% of their earnings between 2020 and 2022 after the deal is ratified. The Atlanta-based carrier\u2019s pilots have been working without a new contract for nearly three years after their old contract became amendable in December 2019, fueling frustration. They voted overwhelmingly in October to authorize a strike if negotiators could not reach an agreement on the new contract. The hefty pay raises are expected to further worsen cost pressures for carriers just as concerns over a US recession spark worries about consumer spending. Although ticket sales remain strong, investors fear travel demand could slip, making it harder for a debt-laden industry to repair its balance sheet. They fear carriers might be forced to borrow even more money to fund operations. A scramble, however, among carriers to staff up to capitalize on booming consumer demand has enhanced the bargaining power of pilots. With the industry returning to profitability, pilots argue airlines can pay them more to cover their increased costs of living. Airlines, thus far, have been relying on strong demand and higher fares to mitigate inflationary pressure. The demand for airline seats is still high compared to supply, meaning that customers are likely to continue to pay higher ticket prices. But if the United States falls into recession and that hits demand, it will be more difficult for airlines to cover those increased labor costs. In the draft agreement, Delta promises that pay rates for its pilots will exceed those at United and American by at least 1%. In a memo to its members, the union representing Delta pilots said the deal represents more than $7.2 billion of cumulative value increases over the next four years. Delta said it is \u201cpleased to have reached an agreement in principle for a new pilot contract, one that recognizes the contributions of our pilots to Delta\u2019s success.\u201d In a year of protests for the industry, pilots at all major US carriers have been demanding higher wages and a better work-life balance. Hundreds of United pilots picketed outside Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare airport on Thursday, asking for an \u201cindustry-leading\u201d contract. Last month, they turned down an offer that included more than 14.5% cumulative wage increases and enhanced overtime and training pay. American pilots also rejected a proposed 19% pay hike over two years that would have cost the Texas-based carrier about $2 billion. Pilots are also demanding a better quality of life. They say staffing and operational issues at carriers are driving up overtime, leaving them exhausted. In its memo, Delta\u2019s pilot union said more than 25% of the value of the contract agreement is dedicated to quality-of-life related items. The proposed deal also provides for 10 weeks of paid maternity leave, two weeks of paid parental leave and reduced health insurance premiums.",

            "title": "Air Force unveils newest stealth bomber aircraft",
            "text": "The Air Force on Friday unveiled its newest stealth bomber aircraft, the B-21 Raider, in Palmdale, California. Built by Northrop Grumman, the bomber was named in honor of the \u201ccourageous spirit\u201d of airmen who carried out the surprise World War II Doolittle Raid. The sixth-generation aircraft is expected to help the Air Force \u201cpenetrate the toughest defenses for precision strikes anywhere in the world,\u201d Northrop Grumman\u2019s press release said. Six bombers are currently in \u201cvarious stages of final assembly\u201d in California, according to the release.  The event on Friday was even more significant given that it marked the first time in more than 30 years a new US bomber has been publicly unveiled since the B-2 Spirit was presented in 1988. While the US originally planned to have a fleet of 132 B-2s, just 21 were ultimately purchased. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin touted the newest US stealth bomber in a speech Saturday at the Reagan National Defense Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. He called the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider a \u201cmajor advance for American deterrence\u201d and said it would be the backbone of the US bomber fleet in the future.  Austin, who attended the unveiling of the B-21 in Palmdale, said Saturday that the years ahead would be a \u201cdecisive decade\u201d as the US faces competition from China and the threat of Russia. The release of the new bomber comes amid heightened tensions between the US and both China and Russia. Just days ago, the Pentagon released its annual report on China, which said the country has doubled its number of nuclear warheads in a fraction of the time the US expected it to.  By 2035, the report said, China could have roughly 1,500 nuclear warheads \u2013 an \u201caccelerated expansion\u201d of its stockpile, a senior defense official told CNN. The next years, Austin said Saturday, \u201cwill determine whether our children and grandchildren inherit an open world of rules and rights \u2013 or face emboldened autocrats who seek to dominate by force and fear.\u201d The B-21 was designed with that competition in mind. Northrop Grumman\u2019s rundown of the new bomber\u2019s abilities said that while adversaries \u201ccontinue to invest in and develop advanced weapons,\u201d the B-21 will allow the US to penetrate enemy air defense and hit targets \u201canywhere in the world.\u201d  \u201cAmerica\u2019s defense will always be rooted in deterring conflict. So, we are again making it plain to any potential foe: the risk and the cost of aggression far outweigh any conceivable gains,\u201d Austin said at the Friday unveiling. \u201cThis is deterrence the American way.\u201d While Friday marked the \u201cfirst time the world\u2019s first sixth-generation aircraft (was) seen by the public,\u201d Northrop Grumman said, airmen and aircraft enthusiasts alike will have to wait until next year to actually see one in the air. The first B-21 flight is expected to happen in 2023, Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said, though she emphasized that the timing of the first flight \u201cwill be data and event, not date, driven.\u201d  The Air Force previously said that the new nuclear-capable stealth bomber, which has the ability to carry both nuclear and conventional weapons and which will fall under the Air Force\u2019s Global Strike Command, will be \u201cthe backbone of the future Air Force bomber force,\u201d designed in a way that is ripe for future modernization efforts.  The service named Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota, as the home of the B-21 and home to the aircraft\u2019s training program. Each aircraft was anticipated to cost $550 million when the price was set in 2010; after adjusting for inflation this year, Stefanek said, the cost of each aircraft, including training materials, support equipment and other components of the bomber, is $692 million. The Air Force plans to purchase at least 100 of the stealth bombers.  \u201cEven the most sophisticated air defense systems will struggle to detect the B-21 in the sky,\u201d Austin said at the unveiling.  The B-21 has been built with long-term sustainability and maintainability in mind, Northrop Grumman said in the release. It has also been designed to be rapidly upgraded when future threats demand it \u2013 a process that can often be slowed down by bureaucratic red tape and delayed timelines when it comes to older military aircraft and vehicles.  The bomber won\u2019t undergo \u201cblock upgrades,\u201d according to Northrop Grumman, which is a method of periodically upgrading parts of a system. Instead, the company said new \u201ctechnology, capabilities and weapons will be seamlessly incorporated\u201d through software upgrades.  \u201cThis will ensure the B-21 Raider can continuously meet the evolving threat head on for decades to come,\u201d the company said. Honoring the past The name \u201cRaider\u201d was submitted by airmen with the 337th Test and Evaluation Squadron out of Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, and beat out more than 2,000 other suggestions. It refers to the April 1942 Doolittle Raid, during which 80 airmen flew a retaliatory mission to bomb Japan just months after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Led by then-Lt. Col. James \u201cJimmy\u201d Doolittle, the airmen flew roughly 650 miles to Japan, bombing military installations, storage facilities and factories, according to the Air Force. But because of limited fuel, they knew it was unlikely they\u2019d make it back to safety as planned.  Instead, the pilots and crew \u201cditched at sea, bailed out, or crash-landed in China,\u201d according to the National Museum of the US Air Force, many reaching safety with the help of Chinese citizens. According to the museum, as many as a quarter of a million Chinese citizens were later executed by the Japanese as punishment for assisting the Americans.  Former Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James announced the new bomber\u2019s name in 2016 alongside one of the airmen who flew on that World War II mission, retired Lt. Col. Richard Cole, who died in 2019.  \u201cWe wanted [to] ensure the aircraft had a strong name airmen could take pride in, especially those who will have the opportunity to fly and maintain the B-21,\u201d Lt. Col. Jaime Hernandez, commander of the 337th, said in 2016. \u201cWe also wanted to take an element of our history into account, and the story of the Doolittle Raiders embodies just that.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

The King Salman International Airport, due to be built in capital Riyadh, will have no fewer than six parallel runways, allowing 185 million passengers to pass through annually by 2050. Built over the current King Khalid International Airport, it will sprawl over a whopping 22 square miles and is due to be designed by starchitects Foster + Partners, who have dubbed it an \u201caerotropolis.\u201d In fact, Saudi Arabia already has form in the art of the aerotropolis \u2013 it\u2019s already home to the largest airport in the world, King Fahd International Airport in Dammam, 250 miles northeast of Riyadh.   Luke Fox, Foster + Partners\u2019 head of studio, said the airport would \u201creimagine the traditional terminal as a single concourse loop, served by multiple entrances.\u201d The site will include over 4.5 square miles of retail outlets, \u201cresidential and recreational facilities,\u201d and logistics space.    By 2030, the airport wants to be carrying 120 million passengers a year, before increasing by 50% over the following two decades. It plans to also handle 3.5 million tons of cargo per year by 2050. Seif A. Bahaa Eldin, a senior partner at Foster + Partners, said in a statement that the aim is for the airport to help Riyadh itself become a \u201cglobal hub of creativity and innovation.\u201d It hopes to be sustainable \u2013 at least, as sustainable as a building serving the aviation industry can get \u2013 with renewable energy and a LEED Platinum certification (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) in the plans.  An outside-in feel with lots of glass walls will connect people inside the terminal to the great outdoors.   CNN\u2019s Richard Quest, who visited Saudi Arabia this year, wrote in September that \u201cSaudi is spending obscene sums of money creating new cities and tourist attractions\u201d as part of its tourism drive. \u201cI have seen countries change before, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anything quite like the change taking place in Saudi Arabia.

            "text": "Tesla made the first deliveries of its Semi truck to customers Thursday evening, five years after the heavy-duty hauler was first unveiled. The event included two truck cabs decked out in the livery of Pepsi and Frito-Lay, PepsiCo\u2019s snack foods subsidiary. The Tesla Semi was first shown as a prototype in 2017. At the time, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said production would begin in 2019. But Musk didn\u2019t say during Thursday night\u2019s presentation at Tesla\u2019s factory in Sparks, Nevada, how many trucks were actually being delivered to PepsiCo, or how many were being produced, or at what rate.  The fully electric semi truck features an unusual design in which the driver sits in the center of the cab rather than on one side. Tesla has boasted of the truck\u2019s performance \u2014 saying it accelerates much more quickly, even with a full load, than traditional diesel-powered semi trucks. A video during the presentation showed, according to Tesla, a fully loaded Tesla Semi accelerating up a steep grade and passing other trucks. Since it has no multi-geared transmission, as diesel trucks do, it\u2019s also much easier to drive than other semi trucks, Musk said. The truck can drive 500 miles on a single charge, according to Tesla. It has three electric motors, one of which drives the truck most of the time while the other two are used mostly for acceleration and hard pulling. The truck can pull up to 82,000 pounds, Tesla claims. Musk and Dan Priestley, Tesla\u2019s senior manager tor truck engineering, also boasted of new \u201cmegawatt\u201d ultra-fast chargers that will be used to quickly refill the truck\u2019s batteries, but they did not say how long it would take to recharge the truck. These chargers will be made available for the use of Cybertruck drivers when Tesla\u2019s pickup truck goes on sale, Musk said. Regenerative braking \u2014 the way electric vehicles use their motors to slow down and recharge their batteries using the vehicle\u2019s own motion \u2014 will also be a safety benefit, Priestley said, because drivers won\u2019t have to downshift going down long hills and may not need to use the truck\u2019s actual brakes at all. Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system, touted in the original presentation five years ago as a benefit for long haul truck drivers, wasn\u2019t mentioned during the presentation, however. Replacing gasoline and diesel-powered trucks with those that are electric could greatly improve human health and even save tens of thousands of lives, according to a recent report by the American Lung Association. Musk also talked about those benefits during the presentation plus the benefit of noise reduction for people living near highways. But making things a bit awkward between Tesla and PepsiCo, Musk recently tweeted about his appreciation for Coca-Cola products. Coke is Pepsi\u2019s most prominent competitor. Musk, who now runs Twitter as well as Tesla, published a photo of his bedside table showing, among other things, four open cans of Diet Coke. On Monday, he tweeted in response to someone else\u2019s post about Diet Coke products, writing \u201cDon\u2019t love the name, but the drink itself is amazing & brings me joy.\u201d When asked in the days before the presentation for its reaction to Musk\u2019s public displays of affection for Diet Coke, PepsiCo did not answer. Steven Williams, CEO of PepsiCo Foods North America, and Kirk Tanner, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America, appeared toward the end of the presentation and thanked Musk for allowing them to participate in the Semi truck program.",

            "title": "Airbus reveals plans for hydrogen fuel cell aircraft",
            "text": "Airbus has announced it is developing a hydrogen-powered fuel cell engine \u2013 and that it plans to test it on the largest commercial airplane ever to take to the skies.  The French aviation giant revealed at Airbus Summit 2022 on November 30 that it will mount the engine between the wings and the tail of a modified A380 superjumbo. Test flights are estimated for 2026, as part of the Airbus ZEROe initiative to launch a zero-emission aircraft by 2035.  \u201cIn terms of aerodynamics, the A380 is a very stable aircraft. So the pod attached to the rear fuselage via the stub doesn\u2019t pose much of an issue,\u201d said Mathias Andriamisaina, head of ZEROe demonstrators and tests at Airbus, in a statement. Airbus had previously revealed concept designs for an aircraft utilizing liquid hydrogen fuel and combustion engines, but vice president of Zero-Emission Aircraft Glenn Llewellyn suggested fuel cells alone might be sufficient to power smaller commercial aircraft. The engine uses fuel cells to convert the hydrogen into electricity, which then powers a propeller. \u201cAt scale, and if the technology targets were achieved, fuel cell engines may be able to power a 100-passenger aircraft with a range of approximately 1,000 nautical miles,\u201d he said.  The journey to decarbonize air travel Hydrogen has long been touted as a sustainable alternative to traditional jet fuel, either as a combustible fuel or used to generate electricity via fuel cells. The aviation industry produces 2.8% of global CO2 emissions but it faces harder challenges than other sectors in decarbonizing itself, and progress has been slow. While hydrogen-powered aircraft have been in development since the mid-20th Century, they have faced significant obstacles, mainly hydrogen\u2019s low energy density compared to kerosene, and the latter\u2019s availability and historically low price.  The infrastructure required to produce and distribute hydrogen is also an issue. At Airbus Summit, Airbus boss Guillaume Faury warned that this was \u201ca big concern\u201d and it could derail the company\u2019s plans to introduce a hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2035.  But hydrogen could become a key asset in commercial aviation even before entirely new aircraft based around it are developed. Days before Airbus\u2019 announcement, Rolls-Royce and budget airline EasyJet said they had successfully converted a regular airplane engine to run on liquid hydrogen fuel \u2014 a world first, they claim. The ground test involved a type of Rolls-Royce engine currently used in commercial and military airplanes, and a second test is already planned. Next, the trial will expand to a Rolls-Royce Pearl 15 engine, which is used to power Bombardier business jets capable of long-haul flight.  Future fuel The fuel for Rolls-Royce\u2019s test was sourced from wind and tidal energy, an example of \u201cgreen\u201d hydrogen.  Green hydrogen is commonly derived via the electrolysis of water \u2013 using electricity to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen \u2013 and using renewably sourced electricity to do so. \u201cGray\u201d hydrogen uses non-renewable electricity, while \u201cblue\u201d hydrogen is similar to gray, but captures most of the carbon emitted in production. Green hydrogen is considered the cleanest option.  How the hydrogen is utilized also creates a different footprint. Burning liquid hydrogen in the open-air releases a small amount of greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. Using green hydrogen to generate electricity in a fuel cell, however, emits only water and warm air.  The next decade will reveal which of the hydrogen technologies will take off. Either would be a positive step in securing the long-term viability of low-carbon air travel.",

            "text": "Walk around Doha and it isn\u2019t long before you hear people talking about Lionel Messi. Reminders of the superstar are everywhere at Qatar 2022; from posters in Metro stations to Argentina jerseys hanging up on market stalls.  Thousands of people \u2013 creating a sea of blue and white \u2013 have come to watch their hero in what is likely to be his last World Cup tournament. It seems you don\u2019t need to be from Argentina to be a fan of the seven-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner.  \u201cI get to see the man himself,\u201d Belal Ahmed, who has traveled from the US to watch Messi play, told CNN Sport.  \u201cIt took a while, the flight from the US to Saudi Arabia was about 12 hours. I had a layover there for 24 hours and then got here [Doha] two hours later.  \u201cI\u2019m here to see other games, but yeah, mainly to see Messi.\u201d  Ahmed was dressed head-to-toe in Argentina\u2019s colors as he spoke to CNN in Souq Waqif, an area of downtown Doha popular with fans.  He was one of many exploring the traditional marketplace wearing a Messi shirt, something which always attracts attention from fans of other teams.  Messi is a name that seems to bridge any language barrier, with fans coming over and chanting his name as Ahmed speaks to CNN.  READ: For Messi and Ronaldo, a final shot at World Cup glory The 23-year-old has traveled thousands of miles with his friends to watch his favorite player play live for the first time, and he spoke excitingly about what Messi means to him.   \u201cIt\u2019s his game. The skill speaks for itself,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what nation you\u2019re from, when you see that he\u2019s mastered the art of the sport itself. What\u2019s not to like about him? \u201cHe\u2019s a very humble man as well. His personality doesn\u2019t turn you off. Everything about him, especially his demeanor, is very attractive. \u201cBut it\u2019s mainly his skills on the field. If Messi was an average player and his personality is what it is, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d get that much attraction. I\u2019m just so excited to see him play.\u201d   Messi is undoubtedly the most popular player among fans in Doha, with everyone trying to find a ticket to watch him in the flesh.  After a disappointing start to this year\u2019s World Cup against Saudi Arabia, Messi showed his brilliance against Mexico with a scintillating goal to inspire his side to victory.  He must now do it again against Poland in his team\u2019s final Group C game on Wednesday to ensure progression into the knockout stages.  The World Cup is the only trophy not yet in Messi\u2019s cabinet, and the 35-year-old is in the last chance saloon at Qatar 2022.  \u201cI think to solidify his GOAT [Greatest Of All Time] status he needs the World Cup,\u201d Ahmed added.  \u201cI\u2019d say he\u2019s the GOAT already, but for everyone to be on the same boat, he\u2019s going to need that World Cup.\u201d Messi in Qatar Messi\u2019s presence around Doha doesn\u2019t only demonstrate the superstar\u2019s pulling power, but also reinforces his current club Paris-Saint Germain\u2019s links to Qatar. The French side is owned by the Qatar Sports Investment group and posters of its star players, such as Neymar and Messi, are plastered all around the city.  The Argentine is also used in adverts shown on big screens inside stadiums ahead of every game at Qatar 2022 and his name is cheered by fans in bars and restaurants.  \u201cI think the football Messi plays is mesmerizing. You can\u2019t compare him, he\u2019s beyond comparison,\u201d Ratish Ravindran, who is from the UK but was wearing an Argentina shirt, told CNN. Ravindran had not managed to get his hands on a ticket to watch Argentina play, but he still wanted to be in the city to support his hero.  He\u2019s enjoyed watching matches on the big screens dotted around Doha and celebrating Messi with the thousands of other fans around the city.  \u201cThe amount he\u2019s won already in his career, it\u2019s great. For me, he\u2019s the best player in the world,\u201d Ravindran added.  Argentina certainly seems to be the neutrals\u2019 favorite team in Qatar and all its fans, from across the world, will be hoping to see more Messi magic as the tournament progresses. ",

            "title": "A new airline is planning low-cost transatlantic flights",
            "text": "Hot on the heels of Norwegian, WOW and Play, a new low-cost airline is promising to bring back budget transatlantic flights. Fly Atlantic this week announced plans to start operating in 2024. The new budget airline will be based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. As well as operating short-haul European flights, it plans to enter the transatlantic market with low-cost flights from Belfast to the US and Canada. Of course, its main problem will be that the transatlantic airline market is notoriously difficult to turn a profit. Of the trio it seeks to emulate, two failed to make low-cost transatlantic flights work. Norwegian killed off its long-haul routes during the pandemic, while Wow Air went bankrupt in 2019. The transatlantic route graveyard also includes Primera Air, La Compagnie\u2019s UK-US business class route, and even British Airways, which failed to resurrect its all business class flights from London City Airport to New York post-pandemic. The transatlantic low-cost market is so difficult that in 2020, Icelandic artist Oddur Eysteinn Fri\u00f0riksson even created a fake airline, MOM Air, as an art installation. MOM Air received 6,000 booking requests for its mooted Europe-US network in the two weeks before the artist confirmed it was a hoax.    Fly Atlantic plans to fly to 35 destinations from its Belfast base, with tickets going on sale in early 2024. It hopes to corner the market in low-cost connections between Europe and the US and Canada.   It\u2019ll start with a small fleet of six aircraft \u2013 likely to be Airbus A321s or the Boeing 737 MAX, with the airline saying it is currently in talks with both manufacturers. It plans to expand to 18 aircraft within the first four years. At the moment, there are no direct transatlantic flights from Belfast. Dublin, in the Republic of Ireland, is a popular departure point to the US, thanks to facilities at Dublin and Shannon airports that allow travelers to clear US border control before taking off. But as Northern Ireland is part of the UK, it looks unlikely that this would be a possibility \u2013 the preclearance facility is currently only available in six countries worldwide, of which Ireland is one.  Andrew Pyne, Fly Atlantic CEO, said in a statement that the airline has a \u201cvision\u2026 of Belfast as a strong aviation hub linking Europe and North America\u201d and promised to offer affordable fares with brand new aircraft.\u201d He added: \u201cWe looked at many options throughout the UK and Ireland. Belfast International and Vinci stood out in terms of the facilities that they offered us and by their enthusiasm for and commitment to making this project a reality. Northern Ireland has a proud aviation and engineering history, and we are delighted to be able to build on this tradition as we develop the airline and its support functions.\u201d The airline already has offices at the airport, and hopes to create 1,000 jobs.

            "text": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway is continuing to unwind its long position in BYD, China\u2019s largest home-grown EV maker and Tesla\u2019s major rival, after holding it for 14 years. The legendary investor\u2019s conglomerate sold another 3.2 million Hong Kong-listed shares of BYD\n            \n                (BYDDF) last week, cutting its stake to 15.99%, a Hong Kong stock exchange filing showed Tuesday. The sale was valued at about $80 million.  It\u2019s the fifth major share sale by Berkshire\n            \n                (BERK) of BYD shares disclosed since August, according to public records. The pace of sales increased significantly this month, with three transactions so far in November. Berkshire has not disclosed the reason for the sales. The company didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment by CNN Business. Before the first deal was disclosed in August, Berkshire had held 225 million shares of BYD for 14 years.   The US conglomerate first bought BYD shares at an average of HK$8 ($1.02) apiece in 2008, with an investment of $230 million. Back then, BYD shares had fallen to a record low during the global financial crisis. But the stock has rebounded sharply since then. In 2020, BYD\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares soared 437% as the company developed its \u201cBlade Battery\u201d and China\u2019s EV market boomed.  The company says the blade-shaped battery is thinner and longer than conventional lithium iron cells. As a result, it can maximize the use of available space within the battery pack. It\u2019s also less likely to catch fire even when it\u2019s severely damaged, according to BYD. BYD has already surpassed Tesla to become China\u2019s best-selling EV brand. Last month, it sold 103,157 pure electric vehicles in China. In comparison, Tesla delivered 71,704 vehicles from its China factory, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association.  In late June, BYD\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares hit a record high of HK$331.4 ($42). That was about 41 times the price Berkshire paid 14 years ago. Since the summer, Berkshire has been on a BYD stock-selling spree. Based on the latest exchange filing, the conglomerate has dumped more than 49 million BYD shares in the past four months. It\u2019s not clear how much Berkshire has profited from the sale. But the average price of each share in the five deals disclosed by the company since August was around HK$205 ($26). Using that average, Berkshire might have bagged a net profit of $1.2 billion by offloading the 49 million shares, assuming a purchase price of HK$8, according to a calculation by CNN Business. The conglomerate\u2019s current stake in BYD is worth $3.9 billion, based on the latest stock price.",

            "text": "In a surprise reversal, Qatar announced a ban of alcoholic beer at the eight stadiums hosting the World Cup. That leaves fans with just one \u201cbeer\u201d choice \u2014 albeit one that isn\u2019t boozy. Soccer fans will still be able to purchase Bud Zero, an alcohol-free lager that Anheuser-Busch says tastes similar to its best-selling alcoholic beverage.  One serving of Bud Zero has 0 grams of sugar and 50 calories. The beer, which is Bud\u2019s first ever zero alcohol beer, launched in the United States two years ago, targeting a growing trend of people choosing non-alcoholic beers. Non-alcoholic alternatives to booze have been around for a while, but the sector has been booming lately. The non-alcoholic trend started to pick up a year or two before the pandemic and has continued to grow at a rapid clip. Demand for non-alcoholic alternatives has been largely driven by younger consumers. Qatar is a Muslim country that is considered to be very conservative, and tightly regulates alcohol sales and usage. In September, officials said ticketed fans would be able to buy alcoholic beer three hours before kickoff and for one hour after the final whistle, but not during the match. \u201cFollowing discussions between host country authorities and FIFA, a decision has been made to focus the sale of alcoholic beverages on the FIFA Fan Festival, other fan destinations and licensed venues, removing sales points of beer from Qatar\u2019s FIFA World Cup 2022 stadium perimeter,\u201d said FIFA, soccer\u2019s governing body, in a statement Friday.  FIFA noted that the decision will have \u201cno impact\u201d on sales of Bud Zero. Budweiser tweeted, \u201cWell, this is awkward,\u201d though the social media post was quickly deleted. \u201cAs partners of FIFA for over three decades, we look forward to our activations of FIFA World Cup campaigns around the world to celebrate football with our consumers,\u201d an Anheuser-Busch InBev spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cSome of the planned stadium activations cannot move forward due to circumstances beyond our control.\u201d It is indeed slightly awkward for AB InBev, which is a major sponsor of the World Cup, and was planning to selling regular Bud. Just a few days ago, reports showed World Cup workers moving beer tents into less visible areas of stadiums. AB InBev paid $75 million for the sponsorship, according to multiple reports. So, the decision throws a bit of a wrench into their marketing plans since the decision dramatically reduces its presence for thousands of fans at the World Cup. However, arguably the bigger part \u2014 its TV advertisements with football royalty Lionel Messi and Neymar Jr. \u2014 won\u2019t be affected.  \u201cQatar\u2019s decision to ban all alcohol around the grounds for the upcoming FIFA World Cup just days before it begins presents an illusion that FIFA is not in control of its own tournament and risks alienating Budweiser\u2014a key sponsor and long-term partner of the governing body,\u201d said Conrad Wiacek, head of sport analysis at GlobalData, in an email. The decision could have ramifications for the future, Wiacek said, noting that Budweiser\u2019s partnership with the World Cup expires after this year\u2019s event.  \u201cHowever, Budweiser will be cautious to burn its bridges with the governing body, as the 2026 US tournament will be highly prized. Going elsewhere would open up opportunity for other alcohol brands in its wake,\u201d he said. The FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 kicks off Sunday and lasts until December 18.",

Budweiser pays around $75 million for its sponsorship agreement with FIFA, according to the New York Times. \u201cAs partners of FIFA for over three decades, we look forward to our activations of FIFA World Cup\u2122 campaigns around the world to celebrate football with our consumers,\u201d said an AB InBev spokesperson. \u201cSome of the planned stadium activations cannot move forward due to circumstances beyond our control.\u201d  The Football Supporters\u2019 Association (FSA), the national representative body for football fans in England and Wales, has condemned the decision on beer sales. In a statement released on Friday, the FSA said: \u201cSome fans like a beer at the match, and some don\u2019t, but the real issue is the last minute U-turn which is speaks to a wider problem \u2013 the total lack of communications and clarity from the organising committee towards the supporters. \u201cIf they can change their minds on this at a moment\u2019s notice, with no explanation, supporters will have understandable concerns about whether they will fulfill other promises relating to accommodation, transport or cultural issues.\u201d Fans will not be the only ones disappointed with the eleventh-hour U-turn.  Ben Peppi, head of sports services at JMW Solicitors, says the move is \u201chugely damaging\u201d for FIFA\u2019s brand. \u201cBrands will be treading very carefully now around FIFA for future tournaments,\u201d he told CNN Sport. \u201cBecause if two days out before the biggest global sporting event that they host, they turn round to a brand and say, \u2018you can\u2019t do this and you can\u2019t do that\u2019 and breach that contract, that\u2019s not going to give any security to any new brand.\u201d  The 2022 Qatar World Cup runs from November 20 until December 18. CNN is still waiting for an official statement from Qatar\u2019s Supreme Committee.",

Skyroot Aerospace was launched in 2018 and is based in the southern tech hub of Hyderabad. It was founded by former ISRO engineers and has raised $68 million in funding, according to data firm Tracxn.  Last year, it became the first startup to enter into an agreement with ISRO to use the Indian space agency\u2019s expertise and to access facilities.

            "title": "Jeff Bezos\u2019 top tips for managing the economic downturn",
            "text": "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos recently warned consumers and businesses they should consider postponing large purchases in the coming months as the global economy contends with a downturn and faces a possible recession.  The business leader offered his starkest advice yet on a faltering economy in an exclusive sit-down interview with CNN\u2019s Chloe Melas on Saturday at Bezos\u2019 Washington, DC, home. Bezos urged people to put off expenditures for big-ticket items such as new cars, televisions and appliances, noting that delaying big purchases is the surest way to keep some \u201cdry powder\u201d in the event of a prolonged economic downturn. Meanwhile, small businesses may want to avoid making large capital expenditures or acquisitions during this uncertain time, Bezos added. If enough consumers follow through with Bezos\u2019 advice, it could mean lower sales for Amazon, the e-commerce giant Bezos founded and that created the vast majority of the billionaire\u2019s wealth.  The New York Times reported Monday that Amazon plans to slash its workforce, laying off 10,000 workers, the largest reduction in the company\u2019s history. That\u2019s in addition to a previously announced hiring freeze in its corporate workforce. The company is second only to Walmart in the number of people it employs in the United States. Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN) said in October it expects sales for the final three months of the year to be significantly below Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The weaker forecast came as rising inflation and looming recession fears weigh on consumer purchasing decisions as Americans focus more on travel and dining out and less on buying discretionary goods. The company\u2019s stock has fallen more than 40% as surging prices and changing customer behavior weigh on Amazon and the broader tech sector. Bezos said the probability of economic conditions worsening makes it prudent to save some cash if it\u2019s an option. \u201cTake some risk off the table,\u201d he said. \u201cJust a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference.\u201d Last month, Bezos tweeted a warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they \u201cbatten down the hatches.\u201d The advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview. Many may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream \u201cis and will be even more attainable in the future\u201d \u2014 projecting that within his own lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public. Although the US economy is not, technically, in a recession, nearly 75% of likely voters in a recent CNN poll said they feel as though it is. Wages are up, but not enough to take the sting off inflation, most notably high prices of necessities like food, fuel and shelter. For those invested in stocks, it\u2019s not been a great year, either, and that\u2019s especially hard on retirees who are living off their investments. Other business leaders have issued similar messages about the economy in recent months. Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) and Twitter CEO Elon Musk last month admitted demand for Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA)s was \u201ca little harder\u201d to come by, and noted that Europe and China are experiencing a \u201crecession of sorts.\u201d Musk also warned that Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) would fall short of its sales growth target. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in October spooked the stock market by saying a recession could hit the United States in as little as six to nine months.",

In a filing with the United States\u2019 Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKA) said it acquired about 60 million American depository shares of TSMC\n            \n                (TSM) in the three months ended September.  Shares of TSMC were up over 8% in Taiwan on Tuesday.  \u201cTSMC welcomes all investors with the propensity to buy and hold TSMC\u2019s stock,\u201d a spokesperson for the chipmaker said.  TSMC accounts for an estimated 90% of the world\u2019s super-advanced computer chips, supplying tech giants including Apple\n            \n                (AAPL) and Qualcomm\n            \n                (QCOM).  Berkshire\u2019s purchase of a stake in the Taiwanese chip giant comes as tensions between China and the self-governed democratic island are escalating.  Taiwan has been facing growing military aggression from Beijing in recent months, and that has thrown a spotlight on the critical role it plays in the global chipmaking industry.  Super-advanced semiconductor chips \u2014 like the ones produced by TSMC \u2014 are difficult to make because of the high cost of development and the level of knowledge required, meaning much of the production is concentrated in just a handful of suppliers.  The firm \u2014 widely dubbed in Taiwan as its \u201csacred mountain\u201d \u2014 is so important to the island that its employees can apply to be exempted from military reservist training, the defense ministry has said. Tensions between Washington and Beijing have also been rising lately over chips, with President Joe Biden imposing a sweeping set of controls on the sale of advanced chips and chip-making equipment to Chinese firms. Experts fear that these controls could shift the tech arms race between the United States and China to a whole new level. Berkshire also owns large stakes in Apple, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, Chevron, and American Express. \u2014 Eric Cheung contributed to this report.",

            "text": "Amazon is planning to lay off some 10,000 employees in corporate and technology jobs, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing anonymous sources with knowledge of the matter. The job cuts could start as early as this week, and will likely include staff working on Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN) devices (such as its voice-assistant Alexa), as well as people in its retail and human resources divisions, according to the report. \u201cThe total number of layoffs remains fluid,\u201d the report stated.  Amazon did not immediately respond to CNN Business\u2019 request for comment Monday. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the report. The Wall Street Journal also reported Monday that Amazon is set to lay off thousands of workers, citing a person familiar with the matter.  The news would make Amazon the latest in a spate of tech companies that have announced significant layoffs in recent weeks, amid broader economic uncertainty and a sharp slowdown in the demand many tech giants saw during the pandemic that led them to quickly add staff. Last week, Facebook-parent Meta announced it is laying off 11,000 employees. Earlier this month, Amazon said it was freezing corporate hiring \u201cfor the next few months,\u201d citing economic uncertainty and \u201chow many people we have hired\u201d in recent years. Amazon rapidly grew its headcount as the pandemic shifted consumer habits and spending towards e-commerce. In its most-recent earnings report, however, Amazon forecast its revenue for the holiday quarter would be lighter than analysts had expected.  Shares in Amazon have fallen more than 40% in 2022 so far amid a broader market decline.  News of potential layoffs comes at a crucial time for the retail industry, ahead of the holiday shopping season. Despite recession fears and inflationary pressures, the National Retail Federation is predicting a 6% to 8% sales increase from last year during the holiday shopping months.  Last month, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos tweeted about the possibility of a looming recession, writing, \u201cthe probabilities in this economy tell you to batten down the hatches.\u201d In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chloe Melas on Saturday, Bezos said that advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike. \u201cTake some risk off the table,\u201d he said. \u201cJust a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference.\u201d",

            "text": "The great bull run for tech stocks may finally be over.  It has been a brutal year for the leading companies of Silicon Valley. Apple\u2019s\n            \n                (AAPL) stock is down about 16% in 2022 \u2014 and that makes it the \u201cbest\u201d performer of the so-called FAANGs of Big Tech. Facebook owner Meta, Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN), Netflix\n            \n                (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet\n            \n                (GOOGL) have all done far worse, with Meta plunging 66% this year.  Other titans of the Nasdaq, such as Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT), chip giant Nvidia\n            \n                (NVDA) and Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) have fallen between 25% and 45% in 2022 as well. (The Nasdaq itself is down nearly 30%.) The tech sector has been a market leader for years, but there are growing concerns about the future. Recent earnings have not been great. Economic downturn would hurt tech Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi, noted in a report late last week that tech earnings during the third quarter fell 1% from a year ago and that revisions for the fourth quarter have been cut by nearly 10% in recent weeks. It could get worse. \u201cWith this being the first quarter of a meaningful tone change in earnings \u2026 I don\u2019t think it will be the last one of margin pressure,\u201d Young wrote. She added that \u201cit\u2019s becoming clear that we may at least see recessionary conditions in some sectors, even if they don\u2019t bleed into all facets of the economy. Tech is one of those sectors.\u201d  There are also legitimate questions about strategy shifts at some companies. Meta, for example, is going all in on augmented and virtual reality while Netflix is now embracing advertising after years of vowing it would not have ads on its platforms.  Broader worries about the economy and advertising spending are hurting the sector. Many of the tech giants have already announced layoffs, and there is speculation that there could be more job cuts coming. Recession worries don\u2019t bode well for consumer spending, which is bad for Amazon and Apple in particular. And the tech leaders all face tougher competition \u2014 in some cases from one another \u2014 but also from rivals around the globe. With that in mind, this could be just the beginning of a tech bear market.  Todd Sohn, director and technical strategist at Strategas, noted in a report late last week that when tech stocks imploded in 2000 as the dot-com bubble burst, it wasn\u2019t until after the 2008 financial crisis before tech resumed a role as a market leader.  Sohn said tech could be in for another long winter ahead, noting that it\u2019s \u201creasonable to expect that tech could take a backseat over the next couple of years, while energy, industrials, etc. assume the same type of leadership role that they took after the tech bubble.\u201d  Some pockets of opportunity Still, some argue that tech will bounce back in 2023. But investors may need to look beyond the FAANGs, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla and other megacaps. \u201cTech is not a monolith. We believe cybersecurity and robotics have the potential to buck the economic cycle given cybersecurity has moved from niche to necessity and robots are mission-critical in fighting supply chain challenges, labor shortages and inflation,\u201d Jay Jacobs, US head of thematics and active equity ETFs, said in a report. BlackRock\n            \n                (BLK), the owner of the popular iShares family of ETFs, recommends several of its own sector funds as a way to play these trends, including the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech\n            \n                (IHAK), iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence\n            \n                (IRBO), BlackRock\n            \n                (BLK) Future Tech, iShares Evolved U.S. Technolog\n            \n                (IETC)y and iShares Semiconductor ETFs.  Shawn Cruz, head trading strategist at Charles Schwab\n            \n                (SCHW)-owned TD Ameritrade, said tech investors are flocking more to cybersecurity since it\u2019s a must have for corporations, regardless of economic conditions, given high profile hacking incidents. Cruz said that there are some parts of tech that are trading at more \u201cfrothy\u201d valuations. But cybersecurity stocks such as Palo Alto Networks\n            \n                (PANW), as well as semiconductors, are more reasonable.  In other words, tech investors should be looking tor more boring parts of the sector, not assets like crypto that are more about hype than substance. Cruz said that winners in tech are not going to be those with the next great idea or app. It\u2019s about providing a service that businesses will need even if the economy slides into a recession.",

Authorities responded to the incident at Dallas Executive Airport, Jason Evans with Dallas Fire-Rescue told CNN on Saturday. The number of casualties in the crash was still not confirmed later on Saturday afternoon, according to Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson.  However, the Allied Pilots Association, the labor union representing American Airlines pilots, identified two pilot retirees and former union members among those killed in the collision. Former members Terry Barker and Len Root were among the crew members on the B-17 Flying Fortress during the Wings Over Dallas airshow, the APA said in a tweet. The APA is also offering professional counseling services at their headquarters in Fort Worth following the incident. \u201cOur hearts go out to their families, friends, and colleagues past and present,\u201d their tweet said. There were more than 40 fire rescue units on scene after the collision, the agency\u2019s active incidents page shows.  In a Saturday afternoon news conference, Hank Coates, president and CEO of the Commemorative Air Force, told reporters the B-17 \u201cnormally has a crew of four to five. That was what was on the aircraft,\u201d while the P-63 is a \u201csingle-piloted fighter type aircraft.\u201d \u201cI can tell you that it was normally crewed,\u201d Coates said. \u201cI cannot release the number of people in the manifest or the names on the manifest until I\u2019m released to do so by the NTSB.\u201d The Commemorative Air Force identified both aircraft as being out of Houston. \u201cCurrently we do not have information on the status of the flight crews as emergency responders are working the accident,\u201d a statement from the group said, adding it is working with local authorities and the FAA. The FAA is currently leading the investigation, which is set to be turned over to the NTSB at approximately 9 p.m. when the NTSB team arrives at the scene, Coates said. On Saturday evening, the NTSB said it is launching a go-team to investigate the collision. The team is expected to arrive on Sunday, the NTSB said in a tweet. \u201cMember Michael Graham will serve as spokesperson on scene,\u201d the tweet added. \u201cThe maneuvers that they [the aircraft] were going through were not dynamic at all,\u201d Coates noted. \u201cIt was what we call \u2018Bombers on Parade\u2019.\u201d Johnson tweeted later on Saturday no spectators or others on the ground were reported injured, although the debris field from the collision includes the Dallas Executive Airport grounds, Highway 67, and a nearby strip mall. The event, which was scheduled to run through Sunday, has been canceled, according to the organizer\u2019s website. Johnson said in a tweet after the crash, \u201cAs many of you have now seen, we have had a terrible tragedy in our city today during an airshow. Many details remain unknown or unconfirmed at this time.\u201d \u201cThe videos are heartbreaking. Please, say a prayer for the souls who took to the sky to entertain and educate our families today,\u201d Johnson said in a separate tweet. Southbound and northbound lanes of the highway were shut down after the incident, the Dallas Police Department said. \u201cThis is not about the aircraft. It\u2019s just not,\u201d Coates said during the news conference. \u201cI can tell you the aircraft are great aircraft, they\u2019re safe. They\u2019re very well-maintained. The pilots are very well-trained. So it\u2019s difficult for me to talk about it, because I know all these people, these are family, and they\u2019re good friends.\u201d According to Coates, the individuals flying the aircraft in CAF airshows are volunteers and have a strict process of training. Many of them are airline pilots, retired airline pilots, or retired military pilots, Coates said. Rare vintage aircraft destroyed The B-17 was part of the collection of the Commemorative Air Force, nicknamed \u201cTexas Raiders,\u201d and had been hangered in Conroe, Texas near Houston. It was one of about 45 complete surviving examples of the model, only nine of which were airworthy. The P-63 was even rarer. Some 14 examples are known to survive, four of which in the United States were airworthy, including one owned by the Commemorative Air Force. More than 12,000 B-17s were produced by Boeing, Douglas Aircraft and Lockheed between 1936 and 1945, with nearly 5,000 lost during the war, and most of the rest scrapped by the early 1960s. About 3,300 P-63\u2019s were produced by Bell Aircraft between 1943 and 1945, and were principally used by the Soviet Air Force in World War II.",

            "text": "A faulty automatic engine throttle system that was not properly monitored by pilots led to a deadly January 2021 crash of a Sriwijaya 737-500 jet, Indonesia\u2019s air accident investigator KNKT said in a final report on Thursday. The crash into the Java Sea after take-off from Jakarta, which killed all 62 people on board, was Indonesia\u2019s third major commercial plane crash in just over six years and shone a spotlight on its poor air safety record.  Problems with the autothrottle system that automatically controls engine power had been reported 65 times in the 26-year-old jet\u2019s maintenance logs since 2013 and were still unresolved before the accident, the agency said in its 202-page report. A working autothrottle is not required for a plane to be dispatched because pilots can control the thrust levers manually. However, KNKT said in this case they did not appear to have closely monitored the asymmetrical thrust situation involving the left engine throttle lever moving back to as low as 34% speed after takeoff while the right lever stayed in its original climb setting at about 92%.  \u201cThere were several indications available that the pilots could have checked to identify the aircraft anomalies, such as engine parameters, thrust levers position, and roll angle,\u201d the agency said, adding that complacency and confirmation bias may have been a factor in the poor monitoring. Sriwijaya did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Boeing, the manufacturer of the 737-500 jet, declined to comment. At about 10,700 feet, the autopilot disengaged and the plane rolled to the left more than 45 degrees and started its dive into the sea. The first officer said \u201cupset, upset\u201d and \u201ccaptain, captain\u201d before the recording stopped, but the captain\u2019s channel was not working, making it more difficult for investigators to analyze events. An upset situation involves an aircraft operating outside normal flying parameters like speed, angle or altitude. KNKT Chief Investigator Nurcahyo Utomo told reporters there had been no regulations and guidelines on upset prevention training by Indonesian airlines that ensured a pilot\u2019s ability to stop unwanted situations from occurring, with a key part of that being monitoring. Sriwijaya has since carried out such training for its pilots, he said. KNKT had raised the lack of upset recovery training after the 2014 crash of an AirAsia Indonesia jet that killed all 162 people on board. Upset recovery training was then mandated in Indonesia in 2017, according to the final report, but Utomo said the aviation regulator did not update the requirement after the UN aviation body ICAO said in 2018 the course should also include upset prevention. Indonesia is putting in place updated upset prevention and recovery training, KNKT said in the report.",

            "text": "For avgeeks, the destruction of the world\u2019s largest commercial plane was one of the key images at the start of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In February, the Antonov AN-225 was attacked at its base in Hostomel, near Kyiv. \u201cThe dream will never die,\u201d tweeted the manufacturers when it was destroyed. Now it looks like they have stayed true to their word, with the company announcing that plans to rebuild it are already underway. Nicknamed \u201cMriya\u201d \u2013 Ukrainian for \u201cdream\u201d \u2013 the massive plane was built in the 1980s to carry the Soviet space shuttle. Its later life, while slightly less glamorous, was equally iconic \u2013 it was the world\u2019s largest cargo transporter, with around twice the hold capacity as a Boeing 747, winning cult status among self-styled avgeeks. It stretched to 84 meters, or 275 feet, with the longest wingspan of any fully operational airplane. To date, it is the heaviest aircraft ever built.      Its destruction was announced on February 27 2022, with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeting that \u201cRussia may have destroyed our \u2018Mriya\u2019\u2026 but they will never be able to destroy our dream of a strong, free and democratic European state.\u201d    The Antonov Company said at the time that it was unable to verify the condition of the plane, while CNN journalist Vasco Cotovio noted that the nose had apparently taken \u201ca direct artillery hit\u201d and was \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d when he saw it on an April visit.  \u201cThere was extensive damage to the wings and some of the engines. The tail end section was spared from any large impacts and has a few holes caused by either shrapnel or bullets,\u201d he said at the time, predicting that a repair would be unlikely.  On Monday, however, the Antonov Company announced in a tweet that the rebuild project had already begun, with \u201cdesign work\u201d already in the offing. While it had estimated repair costs, the company predicted a bill of over  \u20ac500 million ($502 million) to get it back in the air, promising more information \u201cafter the victory.\u201d Already the company has around 30% of the components needed to build a new one, it announced. Originally, Ukrainian state defense company Ukroboronprom, which manages Antonov, had issued a statement estimating the restoration at over $3 billion \u2013 which it vowed to make Russia pay. The rebuild would take at least five years, it said at the time.   Antonov subsequently confirmed to CNN that it was working on the project.   \u201cThe process of rebuilding \u2018Mriya\u2019 is considered as an international project, with the participation of aviation enterprises of different countries of the world,\u201d it said via email.   \u201cThe possibility of attracting funding from various sources is being considered and proposals from many organizations that are ready to join the project are being reviewed.\u201d The company said it would coordinate the research, design and assembly, and confirmed that there are still main airframe units for a new plane that have not been destroyed.  \u201cThe program is developing in the direction of carrying out an expert assessment of these units, for subsequent calculations and design works,\u201d it wrote, adding that the build would take place \u201cimmediately after the victory of Ukraine.\u201d The announcement coincides with the launch of an exhibition dedicated to the plane at Leipzig/Halle Airport in Germany, which is home to five other Antonov aircraft. \u201cLight and shadow: The Antonov story\u201d shows photos of the aircraft before and after its destruction, focusing on the engineering prowess that was lost when it was attacked. It will be on display until the end of December. At the opening, Oleksiy Makeiev, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to Germany, announced that although he\u2019d flown on \u201calmost all AN aircraft, the Mriya remained a dream for me,\u201d in a statement released by the company.  \u201cWe hope that it will be restored and we will see this mighty bird in the sky again,\u201d he added.   In the meantime, if you\u2019re missing Mriya, you can build your own \u2013 or, at least, your own model. Ukrainian startup Metal Time is selling working mechanical design kits of the AN-225. Each cost $99, and profits go straight to Antonov to fund the Mriya rebuild, as well as the rehousing of Antonov employees whose homes have been destroyed by the Russian invasion, and training for new Ukrainian pilots and aviation engineers.

            "text": "In 2019, Air Company made a splash when it launched vodka derived from recaptured carbon, in an effort to reduce the amount of the harmful greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.   Today, the Brooklyn-based startup has begun using the same process to make fuel for airplanes.   Air Company\u2019s sustainable aviation fuel, which was recently tested by the US Air Force, could ultimately help the airline industry hit its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Currently, the airline industry accounts for about 3% of total global carbon emissions each year, and mostly relies on traditional, fossil-based fuels that require various forms of environmental disruption to produce.   Already, some of the world\u2019s biggest airlines are signing on to Air Company\u2019s vision. The company announced last month that Jet Blue and Virgin Atlantic, as well as startup aircraft company Boom Supersonic, have agreed to purchase millions of gallons of its fuel in the coming years. Jet Blue Ventures, the airline\u2019s investment arm, also invested directly in Air Company\u2019s $30 million Series A funding round earlier this year.  \u201cHow we think about what the company does is trying to solve humanity\u2019s toughest problems,\u201d Gregory Constantine, co-founder and CEO of Air Company, told CNN in an interview last month. \u201cFor us, climate change is the greatest challenge that we\u2019re facing as humanity to date \u2026 so if we can work on technologies that take what was once really thought of as a problem and turn it into a solution, then that\u2019s a massive win.\u201d  A number of producers of sustainable aviation fuel have emerged in recent years, including a major Finnish producer called Neste, many of them using ingredients such as plant material and cooking oil. But Air Company\u2019s production process starts by pulling harmful carbon emissions out of the air.   The company first harvests carbon, mostly from industrial settings such as biofuel production facilities. It then takes water, separates the hydrogen from the oxygen, and blends the captured carbon with the hydrogen and a proprietary mix of other compounds, according to Air Company CTO Stafford Sheehan. It then distills that solution down, using what looks like a larger version of, say, a whiskey distilling system. The final products are ethyl alcohol, which is used to make the company\u2019s vodka and other products such as perfume, as well as paraffin, which forms the basis of its jet fuel.  In some ways, Sheehan said, the process mimics how plants work: It takes in carbon, and aside from the final products, the only other offput is oxygen. And the company says its tests have indicated that planes should be able to fly using its fuel without blending it with fossil-based fuels or modifying their engines.   By the time a plane has flown using Air Company\u2019s fuel, it will have released the same amount of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere as was captured to make the fuel, meaning the process on the whole is carbon-neutral, Sheehan said. The company uses renewable energy sources like solar to power its production facility.   Air Company does still have some work to do until its carbon-derived fuel is ready to be used widely on commercial flights. It needs more testing, and it needs to grow its manufacturing footprint. Sheehan said the company\u2019s next production facility is already in the works and will be about 100 times the size of its Brooklyn test facility, which is probably about the size of a two-bedroom New York City apartment.   The company will also need to bring down the cost of its fuel, which is currently more expensive than traditional jet fuels, although the company declined to provide details on just how much. Air Company said that \u201cconsumers will not feel the impact of this shift,\u201d and added that lowering the cost will be achieved in part \u201cthrough an array of government incentives made available to fuel producers generating sustainable alternatives.\u201d  Constantine said the company is planning for the first test of its fuel on a commercial plane next year, and expects to have its fuel used on its first commercial passenger flight by 2024.  Still, Air Company is hopeful that its efforts could eventually disrupt the aviation industry for the better, just as it\u2019s been working to do with its consumer goods.   \u201cAviation has been a part of the goal since the start,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, to get to those, you know, large industrial markets like aviation fuel, which it is traditionally known as the hottest industry industries to decarbonize, is going to take time. It\u2019s going to take a lot of money and a lot of effort.\u201d ",

            "title": "Elon Musk sold nearly $4 billion worth of Tesla stock since Twitter deal closed",
            "text": "Elon Musk sold $3.95 billion worth of Tesla stock since completing his purchase of Twitter late last month. Musk\u2019s Tesla stock sales, totaling 19.5 million shares, have been widely anticipated ever since the Tesla CEO reached a deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion. Musk had sold blocks of Tesla shares worth a total of $15.4 billion earlier this year since his deal to buy Twitter was announced. Twitter confirmed Musk bought the social media company October 27, but he waited until November 4 to start selling additional Tesla shares. He also sold blocks of Tesla stock on Monday and Tuesday this week, according to filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission late Tuesday night.  It\u2019s not clear if the money Musk raised went toward the Twitter purchase, or to support losses at Twitter since he took over.  Musk disclosed last week that Twitter has seen a \u201cmassive drop in revenue,\u201d as a growing number of advertisers pause spending on the platform in the wake of his takeover of the company. He blamed \u201cactivist groups\u201d pressuring advertisers for the loss of ad dollars.  Twitter lost $270 million in the quarter ending June 30, well before Musk took over and advertisers began to flee. It had only $2.7 billion of cash on hand on its balance sheet as of June 30. He has announced plans to charge users $8 a month to have verified accounts, and also announced deep staff cuts. Musk\u2019s two weeks of ownership of Twitter have been a \u201cdebacle of epic proportions,\u201d said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities. Although it\u2019s possible that the money from Musk\u2019s sale of Twitter sales the last two week may have gone toward paying off some short-term financing used to close the Twitter deal, it can\u2019t be ruled out that it was made necessary by big losses at Twitter. \u201cThe more he gets into Twitter, the more it becomes a quicksand type of deal,\u201d said Ives. Tesla\u2019s falling stock This is not the best time to be selling Tesla shares, which have lost 46% of their value so far this year on disappointing sales caused by supply chain problems. Musk received an average price of  $202.52 for the Tesla shares he sold since the Twitter deal closed, which is down 10% just since he closed on his deal to buy Twitter.  Shares of Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) fell 1.5% in premarket trading Wednesday. The company is facing growing competition in the electric vehicle market from established automakers such as Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors. And some investors have expressed concerns that Musk will be too distracted by his purchase of Twitter to give enough attention to addressing Tesla\u2019s problems. \u201cTesla investors are exacerbated by this never ending Twitter albatross,\u201d said Ives. \u201cMusk needs to look in the mirror and end this constant merry-go-round of Twitter overhang on the Tesla story with his focus back on the golden child Tesla which needs his time more than ever.\u201d Musk\u2019s stock sales These three most recent blocks of Tesla stock sales represent only 4% of the shares that Musk owns outright through a trust, and less than 3% of his holdings if options that he has to buy additional shares are included. Musk agreed to buy Twitter\n            \n                (TWTR) in April, shortly after filings showed he had purchased 73 million shares, or about a 9% stake, for $2.6 billion. The purchases made him the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Soon after the deal was announced, he disclosed he had sold $8.5 billion worth of Tesla shares, a move seen as a first step to raise the cash he would need to complete the purchase of Twitter. Even after Musk announced a change of heart and fought a lawsuit brought by Twitter to force him to buy the company, he continued to sell Tesla shares. Filings in August showed he had sold an additional $6.9 billion worth of Tesla shares. Musk\u2019s filings did not disclose the reason for those earlier stock sales. But after someone on Twitter asked him if he was done selling Tesla shares, he responded \u201cYes\u201d and then pointed to the possibility of being forced to buy Twitter as the reason for those sales. Since Musk\u2019s earlier Tesla sales, shares of Tesla have split three-for-one, meaning he needed to sell three times as many shares in order to raise as much cash. But his holdings of Tesla shares also tripled due to the split. Before his interest in Twitter, Musk rarely sold shares of Tesla stock, primarily selling shares necessary to pay taxes when exercising stock options.  He sold a total of 15.7 million pre-split shares at the end of 2021, netting a total of $16.4 billion, because he had to exercise stock options or risk having them expire. He likely ended up with a tax bill of more than $10 billion. But even after paying that tax bill and the cost to exercise those options, he likely had roughly $5 billion left over. He may have used some of that cash to buy his initial Twitter stake. These latest sales represent the lowest price at which Musk has sold Tesla shares recently, off about 30% from his sales in April and August when adjusted for the Tesla stock split since then, and down 42% from what he received when he sold shares in late 2021. \u2013 CNN Business\u2019 Clare Duffy and Catherine Thorbecke contributed to this report",

            "text": "China staged a low-key but historic debut of its C919 civil jet at its biggest airshow on Tuesday, with some delegates unable to attend the scaled-down event because of Beijing\u2019s zero-Covid policy as cases reached the highest level in six months. In a reminder of the continuing health crisis slowing China\u2019s return to global aviation, the organisers of Airshow China in the southern city of Zhuhai had urged attendees to arrive three days early because of Covid-19 precautions. Even then, some were blocked from joining day one because they had visited a Beijing district that had positive cases last week, three attendees said. A China-based executive at a Western engine maker said a lot of Beijing-based delegates had returned home in frustration, though some were allowed in at the last minute. Organisers did not respond to a request for comment.  China\u2019s zero-Covid policy has hampered its domestic aviation industry and kept international traffic at a tiny fraction of pre-pandemic levels as Western carriers rebound sharply. The zero-Covid policy comes amid a broader decoupling from the West as China aims for increased self-reliance amid the effects of strict export sanctions placed on Russian aviation after Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cZhuhai is of intense interest to China aviation spotters, and missing the show is a significant lost opportunity for those seeking to understand China\u2019s opaque commercial and defence aerospace sectors,\u201d said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor of FlightGlobal. Tuesday\u2019s opening marked the first time Western plane giants Airbus and Boeing have shared the stage with China\u2019s new COMAC C919 single-aisle jet at the showpiece event. The newly certified homegrown rival to the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX took part in the show\u2019s flying display for the first time, performing sharp 45-degree turns in green, white and blue livery.  Earlier, four J-20 stealth fighter jets streaked by in close formation. Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) reported orders from leasing firms for 300 C919s and 30 ARJ21 regional jets. As with previous announcements, it was not immediately clear how many were firm orders or expressions of interest. COMAC plans the first C919 delivery to China Eastern in December. Turning Point Analysts say it will be some time before the C919 cracks open an entrenched Airbus-Boeing market duopoly outside China, but Tuesday\u2019s display marked a turning point 10 years after first orders were unveiled at the same event. By contrast, the sun was setting in China on Tuesday on one of Europe\u2019s most visible global symbols, the double-decker A380. Tracking website FlightRadar24 said China Southern Airlines operated its last A380 flight from Los Angeles on Tuesday. The airline did not answer a request for comment. Production of the world\u2019s largest jetliner ended last year after weak sales including a near-failure to conquer China\u2019s market. An auction of A380 parts was held in France last month. Analysts say Airbus does however enjoy brisk demand for the best-selling A320neo, buoyed by US tensions that have delayed renewed Boeing MAX deliveries following a safety crisis. Airbus on Tuesday formally booked an order for 40 A320neo-family jets from all-Boeing operator Xiamen Airlines. China watchers said the airline\u2019s decision to loosen its dependence on Boeing was viewed as particularly symbolic after Chinese leader Xi Jinping visited the cockpit of a larger Xiamen 787 on a visit to Boeing\u2019s Seattle-area factory in 2015. Europe also made new inroads with the certification for Chinese markets of its ATR 42-600 turboprop after a long wait. The show unfolded against the backdrop of rising tensions between China and Taiwan after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei in August, sparking huge Chinese military exercises at a time when the world is also on edge over the Ukraine conflict. State-owned Global Times reported that a new anti-drone defence system built around the HQ-17AE short-range air defense missile complex would make its Zhuhai debut as a countermeasure for low, slow and small drones that are difficult to identify and attack with traditional anti-air systems. China is also showing off a FH-97A \u201cLoyal Wingman\u201d drone model designed to coordinate with crewed aircraft, the newspaper reported. The aircraft is different from the FH-97 concept first displayed last year. The FH-97 is nearly identical to the US-developed Kratos Defense and Security Solutions XQ-58A Valkyrie, which first flew in 2019, while the FH-97A looks more like Boeing\u2019s Australian-developed MQ-28 Ghost Bat, photographs indicate. \u201cEarly images from the show suggest it will again be a major bazaar of Chinese UAV technology, including what appear to be mockups of unmanned combat aircraft that could one day accompany Chinese J-20 fighters into combat,\u201d Waldron said. \u201cStill, it can be very hard to understand if the various UAV models at the show represent real programmes with investment from the Chinese military.\u201d",

            "text": "While investors, business leaders and some economic models continue to warn a recession is imminent, Wall Street\u2019s most powerful investment bank remains cautiously optimistic. Goldman Sachs told clients on Monday it still sees a 35% chance of a US recession in the next 12 months. While that is double the normal risk of a recession, it is far below the 63% average in a recent forecaster survey by The Wall Street Journal. \u201cWe still see a very plausible non-recessionary four-step path from the high-inflation economy of the present to a low-inflation economy of the future,\u201d Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a report. In other words, a recession is not a slam dunk. The Federal Reserve can still pull off a soft landing for the US economy. By contrast, a Bloomberg Economics model released in late October determined the risk of a recession over the next 12 months stands at a staggering 100%. A probability model run by Ned Davis Research similarly found a 98.1% chance of a global recession. But Goldman Sachs pointed out the transition to more sustainable \u2014 but still positive \u2014 economic growth \u201chas already occurred, and it looks durable.\u201d The bank expects gross domestic product growth of about 1% over the next year. Despite Friday\u2019s stronger-than-expected jobs report, Goldman Sachs says the rebalancing of the job market \u201clooks to be on track.\u201d And the bank is impressed by the fact that wages have cooled off, though they remain high. \u201cThe most encouraging recent step on the narrow path to a soft landing has been the slowdown in nominal wage growth,\u201d Hatzius wrote. But the biggest problem facing the economy \u2014 high inflation \u2014 remains a major challenge. Goldman Sachs concedes that there has been \u201cmuch less progress\u201d on the price side. Inflation metrics have mostly stopped getting worse but they also haven\u2019t really got any better either.",

            "text": "Ryanair carried a record number of passengers over the summer and says its budget friendly airfares will attract even more customers as Europe falls into a recession. The low-cost carrier posted its highest ever half-year profit on Monday, earning \u20ac1.37 billion ($1.36 billion) for the six months through September. That beat its previous record high of \u20ac1.15 billion ($1.14 billion) in 2019. It carried 95.1 million passengers during the period, up from 39.1 million a year ago. That\u2019s 11% higher than the same period in 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic hit. Ryanair\n            \n                (RYAAY) now expects to carry 168 million passengers in the 12 months through March 2023 \u2014 1.5 million more than its previous forecast and 13% higher than the year before the pandemic. The company\u2019s stock jumped 3.7% in Dublin. Ryanair has emerged from the coronavirus pandemic stronger than ever, even as several of its competitors went bankrupt or needed government-backed bailouts. It was also able to avoid the staff shortages that plagued many of its rivals over the summer, including budget airline EasyJet.  Ryanair CEO Michael O\u2019Leary said cuts by rivals to fleets and passenger capacity have created \u201cenormous growth opportunities\u201d for the Irish carrier, which has seen its market share \u201csurge\u201d across major European markets.  \u201cMillions of passengers are switching to flying Ryanair and we suspect that will continue,\u201d O\u2019Leary said in a video posted on the company\u2019s website.  He said that concerns about the impact of recession and inflation on Ryanair\u2019s business were \u201coverblown.\u201d \u201cPeople don\u2019t stop flying during recessions, but they become much more price sensitive\u2026 Ryanair grows more strongly in a recession because we have a huge cost advantage over our competitors, that cost advantage is widening, and people becoming more price sensitive turn to us,\u201d he added. The strong earnings mean the company will reverse pandemic pay cuts for over 90% of its pilots and cabin crew from next month \u2014 earlier than planned. \u201cThese long-term pay agreements with the vast majority of our people have now delivered fully restored pay 28 months earlier than previously agreed,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.  While Ryanair has recovered from the pandemic faster than much of the aviation industry, its growth next year could be hampered by Boeing\n            \n                (BA)\u2019s \u201ccontinuing inability to meet its delivery schedule,\u201d according to O\u2019Leary.  The planemaker has promised to deliver all of the 51 \u201cGamechanger\u201d 737 aircraft Ryanair has ordered before next summer, but O\u2019Leary thinks there\u2019s a growing risk of \u201cslippage\u201d with these deliveries. Known for his forthright manner, the airline boss described Boeing management as \u201cheadless chickens\u201d earlier this year in a scathing criticism of aircraft delays. Despite the strong results, O\u2019Leary said Ryanair\u2019s recovery remains \u201cfragile\u201d and \u201cprone to shocks\u201d from new Covid variants or the war in Ukraine. ",

            "title": "The latest in luxurious first-class airplane suites: Building up",
            "text": "With airlines seeking to use the floor space footprint of their first-class suites as efficiently as possible, the latest developments in making these ultraswanky experiences even more luxurious aren\u2019t about adding more width or length to the suites.  They\u2019re about going up. A new generation of high-wall supersuites are stretching up to the ceilings of the latest wide-body jets, eclipsing the suites that came before. The first generation of first-class suites with doors were introduced about 15 years ago on the Airbus A380. With the biggest commercial airplane ever built came the biggest first-class seats, and these quickly spread onto other airliners such as the Boeing 777. In the decade and a half since, most first-class seats now have doors. The main function of the doors is privacy, allowing first class passengers some of the top luxuries in our always-on world: the opportunity to create their own space to work, relax with a movie on a big screen or enjoy Champagne-and-caviar private dining.   Yet until recently, the first-class doors themselves didn\u2019t extend all the way to the ceiling, ending instead at about chest height for most passengers, which means that the crew and other passengers who are passing by can see in.  This is by design, since safety specifications mean that crew members need to be able to see into the suite. These sets of rules are known as cabin view requirements, and they essentially mean that crew must have a line of sight into the cabin from their jump seats by the emergency doors during takeoff and landing. (For those of us not in first class, cabin view requirements are also why crew have to tie up curtains before landing, as well as why those little horizontal letterbox-shaped hatches in the bulkhead dividers between cabin classes exist.) But the airlines with high-wall suites are managing to meet those requirements, too.    Stretching up Some suites went higher than others. Etihad\u2019s first-class Apartments on the A380 were tall but not ceiling-height, although its The Residence suite had a closed-off bedroom separate from the seats that Residence passengers had to use for takeoff and landing.  Emirates was the first airline to introduce the high-wall supersuite category with its latest Boeing 777 first-class suites, which are entirely enclosed and allow passengers to customize their experience all the way down to the color of the accent lighting. Emirates uses closed-circuit TV cameras \u2013 accessible only live and only by cabin crew \u2013 to get around those cabin view requirements. The latest airline to go in for these high-wall supersuites is Lufthansa. It is working with seatmaker Collins Aerospace and design house PriestmanGoode to create its game-changing Allegris first-class suite. So far, Lufthansa isn\u2019t saying how it manages to meet cabin view requirements, but if there is only one row of seats, it may be as simple as a set of mirrors that mean crew can see into the suites when the doors are open for takeoff and landing. As with any airline seat, prices fluctuate but these experiences can stretch into the tens of thousands of dollars. CNN Travel sat down with Daniel Macinnes, director at PriestmanGoode,  to learn more about how these new suites are designed, why airlines are choosing them, how they fit into the aircraft and how they have to be designed for certification.   A complicated equation Macinnes says the big question is \u201chow do you not lose the quality of the product with all of the certification, all of those details? So it\u2019s been a quite a challenge, but quite an interesting one, getting past certification, past EASA, all of those things.\u201d EASA is the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and together with the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States, it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s two primary aviation safety regulators. It takes the safety certification lead for aircraft produced by European planemaker Airbus. Creating the new Lufthansa supersuite, Macinnes says, \u201cwas quite an exciting challenge, because for the first aircraft that it goes on to, which is an A350, no one\u2019s ever done this before.\u201d  When creating any new seating experience, but especially when pushing the boundaries of premium cabins like this one, there\u2019s a lot of interplay between the airplane maker, the seat maker, the airline and their design partner \u2013  or partners. The new Lufthansa seat has been developed over five years, a collaboration between the airline\u2019s product experience and brand teams, Airbus, PriestmanGoode and Collins. \u201cWe did many, many versions of this over those years to see what worked, what heights worked \u2013 with their management team, with the product team, building mockups, just really kind of seeing how that fed their excitement,\u201d Macinnes explains.  Adding comfort During the design process, the team had to make a variety of adjustments, such as removing the overhead bins and adding a wardrobe into the door support.  That means that passengers can change in the space of the suite \u2013 no need to head to the lavatories \u2013 into the luxury pajamas the airline provides and then hang up their clothes.  That makes for a more comfortable and relaxing flight in pajamas made from breathable fabrics, without tight waistbands, and it\u2019s pure pleasure to put on a fresh set of PJs after the hustle and bustle of the airport. It also means that your clothes finish the flight fresh, uncreased and ready to be worn to your final destination. The team also made sure that the cabin airflow \u2013 carefully engineered by the airplane manufacturer to optimize temperature and fresh air for the cabin  \u2013 is not disrupted, as well as figuring out just how high the walls could go before the air conditioning system needed to be redesigned for a fully enclosed suite. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of space\u201d at the top of the walls of the Lufthansa suite, Macinnes says, noting that \u201cwe got to a point where it was the sweet spot everybody was happy with.\u201d The critical part of the design, Macinnes explains, is \u201cthat it makes it feel like it\u2019s your own space, rather than \u2026 to make it an open cabin. They wanted that kind of privacy, and you\u2019ve got enough space that you don\u2019t need to really feel like you\u2019re kind of closed in. It\u2019s not like a closed-off business class \u2013 you\u2019ve got a lot of space within this. So even if you sit there with the door closed, it feels big, you don\u2019t feel trapped.\u201d The future of first class is very much a high-walled one. Images for Qantas\u2019 forthcoming Airbus A350 first class for nonstop Sydney flights to New York and London show higher walls than the airline has used before. The trick, of course, is to do it in a way that fits the most neatly with the cabin.",

            "text": "The spike in shipping rates since the onset of the pandemic has been a huge boon for Maersk. But the Danish shipping giant is warning its business will have to endure tougher times soon.  The company said Wednesday that a looming global recession is expected to reduce container demand by between 2% and 4% in 2022, with \u201cplenty of dark clouds on the horizon.\u201d Shares of Maersk, which are perceived as a barometer of the health of the economy due to the company\u2019s exposure to the movement of goods around the world, fell nearly 6%. The stock has dropped 35% so far this year.  While Maersk earned record profits last quarter due to \u201csubstantially higher freight rates,\u201d it said that rates began to drop toward the end of the period \u201cdue to weakening customer demand, coupled with markets beginning to normalize with fewer supply chain disruptions\u201d and less congestion. Plus, ocean freight volumes are down. CEO S\u00f8ren Skou told CNN\u2019s Julia Chatterley this decline is \u201cclearly a sign that the consumer is not spending as much money as he or she has done in the last few years, and probably also a sign that many of our customers have too much inventory.\u201d Consumption in general, he added, is \u201cweighed down by very, very negative sentiment.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a macroeconomist, but I would be surprised if Europe is not in recession by now,\u201d Skou said. He thinks the United States is likely to follow \u201csometime next year.\u201d Demand for bigger goods like televisions, couches or BBQs has also fallen after people made big purchases during lockdowns. Now, they won\u2019t need to buy replacements for some time. \u201cOnce you buy that, you probably don\u2019t have that demand again for another few years,\u201d Skou said.",

            "text": "A shortage of airline pilots is leading pilots at America\u2019s largest carriers to push for better pay and benefits.     The union representing United Airlines\n            \n                (UAL) pilots said Tuesday its members rejected a tentative contract, voting 94% against the deal. It accused management of delays and said pilots deserve better now that the airline is profitable again. United said after the vote that it expected the rejection and is \u201calready working with ALPA on a new, industry-leading agreement that we expect to include improved pay rates and other enhancements.\u201d       The announcement comes a day after Delta Air Lines\n            \n                (DAL) pilots voted 99% in favor to authorize a potential future strike. The vote does not mean a strike is imminent, and the timeline does not allow for a work stoppage around Thanksgiving travel.    A pilot shortage fueled by pandemic-era retirements and other issues led many regional airlines \u2014 the companies that fly smaller planes under brands like Delta Connection, United Express, and American Eagle \u2014 to hike pay significantly. Just last month, the Teamsters announced regional pilots with Republic Airways would see raises between 54% and 94%l    Many pilot careers begin at regional airlines before they move to the mainline carriers, and pay was dramatically lower than at the larger airlines.  But the raises and premium pay \u2014 such as for training other pilots \u2014 means some regional pilots will be able to earn more than pilots at the major airlines.    \u201cThere are cases where their instructor pilots are getting paid more than an international widebody captain at American,\u201d said Dennis Tajer, the spokesman for the pilots union at American Airlines and who is also a 737 captain.   American\u2019s pilots may soon consider a tentative agreement between their union \u2014 the Allied Pilots Association \u2014 and the airline, Tajer said. Analysts at the investment bank Barclays predicted in a report last week that \u201cthe new tentative agreement at American likely stands a difficult, if not severely challenged, path to approval.\u201d    The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association recently told its members that negotiations have drawn another $1.2 billion in value from the airline\u2019s previous tentative agreement.    Simultaneous negotiations at all four of the largest airlines are taking place now as the pandemic put negotiations at multiple carriers on hold. It means airline executives are closely watching each other. Agreements also often include provisions that allow for raises if other airlines sign for a higher pay rate.     The situation \u201cis creating a bit of a complication for management, which I think for pilots is a good thing,\u201d Jalmer Johnson, the pay consultant working for the Southwest union, said in a union podcast.    \u201cWhen one pilot group gets an agreement particularly on major economic issues \u2026  it really does set a floor for the remaining groups that are in bargaining to improve upon,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThose groups are not going to accept something less than has already been established.\u201d    Southwest did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the negotiations. The votes by United and Delta pilots are not the only way airline contract negotiations have spilled into public view. Delta pilots have held a series of so-called informational picketing events at airports around the country where they sought to raise awareness of their working conditions. Other work groups, including Southwest flight attendants, have done the same.    Delta said despite the strike vote, the airline and pilots \u201chave made significant progress in our negotiations and have only a few contract sections left to resolve.\u201d \u201cWe are confident that the parties will reach an agreement that is fair and equitable, as we always have in past negotiations,\u201d the airline said in a statement to CNN.  Another raise influencing negotiations is Alaska Airlines\u2019 new pilot contract, announced in October, with pay boosts of up to 23% in some bands.     Tajer, with APA, said the Alaska contract \u201cbroke through the sound barrier\u201d as negotiations continued at other carriers. \u201cYou have management teams that are actually looking more closely at each other than they are looking at their actual labor groups,\u201d Tajer, with American, said. \u201cAll these management teams are worried they\u2019re going to be left as an outlier paying too much.\u201d   - CNN\u2019s Pete Muntean contributed to this report.

            "text": "SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy \u2014 a towering, three-pronged vehicle that is the most powerful operational rocket in the world \u2014 returned to the skies on Tuesday for the first time since mid-2019. The rocket launched at 9:41 a.m. ET from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, hauling satellites to space for the US military in a secretive mission dubbed USSF-44. The Falcon Heavy debuted in 2018 to much fanfare as SpaceX CEO Elon Musk elected to launch his personal Tesla Roadster as a test payload on the launch. The car is still in space, taking an oblong path around the sun that swings out as far as Mars\u2019 orbital path. Since that first test mission, SpaceX has launched only two other Falcon Heavy missions, both in 2019. One sent a hulking TV and phone service satellite to orbit for Saudi Arabia-based Arabsat, and the other delivered a batch of experimental satellites for the US Department of Defense. But the rocket had not launched since 2019, as the vast majority of SpaceX\u2019s missions don\u2019t require the Falcon Heavy\u2019s amped up power. SpaceX\u2019s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, on the other hand, has launched nearly 50 missions so far this year alone. With each Falcon Heavy launch, the rocket puts on a dramatic showing back on Earth.  After Tuesday\u2019s mission, the company only attempted to recover two of the Falcon Heavy rocket\u2019s first-stage rocket boosters  \u2014 the tall white sticks that are strapped together to give the rocket its heightened power at liftoff.  As planned, the center booster was left to plunge into the ocean, where it will remain, because it did not have enough leftover fuel to guide its journey home, according to a news release from the US military\u2019s Space Systems Command.  The two side boosters, however, made their signature synchronized landing on ground pads near the Florida coastline. In the past, SpaceX has attempted to land all three of the rocket\u2019s boosters back on landing pads on land and at sea so that they can be refurbished and reused on future missions. It does this to cut down on mission costs. The company has yet to suceed at retrieving all three, although it\u2019s come dramatically close. The two side boosters made a pinpoint, synchronized landing on ground pads after an April 2019 mission, and the rocket\u2019s center booster touched down on a sea-faring platform. But then, rough waves at sea toppled it over. All about this rocket Though the Falcon Heavy is the most powerful operational rocket in the world, there are two massive rockets waiting in the wings to claim that title. NASA\u2019s Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket, which is currently slated to attempt its inaugural launch later in November to send the uncrewed Artemis 1 mission around the moon, is sitting in the Kennedy Space Center\u2019s towering Vehicle Assembly Building, which lies just a few miles from the launch pad where the Falcon Heavy will take flight. While the Falcon Heavy gives off about five million pounds of thrust, SLS is expected to put off as much as 8.8 million pounds of thrust \u2014 15% more thrust than the Saturn V rockets that powered the mid-20th Century moon landings. And just across the Gulf Coast, at SpaceX\u2019s experimental facilities in South Texas, the company is in the final stages of preparing for the first orbital launch attempt of its Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket. Though the test flight is still awaiting final approval from federal regulators, it could take flight before the end of the year. The Starship system is expected to out-power both SLS and Falcon Heavy by a wide margin. The forthcoming Super Heavy booster, which is designed to vault the Starship spacecraft into space, is expected to put off about 17 million pounds of thrust alone. Both the SLS rocket and SpaceX\u2019s Starship are integral to NASA\u2019s plans to return astronauts to the surface of the moon for the first time in half a century.  SpaceX also has its own, ambitious vision for the Starship: ferrying humans and cargo to Mars in the hopes of one day establishing a permanent human settlement there.  All about this mission There is not much publicly available information about the USSF-44 mission. In a news release, the US military\u2019s Space Systems Command said only that the launch will put multiple satellites into orbit on behalf of the Space Systems Command\u2019s Innovation and Prototyping Delta, which is focused on quickly developing space technology as it relates to tracking objects in space as well as a range of other activities. The Space System Command declined to provide additional information about the mission when reached by email. It referred questions to the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, which also declined comment. The US military is one of the primary drivers of the domestic rocket economy, doling out lucrative launch contracts that are coveted by private launch companies including SpaceX and its chief competitor in the area, United Launch Alliance, which is a joint operation between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

With 96% of members participating in an Air Line Pilots Association union vote, 99% of Delta pilots \u201cauthorized union leaders to call a strike, if necessary, to achieve a new contractual agreement,\u201d the union said.   Delta pilots say they are working under an outdated contract from 2016. ALPA says that on-again, off-again contract talks began more than three years ago, and mediated talks resumed in January. Pilots at other airlines \u2014 especially regional carriers \u2014 have negotiated substantial pay bumps this year as airlines deal with a pilot shortage. \u201cOur negotiations have dragged on for too long,\u201d Captain Jason Ambrosi of the Delta chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association said in a statement, noting that the airline recorded \u201crecord\u201d revenues in the third quarter. \u201cOur goal is to reach an agreement, not to strike,\u201d Ambrosi said. Walking off the job will not happen immediately. The ALPA says a mediation board must first weigh in on arbitration, then would enter a 30-day \u201ccooling off\u201d period. That means a strike could not begin before the Thanksgiving travel surge. CNN has asked the union if a strike could impact Christmas travel. \u201cDelta pilots are not on strike, so this authorization vote will not affect our operation for our customers,\u201d a Delta spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cDelta and ALPA have made significant progress in our negotiations and have only a few contract sections left to resolve. We are confident that the parties will reach an agreement that is fair and equitable, as we always have in past negotiations.\u201d",

            "text": "Boeing reported an unexpected loss in the third quarter Wednesday after taking a massive $2.8 billion charge related to its high profile defense and space businesses, including completing the new versions of Air Force One and its much delayed Starliner space capsule. The company also continued to report losses from its core commercial jet unit, even with increased deliveries lifting revenue for the company in an otherwise disappointing quarter of red ink. The charges in the defense and space businesses were for contracts where Boeing gets a fixed amount of revenue from its government clients and isn\u2019t able to pass along cost increases.  Those programs include refurbishing two 747 jets that will become the next generation of Air Force One. The delivery of those planes was again delayed during the quarter and now won\u2019t be completed for at least another four years.  The company is being paid $3.9 billion for the jets and has already taken a $660 million charge for losses on the planes in the first quarter of this year. CEO Dave Calhoun said at the time that the contract had been a mistake for the company.  Another source of the charge came from the Starliner program to build capsules to carry astronauts to the International Space Station. In August, Boeing pushed back the first crewed flight of the long-delayed project to early next year. Also included in the charge was a training jet for Air Force pilots as well as tanker jets and drones used to refuel planes mid-flight.  The charge resulted in an operating loss of $2.8 billion at the defense and space unit, compared to a $436 million profit it made there last year. Boeing did not specify how much of this latest charge was related to each program. The commercial jet business delivered 112 planes in the quarter, up from 85 a year ago, including resumed deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner, which had been halted by the Federal Aviation Administration due to quality control problems. Those increased deliveries helped lift revenue 4% to $16 billion, which in turn helped Boeing have a positive cash flow in the quarter. But the commercial plane unit reported an operating loss of $643 million. \u201cWhile our cash generation was strong, our revenue and earnings were significantly impacted by losses on fixed-price development programs in our defense business, driven by higher estimated manufacturing and supply chain costs, as well as technical challenges,\u201d Calhoun said in a statement to employees. Boeing reported a net loss of $3.3 billion, far worse than the $132 million hit a year ago. The company had returned to profitability in the second quarter, with net income of $160 million, and analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had been forecasting another net profit of $347 million. The company posted a core operating loss of $3.1 billion, compared to the narrow operating profit of $59 million a year earlier and earnings of $490 million on that basis in the second quarter of this year. Analysts had been expecting core operating earnings of $648 million rather than the massive loss. The company said it should still have positive cash flow for the year, despite all the problems, which likely prevented the stock from plunging on the report. Shares of Boeing\n            \n                (BA), a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, were mostly flat in early trading Wednesday.",

The request comes after a float plane carrying 10 people crashed into Mutiny Bay on the afternoon of September 4, killing everyone on board, including a child.  The investigation into the crash by the National Transportation Safety Board found \u201ca possible safety issue with a flight control\u201d on the De Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter after recovering 85% of the wreckage from the bay, the agency said Monday.   \u201cInvestigators found the horizontal stabilizer actuator, which is part of the airplane\u2019s pitch trim control system and is also referred to as the trim jack, had separated into two pieces,\u201d the agency said. They concluded those pieces separated by unthreading, not by being pulled apart. The safety board also explained that investigators were unable to locate a locking ring that holds the two pieces in place. \u201cAt this time, the NTSB does not know whether the lock ring was installed before the airplane impacted the water or why the lock ring was not present during the airplane examination,\u201d the agency noted, underscoring that it has not reached a final conclusion as to the cause of the crash. The board, along with Transportation Safety Board of Canada, has asked the maker of the aircraft to draft written instructions on how to conduct inspections of the actuator to ensure that the lock ring is in place and properly engaged to prevent the separation of the two pieces.  \u201cThose instructions will be released and provided to all operators of the DHC-3 airplane worldwide in a Service Letter,\u201d investigators said.  At the time of the crash, Broadway star Megan Hilty said on social media her pregnant sister Lauren Hilty, brother-in-law Ross Mickel and their toddler son, Remy, were aboard the plane.  \u201cMy beloved sister Lauren, brother-in-law Ross and baby nephew Remy were on that plane,\u201d Hilty wrote last month on her verified Instagram account. \u201cTo make this news even more devastating, my sister was eight months pregnant and we were expecting to welcome baby boy Luca into the world next month.\u201d The investigation into the crash remains underway as the transportation board works to determine a probable cause for it.  \u201cAn evaluation of lock ring failure modes and lock ring installation instructions will be accomplished in addition to an aircraft performance study,\u201d the board said.

In December, some crash victims\u2019 relatives said the US Justice Department violated their legal rights when it struck a January 2021 deferred prosecution agreement with the planemaker over two crashes that killed 346 people.  The families argued the government \u201clied and violated their rights through a secret process\u201d and asked US District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor to rescind Boeing\u2019s immunity from criminal prosecution \u2013 which was part of the $2.5 billion agreement \u2013 and order the planemaker publicly arraigned on felony charges. O\u2019Connor ruled on Friday that \u201cin sum, but for Boeing\u2019s criminal conspiracy to defraud the (Federal Aviation Administration), 346 people would not have lost their lives in the crashes.\u201d Paul Cassell, a lawyer for the families, said the ruling \u201cis a tremendous victory\u201d and \u201csets the stage for a pivotal hearing, where we will present proposed remedies that will allow criminal prosecution to hold Boeing fully accountable.\u201d Boeing did not immediately comment. After the families filed the legal challenge saying their rights were violated under the Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act, Attorney General Merrick Garland met with some of them but stood by the plea deal, which included a $244 million fine, $1.77 billion compensation to airlines and a $500 million crash-victim fund. The deal capped a 21-month investigation into the design and development of the 737 MAX following the deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019.  Boeing did not disclose key details to the FAA of a safety system called MCAS, which was linked to both fatal crashes and designed to help counter a tendency of the MAX to pitch up. \u201cHad Boeing not committed its crime\u201d pilots in Ethiopia and Indonesia would have \u201creceived training adequate to respond to the MCAS activation that occurred on both aircrafts,\u201d O\u2019Connor ruled. The crashes, which have cost Boeing more than $20 billion in compensation, production costs, and fines, and led to a 20-month grounding for the best-selling plane, prompted Congress to pass legislation reforming FAA airplane certification. Boeing wants Congress to waive a December deadline imposed by the legislation for the FAA to certify the MAX 7 and MAX 10. After that date, all planes must have modern cockpit alerting systems, which the 737 planes do not have. Last month, Boeing paid $200 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges it misled investors about the MAX.",

            "text": "Whether Donald Trump is prepared to take-off on another bid for the presidency remains up in the air, but his fabled Boeing 757 is definitely getting off the ground.  According to flight data studied and analyzed by CNN and aviation experts consulted by CNN, Trump\u2019s jet has spent several hours over the last week running pattern flights above a small airport in Lake Charles, Louisiana, likely testing various updated components before heading to the Palm Beach International Airport, where it arrived Wednesday evening. Trump has previously indicated that the plane would be in Louisiana for repairs. The plane\u2019s arrival in West Palm Beach comes less than three weeks before the 2022 midterm elections and with the political world on constant watch for Trump to announce another run for the White House. While Trump\u2019s world has felt under siege with multiple investigations and legal actions open against him, the return of so-called \u201cTrump Force One\u201d to its home base could provide a jolt to Trump\u2019s fans.  The arrival of the plane at the airport that\u2019s just 15 minutes from Mar-a-Lago is a significant indicator that not only is it airworthy \u2013 the 31-year-old jumbo jet had been idle for the four years of Trump\u2019s presidency and many months afterward \u2013 it may be getting prepped to assume its former life as Trump\u2019s biggest campaign prop.  CNN has reached out to a representative for Donald Trump for comment on the plane\u2019s activity and has not yet received a response. The plane appeared to be in use Saturday as Trump traveled to Texas for a rally, according to a tweet from Trump aide Dan Scavino Jr. Trump\u2019s jet has twice in recent days made a series of short flight loops at varying altitudes, taking off and landing at Chennault International Airport in Louisiana. Some of the flights lasted less than 10 minutes, according to the data, and did not go beyond altitudes of 3,000 feet. Others were longer, 20 to 30 minutes, at altitudes ranging from 9,000 to 23,000 feet.   \u201cIt is common after a plane has had upgrades \u2013 or other new equipment or general avionic tweaks \u2013 for pilots to make a series of test flights to ensure safety and function,\u201d said Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board. \u201cThe series of passes at different altitudes, such as the ones completed in Louisiana, are indicative of standard checks.\u201d  That the plane, which Trump purchased in 2010 from the late Microsoft founder Paul Allen, has been improved to the point of taking flight is a recent development. In March 2021, CNN was first to report Trump\u2019s once omnipresent 757 was sitting idle on a tarmac at a small New York state airport with one engine shrink-wrapped, mechanically grounded. It remained just north of New York City at Stewart Airport in New Windsor, New York, for several more months before it was flown to Louisiana on November 1, 2021, according to flight tracker information obtained by CNN.   That flight was presumably made with an engine worthy enough for the plane to obtain a Special Flight Permit \u2013 or \u201cFerry Permit\u201d \u2013 from the FAA, multiple experts told CNN. The permits allow registered planes to be approved for flight. According to FAA data, a reason for granting a ferry permit is for an aircraft to fly to a location where \u201crepairs, alterations, or maintenance are to be performed, or to a point of salvage.\u201d  CNN has requested a confirmation of the ferry permit issued for Trump\u2019s plane, which is owned by DJT Operations LLC, from the FAA and has not yet received the information.  A standard passenger Boeing 757-200 series has about 228 seats. Trump\u2019s custom 757 features 43 seats \u2013 along with a main bedroom, guest suite, dining room, VIP area and custom galley. Trump has mainly flown to-and-from various destinations on his much smaller, eight-seater, 1997 Cessna 750 Citation X. That plane does have a small Trump-family crest painted on the fuselage but lacks the giant Trump name on its outside.  According to flight records, when Trump is not on the Citation, he typically flies on chartered planes belonging to other people. Yet in July of this year, the 757, a regular backdrop for Trump\u2019s campaign appearances and rallies during the run-up to the 2016 election, was featured in a slick video posted by Eric Trump to social media. That video featured the 757 getting a new paint job at a hangar in Louisiana.  \u201cShe\u2019s back,\u201d he wrote. In the caption of Eric Trump\u2019s Instagram post of the video, the former President was quoted teasing the rebirth of his beloved private plane, saying the sparkly new exterior tune-up done so \u201cTrump Force One\u201d \u2013 the plane\u2019s nickname \u2013 could be \u201cback to the skies in the Fall of 2022, or maybe sooner.\u201d  The reveal of the new paint job showed a fresh, gold \u201cTRUMP\u201d on the fuselage, and a new addition of an American flag on the tail. The paint job was completed in 26 days, according to Tyson Grenzebach, of Landlocked Aviation, who in a July interview with Louisiana Radio Network said his company did full \u201cscuff, sand and paint\u201d on Trump\u2019s plane.  Though the interior, exterior and \u2013 as of Wednesday \u2013 the sky worthiness of Trump\u2019s 757 appears to be updated, according to experts who spoke to CNN, the purpose of getting the plane ready for some sort of grand reveal near the midterms or a campaign announcement has yet to be confirmed by the former president.  For Trump, the plane is one of his prized possessions. He oversaw the hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollars\u2019 worth of renovations done to his prized possession shortly after he took ownership; any metal in the plane\u2019s interior \u2013 lights, seat buckles, handles, latches, knobs \u2013 was plated in 24-karat gold. In March of last year, following CNN\u2019s story about the 757, Trump did release a statement confirming his plane was in \u201cstorage\u201d and getting repairs.  \u201cWhen completed, it will be better than ever, and again used at upcoming rallies!\u201d wrote Trump wrote at the time.",

            "text": "It wasn\u2019t until he moved near to an airfield in the UK over a decade ago that mechanical engineer Ashok Aliseril Thamarakshan began to seriously consider learning to fly a plane. He got his first taste of flying a few years later, when his wife Abhilasha bought him a 30-minute flight experience for his birthday. Aliseril, who is based in English county Essex, booked in some flying lessons at a local airfield and flew to the Isle of Wight, an island off the south coast of England, during his first session. \u201cThat was quite an eye opener into how it [flying] gives you the freedom to just go places if you have that ability, and access to an aircraft,\u201d he tells CNN Travel. \u201cSo that really got me hooked.\u201d Aliseril got his private pilot\u2019s license in 2019 and soon began hiring planes for short flights.  Amateur build But as his family grew \u2013 he and Abhilasha now have two daughters, the two-seater planes typically available for private hire became even less suitable, and he began to mull over the idea of buying his own plane. Aliseril briefly considered buying an older aircraft, and looked at some that had been built in the 1960s and 1970s. However, he says he felt uneasy about the prospect of flying his family in an older aircraft that he wasn\u2019t familiar with, and didn\u2019t think it would be a \u201ccomfortable journey.\u201d Aliseril began to look into the possibility of building a plane himself, reasoning that this would allow him to gain a better understanding of the aircraft so that it would be easier to maintain in the long term. After researching self-assembly aircraft kits, he came across a four-seater plane manufactured by South African company Sling Aircraft that ticked all the right boxes. In January 2020, Aliseril flew to the Sling Aircraft factory facility in Johannesburg for the weekend in order to take the Sling TSi aircraft on a test flight and was so impressed that he decided to purchase it. \u201cThis was pre Covid, where travel was still very easy at the time,\u201d he explains. \u201cI ordered the first kit when I got back. And by the time it arrived, the UK was in full lockdown.\u201d Aliseril says his colleagues, some of whom had experience with building aircraft, initially offered to help with the build. But the restrictions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, which had spread across the world by this point, meant that this wasn\u2019t possible. Home assembly Undeterred, he constructed a small shed in his back garden and planned out the different stages of the project, which would be monitored by the Light Aircraft Association, a UK representative body that oversees the construction and maintenance of home-built aircraft, under an approval from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The rules for amateur built aircraft differ slightly from country to country. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has an experimental airworthiness category where special airworthiness certificates can be issued to kit built aircraft.  Amateur-built airplanes in the UK are investigated by the CAA, who will issue a \u201cPermit to Fly\u201d once satisfied that the aircraft is fit to fly. Although the start of the build was delayed slightly due to the Covid-19 restrictions in place in the UK at the time \u2013 the Light Aircraft Association inspector assigned to the project was required to visit his working space beforehand \u2013 Aliseril was able to begin in April 2020. While he notes that his engineering background helped in some ways, he believes that it was actually his home improvement experience that proved most useful while constructing the aircraft, which has a length of 7.175 meters and a height of 2.45 meters. \u201cThese aircraft kits are designed for any amateur to build, provided you\u2019re a bit hands-on and you\u2019ve got experience working with some specialist tools,\u201d he adds, describing the detailed \u201cIkea furniture type instructions\u201d with drawings that came with the kit. \u201cI would say generally, anyone can get involved in these sorts of builds.\u201d Lockdown project Aliseril completed the work himself, drafting in Abhilasha to assist with some of the sections that required more than one pair of hands. Their eldest daughter Tara, now seven, was on hand for tasks such as removing the plastic from each of the components. By the end of summer 2020, Aliseril had built the tail and the wings. He began constructing the fuselage section in October, when the next part of the kit arrived. Although he\u2019d initially planned to hire a workshop to construct the aircraft, Aliseril feels that creating a workspace at his home was the better choice. \u201cI could just step into the shed and work on it,\u201d he says. \u201cSo having everything just in the back garden really helped, even though space was tight.\u201d Each stage of the project had to be signed off by an inspector before he could move onto the next task \u2013 the Light Aircraft Association completed around 12 inspections in total. Once the majority of the components were constructed, and it was time to put the aircraft together, Aliseril moved everything from his home to a hangar near Cambridge for the final assembly and engine fit. The aircraft passed its final inspection a few months later.  It was one of the first Sling TSi homebuilt aircraft constructed in the UK. G-Diya, named after his youngest daughter, was signed off for its first flight in January 2022. Aliseril recalls waiting on the ground anxiously as a test pilot took the plane he\u2019d spent 18 months building up into the air.  Taking flight \u201cHe took it up for about 20 minutes, and then he came back,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a big relief. I couldn\u2019t lift my head up to see what was happening [during the test flight].\u201d That first flight was hugely significant in many ways. \u201cWith these build projects, everyone calls it a project until it\u2019s first flown,\u201d he explains. \u201cOnce it\u2019s flown, it\u2019s always called an aircraft. You never call it a project anymore. That\u2019s psychologically a big step.\u201d When it was time to fly the aircraft for the first time himself, Aliseril was accompanied by another experienced test pilot. While he admits to being decidedly cautious, the test pilot was \u201cthrowing the aircraft about as if it was a racing car.\u201d  \u201cI was feeling very nervous, I didn\u2019t want to put any extra stress on it,\u201d Aliseril explains. \u201cBut he [the test pilot] was really pushing it to the limits. And it was good to experience that. I know that it [the aircraft] can handle this much. \u201cOnce I landed, he [the test pilot] clapped his hands and said \u2018Congratulations, you\u2019ve just landed the plane you built.\u2019 That was a great feeling.\u201d G-Diya, which has a range of 1,389 kilometers, went through a number of further test flights before it was issued with a permit to fly in May 2022. The following weekend, Aliseril flew with his wife and daughters Diya and Tara, four, to the Isle of Wight, where they took a short taxi ride from the airfield to the beach.  \u201cThe kids were really happy,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that sort of freedom. And the fact that we could just do that on a Saturday and still be back by 4 p.m. That was a great feeling.\u201d Over the past few months, Aliseril and his family have flown back to the Isle of Wight, and have also made trips to Skegness, a seaside town in eastern England and the village of Turweston in Buckinghamshire. They\u2019ve been documenting their trips on Instagram. In June 2022, he took a one-week trip around northern Europe with a pilot friend, and flew to the Czech Republic, Austria and Germany.  While Aliseril stresses that he\u2019s still a relatively new pilot \u2013 he currently has around 125 hours of flying hours under his belt \u2013 his confidence is growing with every flight and he\u2019s working towards flying to Europe with his family. Family trips \u201cThat\u2019s the plan going forward,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can take trips within the UK on a weekend, when the weather is good. And in the summer holidays, we can book out a week and then fly into Europe.\u201d For Aliseril, one of the main benefits of the plane, aside from the freedom it provides him and his family, is the friendships he\u2019s formed with other pilots.  He was always mindful that owning an aircraft could become a financial burden, but has been able to get round this by working out an arrangement to share it with three others. \u201cTo get your private license, it costs quite a bit,\u201d he adds, before noting that many of those who\u2019ve taken on similar projects are either retired, or are people \u201cwho have the time and financial status\u201d to fund the process.   \u201cI kind of knew that from the beginning, and thought I\u2019d take that risk and try to do it myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew that once it was done, I would easily be able to find people to share that cost. And it\u2019s worked out quite well [for me].\u201d  Now that the aircraft is split equally between four people, \u201cit\u2019s only costing us around the price of an SUV,\u201d adds Aliseril.  \u201cIt\u2019s more fuel efficient in the air \u2013 it only takes about 20 liters of unleaded fuel per hour of flight,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the fuel costs are pretty much equal to driving.\u201d There\u2019s currently no hangar space at the airfields close to his home, so Aliseril is building a new hangar for the plane, which is still based near Cambridge, at an Essex airfield. As for the cost of the build, the kit was priced at around \u00a380,000 (about $91,000,) according to Aliseril, while added costs including avionics, as well as the plane\u2019s Rotax engine, propeller and other supplies, brought the total up to around \u00a3180,000 (around $203,000). He hopes that more young people will take on projects like this in the future, and points to shared aircraft ownership as a way to make things more cost efficient, as well as form connections in the aviation world. \u201cIt becomes a communal thing,\u201d he says. \u201cYou always have somebody to fly with if your family is not available. Also, having other pilots who are friends \u2013 you learn from each other.\u201d",

            "text": "A disastrous earnings report from Snap and less than inspiring results from Dow components American Express and Verizon weren\u2019t enough to keep the Wall Street bulls at bay Friday. Stocks surged on hopes that the Federal Reserve may soon come to the rescue by slowing the pace of its rate hikes. The Dow rose nearly 750 points, or 2.5%, even as AmEx\n            \n                (AXP) and Verizon\n            \n                (VZ) fell nearly 2% and 5% respectively. The Dow has now gained for the past three weeks, its longest weekly winning streak of the year. It was a broad-based rally, with all sectors rallying. In fact, Verizon and AmEx were the only two Dow stocks that weren\u2019t in green Friday. Blue chip stocks Exxon Mobil\n            \n                (XOM), health insurer Cigna\n            \n                (CI), Big Pharma stock Eli Lilly\n            \n                (LLY) and defense contractor Northrop Grumman\n            \n                (NOC) even hit new all-time highs.  Stocks opened lower but were quickly off to the races after a Wall Street Journal report indicated that even though the Fed is likely to raise rates by another three-quarters of a point in November, Fed members are debating whether to signal that a smaller hike could be in the cards in December. Investors have started to become nervous that the Fed\u2019s series of unprecedentedly large rate hikes could tip the economy into recession. And apparently some at the Fed are having doubts about the pace of rate increases as well.  Reuters reported that San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly said in a speech Friday that the central bank should not create an \u201cunforced downturn\u201d for the economy with too many massive rate hikes. Long-term bond yields pulled back slightly, too, after the rate for the 10-year Treasury hit its highest level since late 2007. \u201cThe market has been looking forward to the Fed taking a break,\u201d said JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG Group North America, which owns the online brokerage firm tastyworks. \u201cI think it\u2019s the right call to let the rate hikes they\u2019ve already done play though the system a bit and see what shakes out,\u201d Kinahan added. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 surged too, rising 2.3% and 2.4% respectively. All three major market indexes are now up about 5% for the week, their biggest gains since June, and have posted solid gains for the month of October.  That\u2019s despite the fact that Snapchat\u2019s parent company\n            \n                (SNAP) plunged nearly 30% following its earnings, news that sent shares of other social media companies spiraling downward as well. Facebook owner Meta fell more than 1% and Pinterest\n            \n                (PINS) sank 6%.  Twitter\n            \n                (TWTR) also fell nearly 5%, due to reports that the Biden administration may closely scrutinize Elon Musk\u2019s other businesses for a national security reasons before allowing Musk to buy Twitter\n            \n                (TWTR). There were also reports suggesting massive layoffs ahead at Twitter\n            \n                (TWTR) if the Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) and SpaceX CEO closes the deal.",

            "text": "American Airlines expanded on its plan to drop first-class seats on its international flights and replace them with more business class seats. Some of the new seats on long-haul international flights will be dubbed \u201cFlagship Suites\u201d  and feature seats that convert into beds and doors for privacy.  The change was first disclosed last month and reiterated Thursday in a conference call with investors by Vasu Raja, the company\u2019s chief commercial officer, who said the change is in response to customer demand. \u201cThe first class will not exist \u2026 at American Airlines for the simple reason that our customers aren\u2019t buying it,\u201d he said in response to a question.  American Airlines later told CNN that Raja was referring to international flights only. \u201cThe quality of the business class seat has improved so much. And frankly, by removing [first class] we can go provide more business class seats, which is what our customers most want or are most willing to pay for,\u201d Raja said. Most planes used on domestic routes, including virtually all single-aisle jets, will continue to have the standard first class seats at the front of the planes. Although they also have more leg room and might recline more than economy seats, they don\u2019t lay flat. \u201cThis is mostly a name change. Business class at most carriers is what we would have called first class 20 years ago,\u201d said airline consultant Mike Boyd. Many planes used on international flights by American already dropped the seats designated as \u201cfirst class,\u201d instead offering business class, premium economy seats which are slightly wider than standard economy seats as well as the economy seats that fill most of the cabin. Rivals United and Delta airlines dropped the first class designation on their international flights years ago, going with with more luxurious business class offerings. Delta made the change in 1998, United did so in 2016.",

Luxury goods mogul and LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault has dumped his private jet after Twitter users took to tracking his every plane trip to make an example of how the rich and their rarefied lifestyles are polluting the environment. Arnault, 73, the world\u2019s second-richest man with a net worth of over $149 billion, said he has sold his private jet because he was Twitter-shamed over his frequent plane use. He\u2019s still flying, though, but a bit differently in hopes of evading the Twitterverse radar. \u201cIndeed, with all these stories, the group had a plane and we sold it,\u201d Arnault told an LVMH-owned radio station, on Monday. \u201cThe result now is that no one can see where I go because I rent planes when I use private planes.\u201d  Bloomberg first reported the story. The French billionaire is co-founder of the luxury goods group that owns some of the most prestigious brands in the world, including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Moet & Chandon and Givenchy Parfums. Frequent use of private jets by celebrities became a hot topic in France over the summer, with some politicians proposing to ban or tax private jets, Bloomberg reported. Arnault\u2019s oldest son offered another explanation for his dad shifting to rental planes. \u201cIt\u2019s not very good that our competitors can know where we are at any moment,\u201d Antoine Arnault told the radio station. \u201cThat can give ideas, it can also give leads, clues.\u201d Billionaires and celebrities in the US have also come under fire on social media for their constant private air travel. Elon Musk tried to pay off a 19-year-old from Florida to stop tracking his private jet use. Jack Sweeney rejected the $5,000 offer from Musk to delete the Twitter account that tracks the Musk\u2019s private jet journeys. The college freshman has developed about a dozen other flight bot accounts that track the travels of high-profile tech titans, including Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. And Kylie Jenner faced backlash on Twitter over the summer when users denounced her use of private planes for trips that sometimes were only a few minutes long. ",

            "text": "At the far southwestern tip of England, dangling into the Atlantic, the remote region of Cornwall rarely feels like the center of the world.  But recently locals have been feeling tantalizingly close as they\u2019ve watched a very special plane fly low overhead, taking off from the runway at little Newquay Airport \u2013 the 29th biggest airport in the UK \u2013 and circling the skies above the coast before touching back down.  This isn\u2019t just any plane. Nor is it a normal Boeing 747, as it appears from the ground. In fact, it\u2019s the \u201cQueen of the Skies\u201d repurposed for the space race, making trial flights before it takes part in the United Kingdom\u2019s first orbital space launch next month. And it\u2019ll be taking off from Spaceport Cornwall, which shares the airport\u2019s 1.7-mile regular runway.   Marc Andrew, from nearby Newquay, traveled to the spaceport after work to see the aircraft land this week. \u201cIt was amazing to watch, and will be a nice bit of history to tell my little boy when he\u2019s older,\u201d he told CNN. He is now preparing to return for the November launch. Cosmic Girl, as the plane has been named, is the vessel for Virgin Orbit\u2019s bid to launch seven satellites into space. A former passenger jumbo jet in service with Virgin Atlantic until 2015, it has been modified to carry LauncherOne, a California-made rocket which will go into the Earth\u2019s orbit.    Next month, Cosmic Girl will take off from Newquay\u2019s clifftop runway with LauncherOne under its wing \u2013 and once the 747 hits 34,000 feet, it\u2019ll release the rocket. Inside will be seven payloads, or satellites, which will start circling the planet in low Earth orbit. A trial last year saw the rocket \u2013 released from under the 747\u2019s left wing \u2013 traveling at up to 17,000 miles an hour as it zoomed into space.  A test flight for locals Using a 747 for a horizontal launch enables a \u201cbroader range of orbits than would be possible from a traditional ground-launched system,\u201d Virgin Orbit wrote in a statement.  The event will be the first orbital space launch for the UK and the first international launch for Virgin Orbit, according to the company. It\u2019ll also be Europe\u2019s first satellite launch, according to Ian Annett, deputy CEO at the UK Space Agency.    LauncherOne completed its first full launch rehearsal in Long Beach, California, on October 2, before being flown to the UK last Friday to meet Cosmic Girl, which arrived in Cornwall on October 11. Cosmic Girl completed a nearly three-hour test flight around Cornwall and Southwest England on October 14, with Cornwall locals noting it flying low over their gardens.    Virgin Orbit\u2019s chief pilot, Matthew Stannard, who will fly the 747 for the launch, said: \u201cIt feels amazing to bring Cosmic Girl home to the UK We are weeks away now from the first UK launch at Spaceport Cornwall so it\u2019s all very real.\u201d Melissa Thorpe, head of Spaceport Cornwall, said: \u201cSeeing the infrastructure in place makes our launch ambitions a reality.\u201d Hoping to see more Cosmic Girls? Virgin Orbit is planning to bring horizontal launches to Australia, Brazil, Japan, Poland and the Republic of Korea.",

            "title": "The US is spending billions to boost chip manufacturing. Will it be enough?",
            "text": "The United States government is pulling out all the stops to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing, injecting billions of dollars into the beleaguered sector and flexing all policy muscles available to give it a leg up over competition from Asia. When the pandemic hit in 2020, firms initially curtailed orders for these micro building blocks needed for smartphones, computers, cars and many other products. Then, as people began working from home, demand soared for information and communication technology \u2013 and the chips that power them. A chip shortage ensued, and auto plants had to stop production because they could not obtain chips. This contributed to skyrocketing new and used vehicle prices, a major driver of the painful inflation Americans were feeling. In a statement earlier this year, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo dubbed the semiconductor shortage a \u201cnational security\u201d issue because it exposed the dependency of US manufacturing on imports of semiconductors from abroad. Chips also serve critical military applications and are necessary for cybersecurity tools. The Biden administration and lawmakers rallied in response, passing the CHIPS and Science Act into law in August. The legislation includes $52 billion to strengthen semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. Of this, $39 billion is earmarked for manufacturing incentives, $13.2 billion for research and development and workforce training, and $500 million for international information communications technology security and semiconductor supply chain activities. Against that backdrop, several prominent companies have announced significant investments in US manufacturing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a powerhouse in the industry committed at least $12 billion to build a semiconductor fabrication plant in Arizona, with production expected to begin in 2024. At the start of the year, Intel said it planned to build a $20 billion semiconductor manufacturing plant in Ohio, and groundbreaking for the new chip plant took place just last month. And this month, Micron said it would invest up to $100 billion over the next two decades to build a massive semiconductor factory in upstate New York. In a flurry of tweets earlier this month President Joe Biden pledged: \u201cAmerica is going to lead the way in microchip manufacturing.\u201d  But the US has much catching up to do. US-based fabs, or chip manufacturing plants, currently only account for 12% of the world\u2019s modern semiconductor manufacturing capacity, according to data from the Semiconductor Industry Association trade group. Some 75% of the world\u2019s modern chip manufacturing is now concentrated in East Asia \u2013 a majority of that in geopolitically-vulnerable Taiwan. And even with these renewed efforts, the United States does not currently have the same talent and supply chain pipeline as some Asian markets do to support a robust homegrown industry.  To complicate matters, the surge in public and private investments comes at a questionable time, as concerns over the global chip supply shortage have eased. Pandemic-related supply chain blockages are letting up somewhat and a worsening economic outlook has hampered demand.  In an earnings call last week, TSMC CEO C.C. Wei warned it expects the \u201csemiconductor industry will likely decline\u201d in 2023. \u201cTSMC also is not immune,\u201d Wei added, but said it expects \u201cto be more resilient than the overall semiconductor industry.\u201d  Promoting semiconductor manufacturing in the United States now may risk leading to overcapacity and excess supply. And with demand weakening, it isn\u2019t immediately clear if government subsidies will be enough to overcome other obstacles the country faces in developing a competitive semiconductor manufacturing hub.  Understanding the US problems To understand the latest US efforts, it\u2019s important to be clear on where the country stands \u2013 not just in the overall chip industry, but in relation to specific, valuable pockets of it. \u201cThe US is very unlikely to increase its share of global production because even as the US brings online more fab capacity; TSMC, Intel and others are announcing fabs in other places and building them even more quickly,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  \u201cBut I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s really a huge problem,\u201d he added. He noted that measuring manufacturing based on pure output lumps together the lower-end chips and the cutting-edge, higher-end chips that are a more realistic and significant measure of chip manufacturing success. \u201cThe US does need to expand chip production for a specific kind of chips, that are directly related to American national security,\u201d he said.  The Biden administration last Friday imposed sweeping new export curbs designed to restrict China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors made with US equipment, in a move that targets the manufacturing of advanced weapons systems. While only \u201cabout 10% to 14% of chips sold [globally] come from US manufacturing facilities,\u201d according to Columbia Business School professor Dan Wang, the United States does have other strengths. \u201cIn terms of design expertise, a lot of that still resides in the U.S.\u201d  Still, the shortcomings are real. \u201cWhen it comes to foundries, which are the manufacturing side of semiconductors, the U.S. has not really been a major player for many, many years,\u201d said Wang. While it very much used to be, manufacturing began migrating to Asia during the 1980s and \u201990s, Wang said. \u201cOne of the big reasons for this is that the cost of labor is lower, and it\u2019s just far cheaper to produce at a very massive scale, integrated circuits and chips, in those parts of the world,\u201d Wang added. Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, said that it costs 50% more to manufacture chips in the U.S. than in Taiwan. Now, simply having the facilities already set up to produce or expand chip manufacturing gives Asia a big advantage. Wang said he thinks that might be why you see the U.S. \u201caxe-throwing so much money at companies to set up plants in the United States.\u201d It\u2019s not just to respond to demand and become more self-reliant, \u201cbut also because you need to get these things up and running very, very quickly, in order to even be in the race at all.\u201d  What it takes to build up a domestic chip industry Building new chip fabs itself is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. \u201cA modern fab is something like half a million square feet,\u201d said Bob Johnson, an analyst at Gartner, and requires \u201cmonstrous clean rooms that have massive air handling capabilities.\u201d He added that these massive buildings require \u201cexceptionally strong foundations.\u201d As he put it, \u201cyou cannot have any vibration in the fab because it can wreck the manufacturing process.\u201d In addition, a single extreme ultraviolet lithography machine, required to map out the circuitry of chips, costs about $150 million, and Reuters reports \u201ca cutting-edge chip plant needs 9-18 of these machines.\u201d  Moreover, the manufacturing of semiconductors requires a range of specialized inputs, including pure chemicals such as fluorinated polyimide, and etching gas,  chip etching machines, and more. In places like Taiwan and Fukuoka, Japan, supply chains have developed where the providers of these products are located close to the semiconductor factories. There are also one or two companies that produce vital inputs and that have been trustworthy suppliers to companies in Asia for a long time. This is not yet the case in places like Arizona and Ohio, where plans to build massive chip manufacturing plants are already underway. You also need a labor force willing and able to do the work. In the United States, there is both a shortage of new graduates and experienced workers with the technical and engineering knowledge necessary to manufacture semiconductors. Many of those who might have the right experience instead prefer to work in trendier industries, according to Kennedy. \u201cIf we were to today, snap our fingers and have ten new fabs with the world\u2019s leading chips, we probably wouldn\u2019t have enough people to staff them,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest bottleneck to the expansion of America\u2019s fab capacity, not capital.\u201d Intel has tried to establish close relations with Arizona State University to recruit engineers, but it is unclear whether it and other companies building fabs in America will be able to hire enough trained engineers and technicians. If not, even the billions of dollars committed by the private and public sector may not be enough to reshore semiconductor manufacturing.",

Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) announced Tuesday morning that it is combining its trading and investment banking divisions into one unit. That will streamline its operations, cutting the number of main operating lines at Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) from four to three.  The company is also folding its digital-focused consumer banking product Marcus into its wealth management business. \u201cToday, we enter the next phase of our growth, introducing a realignment of our businesses that will enable us to further capitalize on the predominant operating model of One Goldman Sachs as we better serve our clients,\u201d said Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon in a statement.  The announcement, which was previously reported on by several financial news outlets Monday, was officially announced Tuesday morning along with Goldman Sachs\u2019 latest quarterly earnings.  Goldman Sachs reported revenue of nearly $12 billion for the quarter and earnings of $3.1 billion.  Results topped forecasts, but revenue fell 12% from a year ago as the company was hit by the slowdown in the global financial markets. Deal volume dried up, with fewer companies going public and announcing big mergers. Investment banking revenue plunged 57% from a year ago. Still, shares of Goldman Sachs surged nearly 3% on the news. The company fared better than rival Morgan Stanley\n            \n                (MS), which disappointed investors when it reported its latest results Friday. ",

The Dow gained more than 550 points, or 1.9%, and moved back above 30,000. Solid results from Bank of America\n            \n                (BAC), BNY Mellon\n            \n                (BK) and Charles Schwab\n            \n                (SCHW), helped lift market sentiment. The S&P 500 surged 2.7%, and the tech heavy Nasdaq rose 3.4%. It was a broad-based rally, with every stock in the Dow finishing higher except for Walgreens\n            \n                (WBA). All eleven market sectors ended the day with gains. The three major market indexes are now up for the month of October as well.

Tech stocks got a boost Monday after gaming giant Roblox reported better-than-expected September bookings figures, a measure of sales for its virtual Robux currency. Roblox soared 20% on that news. Investors are keeping a close eye on third-quarter earnings for signs of a potential recession in the United States. Traders are also watching developments abroad, most notably in the United Kingdom. The markets were rattled last week after the British pound plunged following plans from the new Liz Truss government to cut taxes on the wealthy and businesses while also spending more on energy subsidies to help consumers dealing with surging energy costs. But UK\u2019s new finance minister Jeremy Hunt rolled back much of the tax cuts in a stunning reversal Monday. The pound rebounded on that news, helping to lift stocks in the process.",

            "title": "Tesla investors try to look past Elon Musk\u2019s many, many distractions",
            "text": "Elon Musk now wants to buy Twitter after all. While that\u2019s good news for Twitter\u2019s long-suffering shareholders, Tesla investors hope he still has some time for them. They need a little help, too. Sure, Musk still has many fans on Wall Street and behind the wheel. But some are growing tired of how the world\u2019s richest person can\u2019t focus more on the company that has provided him with the bulk of his wealth.  Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) reports earnings after the close on Wednesday. Shares are down more than 35% this year amid concerns about the fact that Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) recently reported weaker production and delivery numbers than expected for the third quarter. Wall Street still expects extremely strong sales and earnings growth, with consensus forecasts calling for a more than a 60% jump in revenue and profit. But analysts have been trimming those estimates in the past few weeks.  That\u2019s partly due to the fact that Tesla faces growing competition in the United States from the likes of GM\n            \n                (GM), Ford\n            \n                (F), Volkswagen\n            \n                (VLKAF) and other electric vehicle upstarts such as Rivian and Lucid.  There are big challenges in China as well, with Tesla going up against homegrown EV rivals like Nio\n            \n                (NIO), Xpeng and Li Auto. There\u2019s also BYD, a Chinese auto firm backed by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKB). To be fair, the entire auto sector is struggling this year due to growing worries about a global recession, surging energy prices and, of course, brutal competition.  All the major US, European and Japanese car maker stocks are down about 20% to 45% this year. And shares of the pure play EV companies (both in the US and China) have each plunged about 60% to 80% in 2022. Too many distractions Gary Black, managing partner at the Future Fund and a Tesla shareholder, has been tweeting for the past few weeks that concerns about Twitter are a headache for Tesla investors. In one tweet, Black said there are several problems for Tesla due to Twitter. Two of the biggest? The overhang from an eventual Tesla stock sale by Musk to finance the deal and the distraction for Musk, especially since \u201cElon\u2019s core competency is engineering/tech\u201d and Twitter is more of an ad-driven media business.  Tesla also has no chief operating officer. That means Musk has to take a hands-on approach at Tesla while also being distracted by his numerous other pursuits, such as SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink and potentially Twitter\n            \n                (TWTR).  The underwhelming deliveries and production numbers also underscore how a slowing global economy (and possible recession) could hurt Tesla.  \u201cAre we sure the problem is only supply and not (partially) related to demand?\u201d asked Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a recent report.  Jonas added, saying it \u201cwould be unreasonable to assume\u201d that the company can keep raising prices without demand suffering, especially if the economy is slowing.  Demand could also take a hit as Tesla faces even more competition in the US. \u201cTo enhance its competitive position, Tesla will need to expand its range of products to contend with a substantially higher number of models from established global automakers and start-ups by the end of 2025,\u201d said analysts at S&P Global Ratings in a recent report. The S&P analysts are confident Musk can pull this off. They even recently upgraded their credit rating on Tesla. But they conceded that it won\u2019t be easy. The margin of error is slim. S&P estimates the number of electric vehicle models available in North America will exceed 100 by 2026, more than four times current levels. \u201cOver the next 3-5 years, a few of these could become formidable competitors for Tesla,\u201d the analysts said.  Streaming meltdown Netflix investors know a thing or two about what can happen when a market you were once the clear leader in goes mainstream. Shares of the streaming giant have plunged more than 60% in 2022, making it one of the worst performers in the S&P 500. The company will report third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, and investors will be watching to see if Netflix\n            \n                (NFLX) is able to stem the bleeding after losing subscribers in each of the first two quarters.  Netflix\u2019s woes have led the company to do what was previously unthinkable: announce plans last Thursday for a cheaper subscription plan supported by advertising. Netflix will launch the ad-based version (also known as old-fashioned television) in November. It\u2019s a bold decision that may not pan out. \u201cWe see the move to offer an ad supported tier by the global streaming incumbent player as defensive not offensive and fraught with\u2026risk that continues to be underappreciated,\u201d said Jeffrey Wlodarczak, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group who has a \u201csell\u201d rating on the stock. Recession worries are leading many consumers to cut back on how much they plan to spend on streaming services, of which there are now legion. That\u2019s bad news in particular for Netflix. Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan, who also has a \u201csell\u201d on Netflix, said in a report that he remains \u201cconcerned that additional subscriber offerings could cause \u2018spin down\u2019 into the lowest priced plans by users in any potential consumer recession over the next 6-12 months.\u201d In other words, users ditch the more expensive plans for less profitable, cheaper subscriptions.  What\u2019s more, Netflix is no longer the only streaming game that is struggling. Shares of Disney\n            \n                (DIS), which also has an ad-based version for Disney\n            \n                (DIS)+ coming soon, are down nearly 40% this year.  In addition to Netflix and Disney+, there is also Disney-controlled Hulu, Amazon\u2019s\n            \n                (AMZN) Prime Video, Apple\n            \n                (AAPL) TV+, Peacock, Paramount+ and HBO Max. (CNN parent Warner Bros. Discovery owns HBO Max.) Economic slowdown jitters have hit the entire media sector hard, as investors worry that consumers will balk at paying for more monthly subscriptions and corporate advertising budgets will also dry up.  Shares of Peacock owner Comcast\n            \n                (CMCSA), Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery are all down about 40% to 50% this year.

Flight 1930, on a Boeing 737-900, was bound for Miami International Airport.  \u201cThe aircraft landed safely and passengers deplaned at the gate,\u201d United Airlines said in a statement. The airline didn\u2019t provide details of any potential damage to the plane. Kimberly Fiock was on the flight Friday morning with her husband. \u201cI knew something was wrong because there was fire below the wing that kept coming out in spurts, and it felt like the plane was kind of jerking,\u201d Fiock told CNN. \u201cWe could hear the pops of the engine trying to start and see the fire on our side since we were right by the wing. The lights kept flickering, too, when it would pop. I was just hoping we would be able to land safely!\u201d Fiock said she didn\u2019t realize a bird strike had caused the problem until after the plane landed. \u201cThe pilots did a great job getting us back safely, and I\u2019m so grateful to them and the crew,\u201d she said. Flight tracking site FlightAware shows that Flight 1930 took off at 10:47 a.m. local time and returned to O\u2019Hare 42 minutes later. A new aircraft was assigned to the flight, the airline said, and it departed early Friday afternoon. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, there were more than 17,000 wildlife strikes at 753 US airports in 2019. Engines are the most frequently damaged component of civil aircraft in the US, according to the FAA, accounting for about a quarter of all damaged aircraft components. The FAA has a Wildlife Strike Database tracking such incidents. The number of wildlife strikes with aircraft is on the rise, the FAA says on its wildlife site. Strikes have increased steadily from about 1,800 in 1990 to 16,000 in 2018, the FAA website says.  \u201cExpanding wildlife populations, increases in number of aircraft movements, a trend toward faster and quieter aircraft, and outreach to the aviation community all have contributed to the observed increase in reported wildlife strikes,\u201d the FAA site says. In 2009, pilot Chesley B. \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger III famously landed US Airways Flight 1549 on New York\u2019s Hudson River after a double bird strike took out the plane\u2019s twin engines.

            "text": "So much for a sleepy Columbus Day on Wall Street. Stocks weren\u2019t doing much Monday morning but took a turn lower in the afternoon following stark comments from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who warned that the United States is likely to enter a recession within the next six to nine months. Dimon made the comments in an exclusive interview with CNBC that aired Monday.  \u201cYou can\u2019t talk about the economy without talking about stuff in the future\u2026and this is serious stuff,\u201d Dimon said in the CNBC interview. He added that he thinks Europe is in a recession already and that the US is probably next. The Dow fell more than 200 points shortly after Dimon\u2019s comments aired before rebounding to end the trading day down nearly 95 points, or 0.3%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were each down sharply midday but also bounced off their lows. The S&P 500 closed with a 0.8% loss while the Nasdaq dropped 1%. Shares of JPMorgan Chase\n            \n                (JPM), which is one of the 30 stocks in the Dow, were down nearly 1%. JPMorgan Chase\n            \n                (JPM) is one of several big banks that will report earnings on Friday.  Stocks have tumbled this year due to worries about inflation and how the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive interest rate hikes to fight surging prices may eventually lead to a recession. Stocks soared early last week, leading to hopes that the market had bottomed.  But sellers have returned with a vengeance in the past few days. Friday\u2019s mostly solid jobs report did little to dispel fears about more big rate hikes from the Fed. The Nasdaq hit a new 52-week low Monday. The Dow and S&P 500 are not far from their lows either. The Dow is down about 20% this year and is back in a bear market along with the other two major market indexes. The bond market was closed Monday, but yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury are currently hovering around 3.89%. The 10-year yield, which heavily influences the direction of mortgage rates, briefly topped 4% late last month and hit its highest level since October 2008. Fed vice chair Lael Brainard alluded to challenges in the housing market in a speech Monday. Brainard noted that \u201cthe moderation in demand due to monetary policy tightening is only partly realized so far\u201d and that \u201cthe transmission of tighter policy is most evident in highly interest-sensitive sectors like housing.\u201d Brainard also warned that \u201cin other sectors, lags in transmission mean that policy actions to date will have their full effect on activity in coming quarters.\u201d In other words, the rest of the economy could soon slow.",

            "text": "The trial of two of France\u2019s biggest companies began Monday over the crash of Air France flight 447 in 2009 that killed 228 passengers and crew.  The national flag carrier and Toulouse-based Airbus\n            \n                (EADSF) have been charged with involuntary homicide for their part in the disaster over the Atlantic. Both companies were placed under official examination in 2011 for similar charges by prosecutors trying to determine responsibility for the crash. But those charges were dropped in 2019 after eight years of judicial scrutiny. Now, owing in large part to pressure from families and friends of the victims, they are back in court. Air France denied the company was responsible for the crash and said the charges should again be dismissed.  \u201cAir France will continue to maintain, as it has always done, that it did not commit any criminal fault at the origin of this accident and will therefore plead for acquittal,\u201d Claudia Chemarin, a lawyer for the airline, said in a statement to CNN. Airbus gave a similar statement to French newspaper La Tribune.  If convicted, the companies each face a fine of 225,000 euros ($219,000).   There was mystery surrounding the crash of the flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris from the outset. For one thing, most fatal aircraft accidents happen on take-off or landing: this disaster occurred mid-flight. Then there was the debris. When searchers first found parts of the plane floating in the South Atlantic 400 miles northeast of the Brazilian coast they were in a relatively confined area. A catastrophic loss of cabin pressure, or a bomb, would have scattered debris over miles of the ocean.   The first recovered parts of the plane added to the mystery. Many, like the shelves from the galley, showed evidence of damage from what experts called \u201cdownward compression.\u201d  That is, the plane hit the water seemingly flat with extreme downward force, as if it had pancaked onto the water with little forward motion.   That is what accident investigators eventually concluded had happened. France\u2019s Bureau d\u2019Enqu\u00eates et d\u2019Analyses (BEA), which investigates aircraft accidents, found in 2012 that the plane was falling more than 10,000 feet per minute when it hit the ocean but had a forward ground speed of just 107 knots, about 123 miles an hour, well below the stall speed of the Airbus A330. BAE\u2019s accident investigators concluded that the initial cause of the crash was icing on devices called pitot tubes, sensors that are crucial to determining an aircraft\u2019s speed and attitude. It was a problem that had affected a few Airbus aircraft in the past, but one which the company had not corrected. The investigators found that once the sensors failed, the autopilot disengaged and the cockpit crew lost reliable readouts of flight data. Because the senior pilot on board was on a rest break, the two, more junior co-pilots took over, flying the plane manually. Within seconds, one of the two at the controls pitched the nose upward, apparently to gain altitude, but inadvertently put the A330 into a high-altitude stall. Without sufficient forward speed, the Airbus began dropping like a stone. The two co-pilots signaled the senior pilot to come assist. But from the cockpit voice recordings, it is evident that without visual references in the pitch-black night, with unreliable instruments, none of the three understood exactly why the plane was falling. For four minutes, as the plane plummeted downward from nearly 40,000 feet to the sea, the three tried desperately to figure out what was going wrong and what to do about it. The charges against Airbus center on its failure to correct the known problem with the pitot tubes. Air France stands accused of failing to train pilots on how to respond to the kind of situation the crew faced.  \u201cTo say today that only the pilots are at fault is too easy, it is very exaggerated and therefore it is not the truth,\u201d Philippe Linguet, who lost his brother in the crash, told CNN on Friday.   \u201cWe want to confront the accused with their faults and if the court recognizes these faults, the accused Airbus and Air France should be condemned,\u201d he added.  The trial is expected last until early December. \u2014 Pierre Bairin contributed to this article. ",

            "title": "Tesla set to deliver long-delayed electric trucks to Pepsi in December",
            "text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Thursday that production of its Semi truck has begun, and deliveries to one customer, Pepsi, will occur in December. Pepsi said in a statement Friday that the trucks will support its Frito-Lay plant in Modesto California, and its Pepsi beverage plant in Sacramento. Neither Musk nor Pepsi said how many trucks would be delivered. \u201cWe are looking forward to this next step in our PepsiCo Positive journey and will provide more details once we have taken delivery,\u201d PepsiCo spokesperson Andrea Foote said, referring to the company\u2019s sustainability efforts. Tesla first announced the Semi in November 2017 and production was said to begin in 2019. Companies like Walmart, FedEx, Anheuser-Busch, City Furniture and J.B. Hunt Transport Services have claimed they have made reservations. Production delays are common at Tesla. Its Cybertruck production was announced to begin in 2021 but has been pushed back to next year, and the second generation of Tesla Roadster, which was originally announced at the same event as the Semi, was supposed to go into production in 2020, but that has been pushed back to 2023 at the earliest. Musk reiterated Thursday that the Semi will have a range of 500 miles. Electric trucks are well-suited for some routes, but their heavy weight compared to diesel and fuel cell trucks can force businesses to scale back heavy loads. Musk made the announcement following the news Tuesday that he\u2019s revived his original proposal to buy Twitter for $44 billion. Musk had previously attempted to terminate the deal last month, claiming Twitter violated the agreement by misrepresenting the number of spam and fake bot accounts on the social media platform.  Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, has sold about $15 billion in Tesla stock this year, but it\u2019s still not clear if Musk has sufficient liquid funds to close the Twitter deal. Musk, who has received commitments for debt and equity financing, may need to sell additional shares of Tesla to finance the purchase. He could also sell shares of SpaceX, borrow against his holdings in Tesla or SpaceX, or raise money from other investors. Any borrowings to finance the deal have gotten much more expensive recently, however, as interest rates have risen. Musk\u2019s text messages from earlier this year, which were revealed recently during an ongoing legal battle with Twitter, showed conversations to raise billions from wealthy contacts of his, including Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.  Musk\u2019s Semi truck announcement did not immediately jolt Tesla stock higher. Tesla shares fell roughly 5% in trading Friday morning.  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment and generally does not engage with the professional news media. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore contributed to this report.",

            "text": "Tyson Foods is the latest company closing its Chicago-area offices, joining Boeing, Caterpillar and Citadel among others. The poultry producer said Wednesday that it\u2019s bringing together its corporate employees at its global headquarters in Arkansas, resulting in the closure of three offices, including downtown Chicago, Downers Grove, Illinois, and Dakota Dunes in South Dakota. Roughly 1,000 employees work in the three offices and will begin relocation in early next year. \u201cBringing our talented corporate team members and businesses together under one roof unlocks greater opportunities to share perspectives and ideas, while also enabling us to act quickly to solve problems and provide the innovative products solutions that our customers deserve and value,\u201d said CEO Donnie King in a release. Tyson\u2019s move serves another blow for Chicago\u2019s image. McDonald\u2019s, which has its headquarters there, criticized the city for crime. CEO Chris Kempczinski recently said that crime is \u201cseeping into every corner of our city\u201d and he said that he\u2019s frequently asked \u201cwhat\u2019s going on in Chicago?\u201d \u201cWe have violent crime that\u2019s happening in our restaurants \u2026 we\u2019re seeing homelessness issues in our restaurants. We\u2019re having drug overdoses that are happening in our restaurants,\u201d he said last month at the Economic Club of Chicago. \u201cSo we see in our restaurants, every single day, what\u2019s happening in society at large.\u201d He said it\u2019s difficult to recruit people to work at the company\u2019s headquarters, noting: \u201cOne of the things that I hear from our employees [is] \u2026 \u2018I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s safe to come downtown.\u2019\u201d McDonald\u2019s said it\u2019s staying in Chicago, but other companies that are leaving the city have been less forthcoming about their reasons. In an email to CNN, Tyson said the move out of Chicago was not related to crime. Boeing\n            \n                (BA) said in May it was leaving Chicago for Washington, DC, The company didn\u2019t blame crime. Analysts said the change signaled it has lost the commercial race to Airbus and wants to be seen as primarily a defense and space contractor. Boeing\n            \n                (BA) used to be based in Seattle from its founding in 1916 to 2001. Caterpillar and Citadel also recently announced moves out of Chicago to different locations outside Illinois. Caterpillar was based in Deerfield, a suburb of the city. However, Kellogg said in June that its newly formed cereal and plant-based food companies will be headquartered in Chicago. Tyson has had a rocky year because of inflation. It recently said that \u201cdemand for chicken is extremely strong,\u201d while demand for its higher-priced cuts of beef has softened. Average sales price for chicken grew during its latest quarter, while the average price for beef and pork fell as consumers balked at some premium cuts.  Consumer demand for meat remained strong, Tyson said, but consumers are shifting between meats because of inflation. The company plans to launch new lower-priced options and also add new larger package sizes for consumers searching for value. Shares of Tyson are down about 25% for the year. Update: This story has been updated to clarify Caterpillar\u2019s headquarters was in a Chicago suburb. \u2013 CNN Business\u2019 Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.",

The USS Gerald Ford is the first new aircraft carrier designed in \u201cover 40 years,\u201d according to the US Navy. The carrier\u2019s construction formally began in November 2009 and it was commissioned in 2017 by former President Donald Trump, according to a US Navy release. The ship is the first Ford-class aircraft carrier. The Navy has begun construction on the next two Ford-class carriers, the USS Kennedy and the USS Enterprise.  The aircraft carrier has new, advanced technology including \u201cnearly three times the amount of electrical power,\u201d compared to the Nimitz-class carriers and uses the electromagnetic aircraft launch system, or EMALS, according to the Navy.  The EMALS system uses electric power to launch aircraft off the vessel instead of the previous steam catapult system. The system puts less stress on the aircraft as they are launched from the carrier and will allow for less time between launches, a Navy official said. The carrier also has dual band radar, which is a more advanced radar system. It is the only forward-class carrier that will have this kind of radar, the official said. The USS Gerald Ford and the carrier strike group will operate with allies and partners in both the 2nd and 6th fleet areas of responsibility in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea, a US Navy official said. The deployment will be shorter than a standard six-month deployment, the official added.  \u201cThis deployment is an opportunity to push the ball further down the field and demonstrate the advantage that Ford and Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 8 bring to the future of naval aviation, to the region and to our allies and partners,\u201d Carrier Strike Group 12 Commander Rear Adm. Gregory Huffman said in a statement.  The deployment will involve \u201capproximately 9,000 personnel from nine nations, 20 ships and 60 aircraft,\u201d a US Navy release said. The nations participating in the exercise include the US, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden, the release added. While the USS Gerald Ford deployed Tuesday, the other ships in the carrier strike group will leave to join the Ford on Wednesday, a second Navy official said. This is common for these deployments.",

            "text": "Micron on Tuesday said it would invest up to $100 billion over the next two decades to build a massive semiconductor factory in upstate New York. The move comes in the wake of US government efforts to boost domestic chip production.   The Idaho-based firm said it plans to build the \u201clargest semiconductor fabrication facility in the history of the United States\u201d in Clay, New York. Micron said the new facility, about 15 miles from Syracuse, will create nearly 50,000 New York jobs over the next two decades.  The initial investment of $20 billion is planned \u201cby the end of this decade,\u201d the company said. Site preparation work will start in 2023, with construction slated to begin in 2024 and production output expected to \u201cramp up in the latter half of the decade, gradually increasing in line with industry demand trends,\u201d according to the company. Shares for Micron rose nearly 5% Tuesday after the news was announced.  In August, President Joe Biden signed into law the CHIPS and Science Act, which aimed to boost American chip manufacturing with a more than $200 billion investment over the next five years. The package included some $52 billion for chip manufacturing and research, providing companies incentives to build, expand and modernize US facilities and equipment. The legislation aimed to lessen a US dependency on offshore chip production from Asia, and came in the wake of a global shortage of these building blocks required for smartphones, autos and computers.  In a statement Tuesday, Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said he is \u201cgrateful to President Biden and his Administration for making the CHIPS and science Act a priority.\u201d  \u201cThis historic leading-edge memory megafab in Central New York will deliver benefits beyond the semiconductor industry by strengthening U.S. technology leadership as well as economic and national security, driving American innovation and competitiveness for decades to come,\u201d Mehrotra added. (A fab refers to a semiconductor fabrication plant).  The company said that the $5.5 billion in incentives from the state of New York over the life of the project, alongside anticipated federal grants and tax credits from the CHIPS and Science Act, \u201care critical to support hiring and capital investment.\u201d New York Governor Kathy Hochul touted Micron\u2019s investment in a statement, saying it \u201cmarks the start of something transformative in scale and possibility for our state\u2019s economic future.\u201d She added that this investment, which is the largest private-sector investment in state history, will help \u201cusher the state into another Industrial Revolution.\u201d Getting new semiconductor factories up and running in the US can take years. Ahead of the CHIPS legislation, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company committed at least $12 billion to build a semiconductor fabrication plant in Arizona, with production expected to begin in 2024.  Intel announced plans to build a $20 billion semiconductor manufacturing plant in Ohio at the beginning of the year, but then warned that this project could be delayed if lawmakers did not pass the CHIPS legislation. Groundbreaking for the new Intel chip plant took place just last month. Biden traveled to Ohio to celebrate the occasion. ",

Nike\n            \n                (NKE) said Thursday its inventory levels soared 65% in North America, its largest market, and 44% overall last quarter from a year ago. After navigating limited supply in 2021 Nike is now carrying far too much product, particularly when it comes to clothing.  \u201cWe effectively have a few seasons landing in the marketplace at the same time,\u201d creating a glut, Nike CEO John Donahoe said on a call with analysts Thursday. Donahoe explained that when Nike factories in Vietnam and Indonesia had to close after Covid-19 outbreaks, goods arrived late for this year\u2019s spring, summer and fall seasons. Then Nike\u2019s upcoming holiday season orders arrived earlier than planned. Meanwhile, the brand still has merchandise orders in transit. Nike will discount items to move them, and those promotions will weigh on its profitability for the coming quarters, he added. Nike\u2019s stock tumbled 11% during afternoon trading Friday.  Investors also are worried about other athletic companies\u2019 inventory, Under Armour\n            \n                (UA), Adidas\n            \n                (ADDDF), Dick\u2019s\n            \n                (DKS) and other athletic companies all fell sharply Friday as well on the Nike news.  To unload goods that are now out of season and shift to the appropriate holiday selection, Nike will move more clothing to its own factory stores, promote online and sell more to discount stores such as TJ Maxx. Nike in recent years has been pulling back on selling products to other retailers. Sending its goods to discount chains is a last resort. \u201cWe are taking decisive action to clear excess inventory, focusing on specific pockets of seasonally late products, predominantly in apparel,\u201d Donahoe said. Inventory glut has been an issue across retail companies, with Target\n            \n                (TGT), Walmart\n            \n                (WMT) and others saying in recent weeks that they expect the upcoming shopping season to be packed with discounts. This year, retailers seriously misjudged what\u2019s in demand and are sitting on too much casual clothing, home goods, electronics and other non-essentials. But the level of Nike\u2019s excess inventory was not expected. \u201cThe surprise of the quarter was the magnitude of promotional activity needed to move through excess apparel,\u201d Lorraine Hutchinson, an analyst at Bank of America, said in a note to clients Friday. Despite the inventory glut, Nike did have some positive news to share: Demand remained strong, especially for sneakers, even in the face of high inflation. Overall, Nike\u2019s sales jumped 4% last quarter from the same period a year ago. \u201cWe see strong consumer demand in North America currently,\u201d Donahoe said. \u201cThere\u2019s no signs of any softness.\u201d",

There are Emirates-specific details too, like the illuminated emergency exit signs in English and Arabic.   For full-on avgeeks there are items such as baby bassinets, flashlights and latches to hold galley trolleys in place. And if regular airplane fittings are not quite chic enough for you, there\u2019s an arty option too. Some of the items, such as engine blades, have been painted by contemporary artists to make them works of art in themselves; others, such as surfboards and skateboards, have no visible link to the plane, but have been created from the A380\u2019s raw materials.   Many of the items, like these airframe door stops, include nuggets of behind-the-scenes information.  Estimated prices start at around $80 for an emergency exit sign. Looking for the way? Drop on over to the auction website to see the listings for days one, two and three. ",

            "text": "The world\u2019s first all-electric passenger aircraft has successfully taken to the sky. Israeli-founded company Eviation Aircraft successfully launched the Alice on Tuesday morning from Washington\u2019s Grant County International Airport. The zero-emission plane traveled at an altitude of 3,500 feet for its eight-minute inaugural flight.  \u201cThis is history,\u201d Gregory Davis, Eviation\u2019s president and CEO, told CNN Business.\u201dWe have not seen the propulsion technology change on the aircraft since we went from the piston engine to the turbine engine. It was the 1950s that was the last time you saw an entirely new technology like this come together.\u201d With battery technology similar to that of an electric car or a cell phone and 30 minutes of charging, the nine-passenger Alice will be able to fly for one hour to two hours. Based on today\u2019s battery technology, Eviation is targeting a range of 250 nautical miles. As recently as April, Eviation had said the Alice would be able to fly about 440 nautical miles. The plane has a max cruise speed of 250 knots, or 287 miles per hour. For reference, a Boeing 737 has a max cruise speed of 588 miles per hour. Eviation was founded in 2015 and has been pushing the Alice forward ever since. The company hopes to use the information gathered during Tuesday\u2019s flight to review next steps and deliver aircrafts to customers by 2027 \u2014 though Eviation warns that plan is subject to change. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually generated, frankly, terabytes of data with the data acquisition systems that we had on the aircraft, so we\u2019re going to take a couple of weeks actually and review it to see how the aircraft performs versus our models and our analysis,\u201d Davis said. \u201cFrom there, we\u2019ll understand what we need to do next.\u201d  The company says it expects to be working on developing an FAA-certified aircraft through 2025 followed by a year or two of flight testing before it can deliver Alices to customers. Eviation is currently targeting entering the Alice into service by 2027. Three different versions of the Alice are in protoype stages:  a \u201ccommuter\u201d variant, an executive version, and one specialized for cargo. The commuter configuration holds nine passengers and two pilots, as well as 850 pounds of cargo. The executive design has six passenger seats for a more spacious flight, and the cargo plane holds 450 cubic feet of volume. But the Alice\u2019s journey toward take-off has not been without issue. Plagued with delays, the Alice was originally expected to fly in 2021. Eviation faced executive turnover and a series of weather issues that hindered testing progress, pushing back take-off dates and announced fleet launches by years. Commuter airline CapeAir expected to put a fleet into service by 2023, serving routes across Boston and Cape Cod, but the purchased Alices have faced delay. DHL and Miami-based air charter company GlobalX have also announced plans to buy the plane. ",

            "text": "Semiconductors are in everything. Our phones, our laptops, our televisions. Even our cars. But concerns about a global recession and continued worries about supply shortages stemming from lingering pandemic-related shutdowns in Asia over the past two years are hurting top chip companies.  Shares of Intel\n            \n                (INTC) are down more than 45% this year, making it the biggest dog of the Dow. Intel\n            \n                (INTC) is struggling despite well-publicized plans to build more plants in the United States and hire more at home. President Biden even just toured the new Intel\n            \n                (INTC) facility in Ohio for its groundbreaking ceremony.  To be fair, Intel is not the only chip company that\u2019s having a tough time this year.  Shares of semiconductor rivals Nvidia\n            \n                (NVDA) and AMD\n            \n                (AMD) have both plunged more than 50%. The supply chain woes and fears of about a rapidly slowing economy are weighing on the entire sector. The benchmark Philadelphia Semiconductor Index\n            \n                (SOX), or SOX as it is known on Wall Street, is down nearly 40% in 2022. But Intel has been a laggard for longer. Shares are now trading at their lowest level since May 2016. The stock is down more than 25% in the past five years while the SOX has more than doubled, Nvidia is up nearly 200% and AMD has soared more than 400%.  Can newish CEO Pat Gelsinger (he took over in 2021) turn Intel around? Investors may give Gelsinger more time to get the company back on track.  How much time is unclear though. Gelsinger\u2019s predecessor, Bob Swan, was CEO for only a little more than two years. Swan took over for Brian Krzanich, who stepped down in 2018 after disclosing a \u201c\u2018past consensual relationship\u201d with an Intel employee. One fund manager who owns the stock thinks Gelsinger will be able to return Intel to its former glory. But he said it will take time and that investors don\u2019t need to rush into the stock just yet. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a sense of urgency to buy. But longer-term, I think Intel will right the ship,\u201d said Jeff Travis, portfolio manager of Oak Associates Funds. Travis owns Intel in the Red Oak Technology Select fund. Travis does think that semiconductor stocks are still a good \u201csecular growth industry\u201d and that valuations are now attractive given how sharply the stocks have fallen. He said that chip equipment companies KLA and Kulicke and Soffa\n            \n                (KLIC), which sell products to major semiconductor manufacturers, and Ambarella\n            \n                (AMBA), whose video processing chips are used in cars, are top picks.  So is the worst over for these and other semiconductor companies? Goldman Sachs analysts don\u2019t think so. They cut their revenue and earnings estimates on Friday for memory chip leaders Micron\n            \n                (MU), which will report earnings on Thursday, and Western Digital\n            \n                (WDC). \u201cThere have been a string of negative industry data points,\u201d the analysts noted, pointing to cautious comments about demand from Intel, AMD and Nvidia in recent weeks. The Goldman analysts added that there is \u201cweakness across the PC, enterprise server, and smartphone end-markets.\u201d So it may be soon to call a bottom for the major chip companies just yet.  Shocktober or Rocktober for stocks? September is historically the worst month for the stock market. This September is proving to be no exception. The Dow has plunged more than 6% so far this month and is not far from a 52-week low. That follows a more than a 4% drop in August. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have fared even worse, plummeting 7% and 8% respectively.  Could the market bounce back in October, though? Sure, the month that ends with Halloween has a bad reputation for being a scary one for traders. Wall Street has had some historic plunges in October. Think 1929, 1987 and 2008 for example.  But these massive October sell-offs are actually anomalies. Stocks often enjoy strong year-end rallies, as investors bet on healthy earnings growth and strong consumer spending during the holidays. Retail sales have been rising lately, boosted by a big drop in gas and oil prices helping to put more money in consumers\u2019 pockets. So there are hopes that Americans will keep shopping, especially since the job market remains strong as well. That should boost corporate profits. Still, turmoil in global markets, particularly due to inflation, is leading blue chip companies like FedEx\n            \n                (FDX) to issue warnings about their earnings and the economy.  Most major corporations will report earnings for the third quarter in October\u2026and that means they may also give updated outlooks for the fourth quarter and provide some first glimpses about what they are expecting for sales and profits in 2023.  Analysts have already cut their forecasts for the third quarter pretty substantially in the past few weeks. According to data from FactSet, Wall Street now is predicting earnings growth of just 3.2% for the third quarter. If they need to start slashing estimates for the end of this year and next year as well, that could push stocks even lower. \u201cThere is more downside risk for US stocks,\u201d said Luke Tilley, chief economist and head of asset allocation and quantitative services for Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors.

Depending on your hemisphere, the autumn or spring equinox has just passed (here\u2019s the science on that), but if you\u2019re not digging the pumpkin spice or cool nights, there\u2019s always the option to jet across the globe.  Here\u2019s this week\u2019s travel news so you can start planning.   Aviation highs and lows It was a good week for Qatar Airways, which was named the world\u2019s favorite airline at the Skytrax World Airline Awards, and also for Air New Zealand, which launched the first direct flight between Auckland and New York.  However, a study released Wednesday revealed that airline passenger satisfaction is taking a dive in North America, and one East Coast airport is leaving customers unhappier than most.  That same airport (alright, it\u2019s Newark!) was the worst US airport for cancellations this summer, but if you want to know who was in the bad books globally, look to Canada for the world leaders in delays.  A regional US airline\u2019s controversial proposal to tackle the global pilot shortage by cutting the hours it takes to become a co-pilot was slapped down by the Federal Aviation Administration on Monday. And Southwest Airlines pulled an outrageous move when it surprised a flight full of Hawaii-bound passengers by handing out ukuleles for all and imposing an impromptu beginners\u2019 lesson. Yes, you heard us right. Train company Amtrak was quick to troll the airline on Twitter.  Unlocking Asia At the World Airline Awards on Friday, Skytrax CEO Edward Plaisted told the audience that the industry was being buoyed by the \u201cpent-up demand for travel\u201d but that we now \u201cjust need to see a few more borders opening.\u201d  In Asia, the most cautious continent when it comes to Covid-19 policies, that\u2019s finally beginning to happen. Japan has set a date to reopen to mass tourism next month, and on September 26, Hong Kong will remove international quarantine after more than two years.  The central Asian nation of Bhutan reopened on September 23, and news also came this week that China is considering easing entry rules for some foreign tourists.

Here are some of the most beautiful. If paradise islands surrounded by azure waters are your thing \u2013 and who among us can say they aren\u2019t \u2013 you might be glad to hear that the South Pacific archipelago of Fiji and the dual-island nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis have both moved down to the \u201cmoderate\u201d risk category on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s travel advisories list.

It\u2019s spawned hops-loving events around the world, but in Malaysia, religious groups are calling for a ban.   There was a dramatic rise in demand for flights out of Moscow on Wednesday. Many Russians were keen to flee the \u201cpartial mobilization\u201d of the country\u2019s citizens.  A flight attendant was punched by a passenger on a flight from Mexico to Los Angeles.

In much of the northern hemisphere, the busy summer season was beset by delays and cancellations, while in the United States a new study this week found that airplane passenger satisfaction is declining across the board.  Still, as we roll into the calmer travel months of September and October, there was cause of celebration in London on Friday, as the industry\u2019s leaders gathered at the Langham Hotel for the Skytrax World Airline Awards 2022 \u2013 the first time the event had been held in person since 2019. Skytrax, a UK-based airline and airport review and ranking site, conducted more than 14 million customer surveys in more than 100 countries between September 2021 to August 2022 to find out the world\u2019s current favorite airline.  This year\u2019s winner was no stranger to the podium. The newly crowned Qatar Airways has won the top prize a total of seven times since the awards were introduced in 1999. The Qatari flag-carrier also scooped up eight more gongs on Friday, including Best Business Class, Best Business Class Seat and Best Business Class Lounge Dining. That\u2019s going to be a lot to bring back through hand luggage.   Just two months ago, the carrier took the No.1 slot in AirlineRatings.com\u2019s ranking of the world\u2019s best airlines.  Qatar Airways group chief executive, Akbar Al Baker, thanked his \u201cincredible employees\u201d for \u201ctheir continued dedication and drive\u201d and said that \u201cto win these awards in the same year that we celebrate our 25th anniversary is even more rewarding.\u201d  Shortly after receiving the award, he told CNN Travel the secret of the airline\u2019s sustained success was: \u201cConsistent service, consistent product, consistent attention to passengers and absolute dedication from everyone that works in the airline.\u201d Singapore Airlines, the world\u2019s new No. 2 carrier according to Skytrax\u2019s survey, also won nine awards, including Best Cabin Staff, Best First Class, Best First Class Seat and Best First Class Catering.  Ryanair\u2019s surprise  UAE flag-carrier Emirates was in third place, and was also awarded for Best Inflight Entertainment, Best Economy Class, Best Economy Class Catering and Best Premium Economy Class Seat.  Japan\u2019s ANA (All Nippon Airways) came in at No.4 and was also named World\u2019s Cleanest Airline: no mean feat when two years of Covid-19 have meant customers are particularly mindful of hygiene and cleanliness standards. It won four more awards besides, including Best Airport Services.  Australian airline Qantas came in fifth in the survey of more than 350 airlines, conducted in English, French, Spanish, Russian, Japanese and Chinese languages.  Delta Air Lines was the leading airline in the US, winning six region-specific awards categories, while Turkish Airlines was the top carrier in Europe, taking home four awards including the highly competitive Best Airline in Europe title.  In one of the biggest shake-ups of the day, Irish airline Ryanair \u2013 never afraid of courting controversy in its 37-year history \u2013 triumphed at the awards for the first time, claiming the crown for Best Low-Cost Airline in Europe. This success with customers must in large part be owed to it emerging this summer as one of the region\u2019s more reliable airlines, canceling relatively few flights and even offering \u201crescue\u201d flights in July and August to help people stranded by cancellations by their competitors.  Albertine Murasira, a flight attendant for RwandAir, which won best airline staff service in Africa, said the award would encourage the carrier to further raise standards. As it\u2019s an award for \u201cbest employees, this is a very big win for us,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s going to encourage us to keep taking care of our passengers.\u201d  Edward Plaisted, Skytrax CEO, said that while the awards celebrated the best of aviation, the industry was still tackling the strain of Covid, staffing shortages and fuel price surges caused by the conflict in Ukraine.  \u201cAll in all it\u2019s not been the happiest times in many respects,\u201d he told the ceremony audience. Airlines do not pay any entry or registration fee to be eligible for the awards and all costs of the survey and awards event are paid for by Skytrax.

            "text": "Even Goldman Sachs is succumbing to the gloomy mood on Wall Street by abandoning its previously optimistic stance and warning that US stocks will end the year deeply in the red. Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) took an ax late Thursday to its stock market forecast, slashing its year-end target for the S&P 500 from 4,300 to just 3,600. That implies a further drop of 2% from current levels and no lasting rebound. Worse, the Wall Street bank warns of even more trouble for stocks in a potential recession and concedes risks to its outlook are tilted to the downside. \u201cThe outlook is unusually murky,\u201d Goldman Sachs strategists wrote in the report. \u201cThe forward paths of inflation, economic growth, interest rates, earnings and valuations are all in flux more than usual with a wider distribution of potential outcomes.\u201d In other words, no one really knows what happens next. That uncertainty is contributing to the ongoing selloff in the stock market. The Dow tumbled below the 30,000 level on Friday, losing more than 660 points, or 2.2%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq dropped 2.4% apiece. Stubbornly high inflation has forced the Federal Reserve to keep its foot firmly pressed on the brakes \u2014 at a time when some investors were hoping it would begin to let up. The Fed is intentionally slowing the economy to get inflation under control. Drastic interest rate hikes, and the potential for more to come, raise the risk the Fed overdoes it and causes a recession. \u201cBased on our client discussions, a majority of equity investors have adopted the view that a hard landing scenario is inevitable,\u201d Goldman Sachs strategists wrote, \u201cand their focus is on the timing, magnitude, and duration of a potential recession and investment strategies for that outlook.\u201d Of course, no one knows for sure if there will be a recession. It\u2019s possible investors are overly pessimistic and the economy will avoid a downturn. But if there is a recession, Goldman Sachs expects the S&P 500 to keep sliding, eventually bottoming at 3,150. That translates to a further decline of 14% from current levels. Bank of America is warning clients that the market environment feels increasingly like the scary days of March 2020, except this time neither the Federal Reserve nor politicians in Washington are coming to the rescue. One concern is that the full impact of interest rate increases take months to be felt. That means the Fed may not know it has overdone it, until it\u2019s too late. \u201cThe Fed is hiking at the fastest pace in recent memory with maximum uncertainty on the macro outlook,\u201d Bank of America strategists wrote in a report to clients on Friday. \u201cTo us, this seems like driving at 75 mph but not knowing which way the road will turn. An accident seems inevitable.\u201d",

            "text": "Boeing and its former CEO Dennis Muilenburg agreed to pay hefty fines to settle charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission that they misled the public about the safety of the 737 Max following two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. The SEC alleges that, following an October 2018 crash of a Lion Air 737 Max jet that killed 189 people, Boeing and Muilenburg knew that part of the plane\u2019s flight control system posed an ongoing safety concern yet told the public that the 737 Max was safe to fly. After a March 10, 2019 fatal 737 Max crash, the SEC alleges that Boeing and Muilenburg knowingly misled the public about \u201cslips\u201d and \u201cgaps\u201d in the certification process of that flight control system. \u201cIn times of crisis and tragedy, it is especially important that public companies and executives provide full, fair, and truthful disclosures to the markets,\u201d said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a statement. \u201cThe Boeing Company and its former CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, failed in this most basic obligation. They misled investors by providing assurances about the safety of the 737 MAX, despite knowing about serious safety concerns.\u201d In a statement, Boeing said that the settlement \u201cfully resolves the SEC\u2019s previously disclosed inquiry into matters relating to the 737 MAX accidents.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s settlement is part of the company\u2019s broader effort to responsibly resolve outstanding legal matters related to the 737 MAX accidents in a manner that serves the best interests of our shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders,\u201d Boeing said. The company and Muilenburg agreed to settle charges of violating the antifraud provisions of US securities laws, but they did not admit or deny the SEC\u2019s allegations. Boeing agreed to pay a $200 million settlement and Muilenburg agreed to pay $1 million. \u201cBoeing and Muilenburg put profits over people by misleading investors about the safety of the 737 Max all in an effort to rehabilitate Boeing\u2019s image following two tragic accidents that resulted in the loss of 346 lives and incalculable grief to so many families,\u201d said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division in a statement. Muilenburg lost the top job at Boeing in December 2019. But he left with stock options and other assets worth about $80 million at that time \u2014 though Boeing shares have lost more than half their value since then. It is unknown what Muilenburg did with his Boeing shares and options after his departure.  Steep losses While $200 million may seem like a substantial fine for a company, it is a small fraction of the losses already caused by the two fatal crashes that killed 346 people in total and led to a 20-month grounding of Boeing\u2019s best-selling plane.  Boeing already disclosed the company has taken a $21 billion hit to its bottom line because of lost sales revenue and increased costs \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t include potential legal liability to families of the victims. So the $200 million fine represents less than 1% of its previously disclosed losses. Investors have lost even more: Boeing\u2019s market capitalization has plunged about 58%, or $115 billion, since the first crash of a 737 Max soon after take-off from Indonesia in October 2018. While about $100 billion of that has occurred in the pandemic era that has hurt demand for flying and aircraft purchases, the prolonged grounding of the Max opened the door for airlines to cancel hundreds of orders for the planes without penalty.  Shares of Boeing\n            \n                (BA) fell more than 3% Thursday but rose slightly in after-hours trading following the SEC\u2019s announcement.",

            "title": "Saudi Arabia buys pair of SpaceX astronaut seats from Axiom",
            "text": "Saudi Arabia is planning to launch two astronauts to the International Space Station aboard a space capsule from Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, becoming the latest Gulf nation to strengthen ties with private U.S. space companies, according to three people familiar with the arrangement. The sources, speaking anonymously to discuss the mission\u2019s crew before its formal announcement, said the deal was signed privately earlier this year with Houston\u2019s Axiom Space, which arranges and manages private missions to space on U.S. spacecraft for researchers and tourists. Under the deal, two Saudi astronauts will ride SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon capsule to the space station for a roughly weeklong stay early next year, the sources said. The Saudis would be the first from their country to go into space aboard a private spacecraft. Axiom had no immediate comment. Officials with the Saudi Space Commission, Riyadh\u2019s space agency founded in 2018, were not immediately available to comment. Private U.S. companies have increasingly played a key role in sending astronauts to the space station as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the U.S. space agency now focusing heavily on returning humans to the moon, looks to commercialize the United States\u2019 decades-old human spaceflight presence in low-Earth orbit. The deal would mark the latest that puts companies like Axiom in a unique role of diplomacy long dominated by government agencies like NASA. The space station is a football field-sized laboratory some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth that has housed international crews of astronauts for over 20 years. The Saudi astronauts will join two previously announced Americans, retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson and race car driver and investor John Shoffner, the sources said. The mission, called Ax-2, will be the second spaceflight arranged by Axiom. The private astronauts aboard Ax-2 have yet to be approved by a NASA-chaired panel of the space station\u2019s participating stakeholders and countries, such as Russia, Canada, Japan and the European Space Agency, a U.S. official said. The official added that the mission is likely to receive approval. For Axiom and other space companies, cutting deals with foreign governments is seen as vital to sustaining a business centered on putting people in space. Putting people into space is a luxury for wealthy adventure seekers and a source of national prestige and inspiration for aspiring space powers like Saudi Arabia. Axiom launched its first private mission to the space station in April, sending a four-man crew to the space station aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that included a Canadian investor and an Israeli businessman. And Axiom on Monday announced a deal with Turkey to launch the country\u2019s first two astronauts into space in late 2023. That will likely be for mission Ax-3, according to a person familiar with the flight. Axiom\u2019s astronaut flight business is crucial experience for the company\u2019s broader goals of deploying its own private space station by mid-decade. It plans to first attach modules to the ISS before splitting off into a fully private structure once the existing international laboratory is retired around 2030. The value of Axiom\u2019s Saudi agreement was not clear. Each Crew Dragon seat on Axiom\u2019s first mission sold for $55 million each.",

            "text": "Corporate America is starting to brace for a recession. Economic bellwether FedEx\n            \n                (FDX) stunned Wall Street last week with a massive earnings warning and tepid outlook for the global economy. FedEx\u2019s bad news overshadowed a more promising development on Thursday, the agreement between railroad operators and unions to avoid what could have been a crippling freight rail strike.  Still, investors remain nervous about the health of the railroad business, a sign of the jitters about the overall economy. Shares of top rail operators Union Pacific\n            \n                (UNP), CSX\n            \n                (CSX) and Norfolk Southern\n            \n                (NSC) are down sharply this year. Even Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKB), which owns Burlington Northern Santa Fe, has taken a dip lately.  But FedEx isn\u2019t the only company sounding the recession alarm bell. In an unusually dour earnings call earlier this month, the CEO of high-end furnishings retailer RH\n            \n                (RH) (aka Restoration Hardware) said that \u201canybody who thinks we\u2019re not in a recession is crazy\u201d and added that the housing market is in a downturn that is \u201cjust getting started.\u201d The chief financial officer of Best Buy\n            \n                (BBY) said at the end of August that he expects sales growth will continue to slow. And while the company avoided using the term recession, Best Buy\n            \n                (BBY)\u2019s CFO did say there is \u201ca belief that the current macro environment trends could be even more challenging \u2026 for the remainder of the year.\u201d  The CEO of PVH\n            \n                (PVH), which owns the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands, noted in the company\u2019s late August earnings call that, \u201chigh gas prices and other inflationary pressures began to affect consumer discretionary spending,\u201d during the summer, adding that the shift \u201cwas most pronounced for us in the middle-income and value consumer in North America.\u201d Chip equipment leader Applied Materials\n            \n                (AMAT) noted in an earnings call last month that some of its semiconductor customers are in slowdown mode \u201cas macro uncertainty and weakness in consumer electronics and PCs causes these companies to defer some orders.\u201d   Report cards from big companies to give clues about economy These are ominous signs. And even more companies are likely to reference the slowing economy \u2014 some execs may even dare to use the R-word \u2014 in the coming weeks. Most of Corporate America operates on a calendar year schedule for earnings, which means they will report third quarter results in October.  Tech titans Apple\n            \n                (AAPL) and Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT), streaming leader Netflix\n            \n                (NFLX), consumer products stalwarts Coca-Cola\n            \n                (KO) and Procter & Gamble\n            \n                (PG), restaurant chains McDonald\u2019s\n            \n                (MCD) and Chipotle\n            \n                (CMG) and banking leaders JPMorgan Chase\n            \n                (JPM) and Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) are just a few of the blue chips that will give financial updates next month. The change in sentiment has been dramatic. According to estimates tracked by FactSet, as recently as June 30 earnings for the third quarter were expected to rise by nearly 10% from a year ago.  But as companies and analysts have cut their outlooks, forecasts now call for just a 3.5% profit increase. That would be the worst quarter for earnings since a 5.7% decrease in the third quarter of 2020, when the economy was reeling from Covid-imposed lockdowns.  FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters noted that the magnitude of the change in earnings estimates is the biggest since the second quarter of 2020, which is when many companies first went into shutdown mode. Aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, which are expected to continue with the Fed likely raising rates sharply again later this week, are also stoking the recession fears.  What\u2019s more, other global central banks, including the European Central Bank and Bank of England, are now in tightening mode too. That adds to the risk that a global spike in rates will lead to a further slowdown in earnings, consumer spending and the overall economy. \u201cSentiment and market momentum have turned decidedly negative,\u201d said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide, in a report last week. \u201cEarnings fears have now joined inflation and the Fed at the front of mind of investors.\u201d  Hackett added that \u201cgrowth expectations continue to moderate\u201d and that CEOs and small businesses are increasingly worrying about a recession.  It\u2019s worth noting that not all recessions are \u201cGreat Recessions\u201d like 2008. The US economy had far more modest downturns in 1990 after oil prices spiked during the first Gulf War as well as in 2001 following the implosion of the dot-com bubble. And the Covid recession of 2020 lasted just two months, the briefest downturn on record.  There is one possible bright spot. The US housing market, despite concerns about surging prices and soaring mortgage rates, is expected to slow but not crash like it did during the subprime crisis of 2007 and 2008. Executives at companies such as construction equipment giant Deere\n            \n                (DE), home improvement retailers Home Depot\n            \n                (HD) and Lowe\u2019s\n            \n                (LOW) and appliance maker Whirlpool\n            \n                (WHR), have acknowledged in conference calls that while a short-term softening of demand for housing is likely, another massive bubble burst doesn\u2019t appear to be in the cards.

Elon Musk, still the No. 1 wealthiest person with $260 billion to his name, may need to watch his back. Adani has taken less than 10 months to reach the No. 2 spot after starting the year in 14th. It\u2019s the first time a person from Asia has ranked so highly on Bloomberg\u2019s list, which has long been dominated by white tech entrepreneurs.  Adani\u2019s $146.9 billion fortune, largely tied up in holdings of his sprawling Adani Group conglomerate, still trails well behind Musk\u2019s $260 billion.

            "text": "US stocks fell on Friday after FedEx served investors a brutal pre-earnings announcement about the state of the global economy.  The Dow closed down 140 points, or 0.5%, lower. The S&P 500 fell 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.9%.  All three major indexes logged their fourth losing week out of the last five. The Dow dropped 4.1% for the week, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq dropped 5% and 5.5%, respectively. Shares of FedEx\n            \n                (FDX) were down nearly 22% after the company withdrew its full-year guidance late Thursday and warned that a slowing economy will cause it to fall $500 million short of its revenue target. The weakening global economy, particularly in Asia and Europe has hurt FedEx\n            \n                (FDX) (FDX)\u2019s express delivery business. The company said demand for packages weakened considerably in the final weeks of the quarter. During an interview Thursday on CNBC, FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam was asked if he believes the slowdown in his business is a sign of the start of a global recession. \u201cI think so,\u201d he responded. \u201cThese numbers, they don\u2019t portend very well.\u201d This marks FedEx\u2019s worst one-day drop in history \u2014 topping the 16% plunge the day of the 1987 stock market crash. The Dow Transportation Index also fell by more than 5% in Friday trading and FedEx competitor, UPS\n            \n                (UPS), was also down about 5%.  Transport stocks are thought of as a leading indicator for the market at large, and FedEx in particular is seen as a market bellwether. The announcement could contribute to broader declines in a market that\u2019s already heading for a big losing week.  Still, some analysts think that Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN) could be responsible for FedEx\u2019s headache. \u201cAmazon\n            \n                (AMZN) [recently] launched free shipping software for sellers, and discounted shipping rates,\u201d wrote JPMorgan\u2019s Jack Atherton in a client note.  \u201cAmazon has piled money into its logistics capability over the past few years, to the point it has excess capacity for its own needs and is hungry for more share which is being targeted through FBA (Fulfillment By Amazon) and could be weighing on FedEx.\u201d   Amazon stock was down more than 2% on Friday.  Either way, the third-quarter reporting season begins next month and FedEx\u2019s warning adds to the souring outlook of analysts on earnings expectations.  Third quarter earnings-per-share estimates have slipped more than 5.5% since the end of June, according to FactSet data. That\u2019s the largest drop for a quarter since the second quarter of 2020 (when Covid-19 sent the United States into recession). The FedEx announcement also comes as investors worry about a weakening economic outlook as the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates aggressively to bring inflation under control. The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index preliminary September reading added to investors\u2019 woes on Friday, it came in at 59.5, its highest level since April but below economists\u2019 estimates. The September survey showed that respondents don\u2019t expect high prices to go away any time soon, consumers said they\u2019re expecting inflation to hit 4.6% over the next 12 months and 2.8% within the next five years.  That\u2019s bad news for investors as expectations can be a self-fulfilling prophecy: If consumers anticipate that prices will remain high, they\u2019ll likely spend more and demand higher wages while businesses might raise prices to accommodate higher demand and wages. If expectations are lower, they might rein in spending and ask for smaller wages increases.  Friday\u2019s consumer sentiment report is the last major piece of economic data before the Federal Reserve meets next week to discuss monetary policy and determine whether it will raise rates once again in its battle to tame inflation. Still, the largest part of this week\u2019s market loss came on Tuesday after a key inflation reading, August\u2019s consumer price index report, came in hot. The Dow lost 1,200 points on the news\u2013 it\u2019s worst decline since June 2020. ",

            "text": "United Airlines considers government air traffic controller staffing shortages its top concern and says there is still time to minimize the impact on holiday travel this winter.    \u201cWhen you have air traffic control close a center down or close a region of the country, it leads to hundreds of delays and cancellations and there\u2019s just nothing else \u2013 there\u2019s no other rocks that are anywhere close to the size of that,\u201d CEO Scott Kirby told CNN\u2019s Pete Muntean at the Global Aerospace Summit organized by the US Chamber of Commerce.    The Federal Aviation Administration, which runs air traffic control, and airlines like United spent the summer at loggerheads over who was to blame for major travel disruptions. More than 57,000 flights have been canceled and 638,000 delayed since the start of the Memorial Day weekend, according to FlightAware data.    Now, Kirby says he is speaking \u201cdiplomatically\u201d and attempting to rally the aviation industry and ultimately lawmakers to fund more controllers and better technology for the FAA.    \u201cIt was tight before the pandemic and they don\u2019t have enough people today and they need more,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cAnd we in aviation have to commit to helping them get that.\u201d  The FAA said in response to Kirby\u2019s comments that its focus \u201cis keeping airline passengers safe.\u201d    \u201cAirlines should focus on restoring customers\u2019 faith by being transparent about the cause of interruptions and by delivering what they promise,\u201d spokesman Matt Lehner said in a statement.    The FAA pointed to data from its tracking systems showing delays attributed to airline issues increased in recent years while those attributed to FAA issues are down. Weather-driven disruptions are a separate category.    Kirby said several airlines, including his, have pulled off multiple days in recent weeks without any cancellations.   The FAA is currently led by an interim chief while the Biden administration\u2019s pick to lead the agency is under review and scrutiny.    Kirby has another gripe with the FAA \u2013 how it manages heavy interest in flying in and around Newark \u2013 but said Thursday the agency on the whole \u201cdoes a heroic effort\u201d managing air traffic.    \u201cAir traffic control is set up in a way that they\u2019re staffed on average well throughout the year,\u201d he said.   \u201cSo in September when demand is lower things go great because you don\u2019t have staffing shortages.\u201d  But volume at peak periods plus weather can cause disruptions to \u201cquickly spiral out in an exponential way.\u201d    \u201cI think if we work together on this, we can certainly make the holidays better,\u201d Kirby said.

            "title": "These companies are looking at using rockets to blast cargo across the planet",
            "text": "The US military is racking up deals with commercial rocket companies to explore the idea of using rockets typically tasked with launching satellites or astronauts to shuttle military cargo around the world at record speeds. The companies so far tapped to join the military in exploring ways to bring that idea to fruition include Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin, and, most recently, Rocket Lab, according to a Tuesday press release.  Two other startups, Colorado-based Sierra Space Corporation and the Richard Branson-backed company Virgin Orbit, have also signed deals. Essentially, the lineup is a who\u2019s-who of the commercial \u201cnew space\u201d sector \u2014 relatively young rocket companies that are already shaking up the business of getting satellites to orbit at cheaper price points. But these deals with the military are something different. Rather than rockets leaving their freight in Earth\u2019s orbit, this program aims to use them to get weapons, supplies or perhaps even people from one country to another at speeds far surpassing that of other types of transportation. And that\u2019s because rockets have a speed advantage over airplanes. Rockets that can shoot into the high atmosphere have much less air to cut through as they zoom over the planet. With less air dragging them back, they can go much faster than something that needs air to move, like a jet. The tradeoff, however, is that rockets tend to be far more expensive than aircraft. \u201cImagine traveling from the continental United States to anywhere in the Pacific region and measuring your transit time in minutes,\u201d reads an August press release from the military\u2019s US Transportation Command. \u201cPicture the U.S. delivering assistance to an ally needing disaster relief, or combating an adversary planning provocative actions against U.S. national interests at rocket-speed.\u201d It\u2019s a similar idea to one employed by the largest militaries in the world for decades, that of the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. But while those are designed to slam into the Earth at hypersonic speeds when they reach their target, the idea here is for the payload to come to a gentle landing.  The contracts fall under a program headed by the Air Force Research Laboratory, simply called \u201cRocket Cargo.\u201d And it\u2019s one of the Air Force Department\u2019s four \u201cVanguard Programs,\u201d which are high-profile projects pegged for accelerated development. The military\u2019s current investment in the program is \u201csmall,\u201d according to a May statement from Air Force deputy assistant secretary Kristen Baldwin, though the goal is for the military to influence \u201cearly commercial design efforts and leverages $5-10B ongoing industry and NASA investments.\u201d The idea of using rockets for point-to-point travel on Earth isn\u2019t new. SpaceX, for example, has advertised that its forthcoming Starship rocket could be used to shuttle paying customers from New York to Shanghai in 40 minutes.  That option remains a long way off for consumers. And broadly speaking, rockets making point-to-point trips are still a distant goal. The trips would be extremely expensive as well as technologically and geopolitically complicated. (There aren\u2019t, after all, a ton of pressing reasons to get people or cargo from one place to another at breakneck speeds.) But with current trends in the burgeoning commercial space industry, some believe it\u2019s inevitable. The market for hypersonic passenger travel could be a $20 billion per-year industry, UBS estimated in 2019.  And the military\u2019s goal with the Rocket Cargo program, which was first announced last year, is to get involved with such efforts early in the hopes that it can quickly put that tech to work for the US and allies when it is available. \u201cLogistics speed is at the heart of military supremacy. If a commercial company is in advanced development for a new capability to move materiel faster, then [the Department of Defense] needs to promptly engage and seek to be early adopters,\u201d according to the program\u2019s website.  For its part, Rocket Lab plans to use its new deal with the military to explore ways of using its Electron rocket \u2014 which the company hopes will also be reusable if it can figure out how to capture it with a helicopter mid-air after launch \u2014 to shuttle cargo around the Earth as well as a larger, forthcoming rocketing called Neutron. Additionally, the company hopes to explore how it might use its Photon spacecraft to establish \u201ccargo depots\u201d in Earth\u2019s orbit that will have the ability to re-enter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and get needed supplies to a targeted area, according to a press release.",

Volkswagen\n            \n                (VLKAF) first started looking at spinning off the high-performance automaker in February, just as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine jolted investors. In a statement late on Monday, Volkswagen said it had decided to press ahead with the initial public offering later this month or in early October, \u201csubject to further capital market developments.\u201d Up to 12.5% of Porsche will be offered to investors in the form of preference shares, with nearly half of the proceeds \u201cof a successful IPO\u201d to be distributed to Volkswagen shareholders in the form of a special dividend, the company added. Volkswagen has also said it plans to use the proceeds from the IPO to bolster its efforts to build more electric vehicles. The company intends to dole out \u20ac89 billion ($88.4 billion) over the next five years on developing EVs, about half of its planned spending in that time. It wants EVs to represent a quarter of sales by the end of 2026.  Reuters has reported the initial public offering could value Porsche as high as \u20ac85 billion ($84.4 billion), and that Volkswagen could raise more than \u20ac10.5 billion ($10.4 billion). That would set it up to be one of Europe\u2019s biggest IPOs ever, according to data from Dealogic. The blockbuster listing will go ahead even as recession fears, soaring energy prices in Europe and uncertainty about plans by central banks to slow inflation roil markets. That\u2019s slowed most dealmaking to a crawl, as companies wait for more certainty before pursuing mergers or public offerings. A leadership shakeup at Volkswagen has added to uncertainty over the listing. Oliver Blume took the reins as chief executive of the German auto giant this month after Herbert Diess was ousted from the job in July. ",

The Austrian-registered Cessna Citation 551 departed Jerez, Spain at 12:56 UTC (8:56am ET) and its intended destination was Cologne, Germany, according to Flightradar24, a website which monitors global air traffic. But it came down in waters near the city of Ventspils in Latvia, according to Latvia\u2019s defense minister and deputy prime minister Artis Pabriks, who said the Latvian military was deployed in a search and rescue operation. The aircraft was certified for single-pilot operations, according to German newspaper Bild, which reported that the plane had four people on board, including the pilot, a man, a woman, and a person Bild described as a daughter, without providing further details.  \u201cJets from NATO allies and partners were scrambled to follow the private Cessna plane which crashed on Sunday evening off the Latvian coast.

            "text": "Flights used to be a chance to sit back (albeit a bit cramped) and watch a recently released movie or catch up on some reading. Now they\u2019re just another place to log on. Delta and United each host more than 1.5 million inflight WiFi sessions a month, the airlines told CNN Business, while JetBlue said its service is used by \u201cmillions of customers\u201d every year. Southwest declined to share specific numbers but said inflight Wifi is \u201cpopular.\u201d Alaska Airlines, meanwhile, estimates that about 35% of its passengers on average make use of its $8 onboard WiFi services which include surfing the web and streaming.  While most airlines will allow certain messaging apps for free, full internet access in the skies usually comes at a premium, with Delta charging nearly $50 for a monthly pass on US flights (though the airline plans to switch to a $5 per flight per device offering by the end of this year). But with a market that\u2019s currently estimated at around $5 billion and projected to grow to more than $12 billion by 2030, according to research firm Verified Market Research, there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement.  Inflight internet has been around for nearly two decades, with aircraft manufacturer Boeing announcing its service, known as Connexion, in April 2000 and debuting it on a Munich-Los Angeles Lufthansa flight in 2004. Boeing discontinued the service in 2006, saying the market for it had \u201cnot materialized\u201d as expected. But the advent of smartphones and subsequent efforts by a host of satellite providers and airlines have helped the technology evolve significantly in the past decade \u2014 though it still has some catching up to do in order to compare to home and office networks. How it works There are two main types of inflight connections. The first, known as air-to-ground or ATG, relies on antennae attached to the aircraft that catch the signal from cellphone towers on the ground.  Intelsat, which launched air-to-ground services with American Airlines in 2008, currently operates a version of the technology on more than 1,000 aircraft across North America. The one major drawback of this technology is that, much like cellphone service on the ground, it is dependent on the density and connectivity of towers, and so flights over rural areas, deserts or large water bodies are likely to suffer drops in connectivity. The maximum speeds for these systems are currently around 5 megabits per second (which is shared by hundreds of passengers), according to Andrew Zignani, a research director at technology intelligence firm ABI Research who specializes in wireless connectivity. By comparison, median global download speeds for mobile and fixed broadband are around 30 megabits per second and 67 megabits per second respectively, according to recent data from monitoring app Speedtest. \u201cTo date, the biggest issues have been speed, limited availability, gaps in coverage, dropouts, and price,\u201d Zignani told CNN Business. That\u2019s why airlines and providers are increasingly switching to satellite-based connections that are relatively less susceptible to interruptions because they can more effectively cover the entirety of the flight path from space and keep the signal active as it moves through the air. That includes Intelsat, which has a network of over 50 satellites serving airlines such as Alaska, American, Delta, United, Air Canada, British Airways and Cathay Pacific.  \u201cAs regional jet fleets are refreshed we expect the majority to migrate to satellite-based solutions,\u201d Jeff Sare, Intelsat\u2019s president of commercial aviation, told CNN Business.  Viasat, another major provider used by several airlines around the world, uses its own network of satellites that provide high-speed connectivity and is gearing up to launch another satellite constellation later this year. The company debuted its services with JetBlue in 2013 and now serves more than a dozen airlines around the world.  But even satellite connections are currently capable of around 100 megabits per second per aircraft or around 15 megabits per second per passenger device, a far cry from the speeds terrestrial WiFi is capable of. Many airlines use a combination of WiFi providers and types of technologies, depending on the type of aircraft and routes they need to be deployed on.  Newer players such as Starlink, the satellite internet service run by billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s company SpaceX, are also entering the fray. Earlier this year, SpaceX announced a partnership with Hawaiian Airlines to provide high-speed internet through Starlink\u2019s network of low-earth orbit satellites. \u201cSome of these solutions also adopt a hybrid approach, combining the best of both technologies to ensure optimal coverage depending on the specific flight path,\u201d said Zignani. \u201cI believe we will see opportunities for all technologies in the coming years, and recent partnerships are showing that each technology will have its own part to play,\u201d he added. Challenges and opportunities There are still gaps between inflight WiFi and the networks you would use in your home, office, a coffee shop, or anywhere on the ground.  While most airline WiFi connections now support messaging and social media functions, and some even have live TV and video streaming capabilities, providing users with the same level of bandwidth and connectivity mid-air can be a challenge.  \u201cThe biggest point of difference for inflight WiFi is the complexity added by the mobility element,\u201d Don Buchman, vice president and general manager for commercial aviation at Viasat, told CNN Business. \u201cThe aircraft is traveling at a high rate of speed, typically banking during the flight, and often flying across large geographical areas that demand consistent coverage for a high-quality in-flight connectivity experience.\u201d And while satellites solve for some of the restrictions that cellphone towers face, expanding the satellite network to keep up with increasing demand is not always straightforward. As Sare of Intelsat puts it: \u201cIt is much faster and cheaper to deploy new cellular towers than to launch a satellite on a rocket.\u201d In a survey by Intelsat last year of airlines, service providers and equipment manufacturers, 65% of respondents said they anticipate increases in the number of passengers who expect to be connected while flying. The two biggest impediments to increasing inflight WiFi adoption, the survey indicated, were the high price of the service and \u201cpoor internet connection.\u201d Companies such as Viasat, Intelsat and Starlink continue to expand that capacity, however, launching more satellites every year in anticipation of the growing demand for their services. That added capacity will not only enhance the online experience for users, but could also potentially give airlines more avenues to monetize and lower the price. \u201cOne example is ad sponsored inflight WiFi so passengers can access WiFi for free and use it however they would like,\u201d Buchman said, adding that Viasat is also exploring ways to use its connectivity services to help airlines with functions such as crew management and aircraft maintenance.  The biggest priority, according to Sare of Intelsat, is shortening the time it takes to make those technological advances happen, and he foresees more partnerships between companies to help move the industry standard forward. \u201cOur vision is achieved when passengers can\u2019t tell the difference between being connected on the ground and in the air.\u201d",

            "text": "India joined an elite league of the world\u2019s naval powers on Friday, when it commissioned its first domestically built aircraft carrier, the INS Vikrant. With the $3 billion Vikrant, India will join only a small number of nations with more than one aircraft carrier or helicopter carrier in service and become only the third country, after the UK and China, to have commissioned a domestically built aircraft carrier in the past three years. The carrier has filled the nation with \u201cnew confidence,\u201d Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at a ceremony marked by fanfare at the Cochin Shipyard in India\u2019s southern Kerala state.  \u201cThe goal may be difficult. The challenges may be big. But when India makes up its mind, no goal is impossible,\u201d Modi said, before boarding the carrier and unfurling the country\u2019s new naval flag.  \u201cTill now, this type of aircraft carrier was made only by developed countries. Today, India by entering this league has taken one more step towards becoming a developed nation,\u201d Modi said, adding the Indo-Pacific region remained \u201ca major security priority\u201d for India.  John Bradford, senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said India\u2019s commitment to the ship reflected its \u201clong-term vision to maintaining a world-class naval force.\u201d \u201cThere are looming questions about the survivability of any carrier in the missile age, but major navies \u2013 including those of the US, Japan, China and the UK \u2013 are doubling down on their carrier investments. In this sense India is keeping in the race,\u201d Bradford said.  Vikrant joins the carrier INS Vikramaditya, a refurbished Soviet-era carrier bought from Russia in 2004, in India\u2019s fleet. With a displacement of around 40,000 tons, the Vikrant is slightly smaller than the Vikramaditya and the carriers of the US, China and UK though it is larger than Japan\u2019s. But analysts praised its potential firepower. When its air wing becomes fully operational over the next few years, Vikrant will carry up to 30 aircraft, including MiG-29K fighter jets \u2013 to be launched from its ski-ramp style deck \u2013 and helicopters as well as defensive systems including surface-to-air missiles. Powered by four gas turbine engines, its top speed is estimated at 32 mph (52 kph) with a range of 8,600 miles (13,890 kilometers). \u201cIndia is sending out the message that it has the power, it has the aircraft carriers and therefore the air power to dominate the distant reaches of the Indian Ocean,\u201d said Ajai Shukla, a former Indian military officer turned defense analyst. Analysts said the new carrier, and the destroyers and frigates that will eventually make up its strike group, gives India options further afield, too.  \u201cIndia can both influence and coordinate potential security solutions to regional concerns. Having an open ocean capability naval task group to contribute adds to India\u2019s clout and options. It needn\u2019t join in a multilateral response but can do so, or establish a separate independent presence, if it chooses,\u201d said Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain who now teaches at Hawaii Pacific University. The new carrier will enable India to take a bigger role in military exercises by the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or \u201cQuad,\u201d an informal alliance of the United States, Japan, Australia and India. For instance, the US and Japanese carriers have taken part in the annual Malabar exercises attended by Quad members.   Building Vikrant hasn\u2019t been easy for India. The government signed off on its design and construction in 2003 and the keel was laid in February 2009. The ship was christened Vikrant \u2013 which means \u201ccourageous\u201d or \u201cvictorious\u201d in Sanskrit \u2013 and launched in August 2013. But then delays set in: features needed to be redesigned, there was trouble securing aviation equipment from Russia, and then there was the Covid-19 pandemic. Still, experts say India will be able to enhance its domestic shipbuilding capacity and learn from the experience. \u201cThey now have the expertise to build the next carrier more quickly and probably with a better design,\u201d Schuster said. The Indian Navy is considering building a second indigenous carrier. This remains in the concept phase but there has been speculation that any new carrier could be in the 65,000-ton range, about the size of the UK\u2019s HMS Queen Elizabeth or China\u2019s second carrier, the Shandong. China is seen as India\u2019s main naval competitor in the region. With two carriers in service and a third far more advanced carrier launched in the past year, China is ahead of India both numerically and technologically, but analysts give India the edge in operational carrier experience. The Indian Navy began operating aircraft carriers in 1961. Its first carrier, which it acquired from the UK, was also called Vikrant. The first Vikrant was retired in 1997. A second British-built carrier, INS Viraat, served in the Indian Navy for 30 years before its decommissioning in 2017.  China\u2019s first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, was an unfinished Soviet-era vessel that Beijing bought from Ukraine in 1998, updated and finally commissioned in 2012. Its first domestically built carrier, the Shandong, entered service in 2019 and in June 2022 it launched its third carrier, Fujian \u2013 an advanced carrier with electromagnetic catapult-assisted launch systems, similar to those used by the US. \u201cOn paper, China\u2019s new carriers have more capabilities in terms of payload and technology than Vikrant. However, India has decades of experience operating carrier aviation forces while China is still learning,\u201d said Bradford, the Singapore analyst. Even with that experience it could take a year or much longer for Vikrant to get fully up to speed as a fighting force. That\u2019s typical for aircraft carriers. America\u2019s newest carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, was commissioned in 2017 and is only expected to have its first deployment later this year.",

The close pass occurred when the planes were departing the Orlando International Airport on August 17, the FAA said in a statement. No injuries were reported in the incident. \u201cThe Cessna departed from Runway 36-Left a short time before the Delta flight was cleared to depart from Runway 35-Left,\u201d the statement said.   Delta flight 1373 was headed to Atlanta, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. The FAA said the planes were about three-tenths of a mile horizontally and 500 feet vertically from each other, according to preliminary information. At 500 feet, the aircraft were about one and a half football fields apart.  \u201cThe pilots of both aircraft reported having the other in sight,\u201d the agency said. Delta Airlines said it was aware of the \u201creports involving aircraft\u201d near the airport and that it was investigating the incident. \u201cNothing is more important than safety,\u201d the airline said. It\u2019s unclear whether the horizontal and vertical distance cited by the FAA is a violation of any FAA air traffic control protocols. In an interview with ABC News, the Cessna pilot Malik Clarke said he saw the Delta aircraft on the runway. \u201cWe thought it had landed because we thought there\u2019s no way air traffic controllers would, you know, put us in a situation like that,\u201d he told the network. When Clarke saw the Delta flight taking off, he told ABC News it didn\u2019t look right. \u201cSo immediately I turned right, and I climbed as deeply as I could because the Boeing 757 from Delta has a much higher climb rate than the aircraft that I was flying,\u201d he said in the interview. CNN has reached out to Clarke but he has yet to respond. CNN has also reached out to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association for comment on the incident.",

            "text": "Starbucks has tapped Laxman Narasimhan as its next CEO.  Narasimhan will become incoming CEO at Starbucks on October 1. He will officially begin his role in April and will then join the company\u2019s board of directors, as well.  The Reckitt Benckiser Group, where Narasimhan most recently served as CEO, announced   earlier on Thursday that he would be stepping down. Howard Schultz, who took over Starbucks from outgoing CEO Kevin Johnson in an interim capacity last spring, will stay on as interim CEO throughout the transition. He will remain on Starbucks\u2019 board.  Narasimhan steps into the role at a pivotal moment for Starbucks. In the United States, the company is trying to fend off a unionization wave in the United States. Meanwhile, strict Covid-19 restrictions have been hurting the company\u2019s business in China, a crucial market.   In the six months before Narasimhan officially takes over, he will spend time with Schultz, other company leaders, employees and customers and become acquainted with the reinvention plan recently laid out by Schultz, who has said the company needs an overhaul.  \u201cThe Starbucks business as it is built today is not set up to fully satisfy the evolving behaviors, needs and expectations of our partners or customers,\u201d Schultz wrote in an open letter in July. \u201cIt is not designed for the future we aspire to for ourselves and the communities in which we serve.\u201d  Schultz\u2019s plan for change includes \u201cradically improving\u201d the experience of employees and redesigning stores, he wrote at the time. The company has since made changes like closing some stores, citing safety concerns.  Narasimhan said in a statement Thursday that he is \u201chumbled\u201d to join Starbucks \u201cas the reinvention and investments in the partner and customer experiences position us to meet the changing demands we face today.\u201d  On Thursday, Schultz said Narasimhan is the right person for the job. \u201cHe is a strategic and transformational leader with deep experience in building powerful consumer brands,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cHe is the leader we were looking for.\u201d  Narasimhan\u2019s previous company, Reckitt Benckiser, is the UK-based maker of several hygiene and health brands, including Durex condoms, Lysol and Mucinex. He was named CEO of the multi-billion dollar company in 2019.  The British company said in a statement earlier Thursday that \u201cLaxman has decided for personal and family reasons to relocate back to the United States and has been approached for an opportunity that enables him to live there.\u201d  Before joining Reckitt Benckiser, Narasimhan held several positions at PepsiCo\n            \n                (PEP), including global chief commercial officer. He was also a senior partner at McKinsey, focusing on consumer and retail.  Mellody Hobson, independent chair of the Starbucks board, called Narasimhan \u201can inspiring leader,\u201d adding that \u201chis deep, hands-on experience driving strategic transformations at global consumer-facing businesses makes him the ideal choice.\u201d  News of the Narasimhan\u2019s appointment comes ahead of Starbucks\u2019 annual investor day on September 13.

Nvidia\n            \n                (NVDA) and AMD\n            \n                (AMD) said Wednesday that they had been told by the US government to halt exports of certain high-performance chips to the world\u2019s second largest economy.  In a regulatory filing, Nvidia said that it had been told by US officials that the requirement was due to a potential risk of the products being used by, or diverted to, a \u201cmilitary end user.\u201d  The restrictions cover Nvidia\u2019s A100 and forthcoming H100 integrated circuits, and any systems that include them, effective immediately, it said.   The move threatens to upend $400 million worth of business for Nvidia, according to the filing.  That\u2019s roughly what the California-based tech giant projected last week in potential sales to China, which could be affected by the new requirement, it said in the filing. Nvidia shares tumbled 6.6% in after-hours trading Wednesday, while AMD stock was down 3.7%.  In a statement to CNN Business, Nvidia said it was working with \u201ccustomers in China to satisfy their planned or future purchases with alternative products and may seek licenses where replacements aren\u2019t sufficient.\u201d AMD, which is also headquartered in California, told CNN Business it had also been given new requirements by the US Department of Commerce that will hit shipments of its MI250 integrated circuits to China. \u201cAt this time, we do not believe that shipments of MI100 integrated circuits are impacted by the new requirements,\u201d it said, referring to another line of components. \u201cWe do not currently believe it is a material impact on our business.\u201d The new rules are a reminder of how US-China tensions remain high over business and tech.  Last week, a rare agreement between the two countries on auditing US-listed Chinese companies had suggested a breakthrough in relations, but experts have warned the deal will do little to resolve other key issues. The new mandate for chipmakers also covers a ban in exports to Russia, Nvidia and AMD noted. Both companies said they do not currently sell any products to Russia.",

            "text": "Pilots are in high demand lately \u2013 such high demand, in fact, that pilots from the recently defunct ExpressJet Airlines are finding themselves with new job offers, without so much as an interview, days after their employer declared bankruptcy. Piedmont Airlines, a regional airline based in Maryland and subsidiary of American Airlines, announced Thursday that it would offer  ExpressJet pilots conditional job offers based on seniority. The offer is based off of language in Piedmont\u2019s pilot contract, negotiated in 2021 with the largest pilot union in the world, the Airline Pilots Association, that allows for the company to offer a \u201csafe haven for employment\u201d for pilots at \u201cdistressed\u201d carriers, according to the company.  The offer isn\u2019t just coming from Piedmont Airlines, either. American Airlines subsidiary Envoy Air \u201chas the same provisions and we are offering ExpressJet/Aha pilots conditional job offers with no interview,\u201d according to Ric Wilson, Vice President of Flight Operations from Envoy Air. Atlanta-based ExpressJet operated over 450 aircraft at its peak, but pandemic-induced woes proved a fatal blow for the regional carrier. The airline, which calls itself a \u201creboot\u201d of the company formerly flying as Delta Connection and United Express, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Monday in Delaware and ceased operations, according to the company website. It pointed to stifled growth, rising costs and lower revenue due to the pandemic. \u201cNo one wants to see an airline fail, ever. We know that ExpressJet pilots are well-trained aviators who know the Embraer 145 [aircraft], and we are very pleased to make this transition as easy as possible for them,\u201d said Matt Kernan, Piedmont\u2019s Director of Operations, in a press release Thursday. \u201cThis is an opportunity to get these pilots significant pay and bonus increases, expedited job offers and in the process, help Piedmont grow its fleet.\u201d  The effort to snap up experienced pilots from the downtrodden company comes as Piedmont looks to expand its business and compete in an aviation sector with a thirst for pilots. Despite efforts by airlines to hire more pilots, the US pilot shortage is still forecast to get worse. And that will especially be true for the regional airlines like Piedmont serving smaller cities on behalf of the major carriers, like American Airlines. It is mainly those pilots who are being hired away to fly the larger jets.  Based on data from consulting firm Oliver Wyman\u2019s fleet forecast and models for industry growth, there is expected to be shortage of almost 30,000 pilots in North America by 2032 if the industry fails to address its staffing problems. That\u2019s almost four times higher than this year\u2019s anticipated gap of 8,000 pilots, which has already proven to be problematic. This shortage is hitting regional airlines like Piedmont especially hard. According to the Regional Airline Association (RAA), two dozen markets served by regional airports have lost half of their service in the last three years \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t include the rounds of cuts planned for later this year. Another 42 markets have lost between one third and half of service in that time frame.  Behind the pilot shortage is a confluence of trends, including the retirement of aging Baby Boomers and significantly fewer job candidates coming from the military, as the use of unmanned drones steadily increased and there were fewer deployments. Covid-19 exacerbated the shortfall, with airlines offering pilots early retirement at the height of the pandemic. When travel demand surged in 2021, the pilot shortfall was so dramatic that it hampered the airlines\u2019 ability to ramp back up, leading to flight delays and cancellations.  \u201cCommunities were losing air service for the better part of the last decade,\u201d said Faye Malarkey Black, CEO of the RAA. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to lose all your service to lose connectivity to the system. When you lose much of your frequency, businesses won\u2019t want to locate in a place.\u201d",

            "text": "NASA and Boeing are now targeting early 2023 for the first crewed flight of Boeing\u2019s long-delayed Starliner spacecraft, officials said during a joint press conference Thursday. Launch officials say the mission could take off as early as February, according to Steve Stich, the manager for NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program. Starliner had been slated to get astronauts off the ground by the end of 2022. But continued work on several major issues that were identified on an uncrewed test flight of Starliner in May pushed the schedule back. Starliner is already years behind schedule. It\u2019s intended to serve the same purpose as SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon capsule, which has been ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station since May 2020. The issues that officials identified during Starliner\u2019s uncrewed test flight included hangups with a few of the spacecraft\u2019s thrusters that did not power on as intended and software problems. None of those issues had a major impact on the test mission, however, and the vehicle was still able to complete its multi-day journey to the ISS and return safely back to Earth. Officials have, however, deemed those problems serious enough to require fixes before allowing crew on board the vehicle. Notably, the first attempt to send the Starliner on an orbital test run in late 2019 had to be cut short \u2014 taking the vehicle directly back to land rather than to an ISS docking \u2014 after software issues sent the vehicle off course. It took nearly two years of troubleshooting before the Starliner was ready to return to the launch pad. Then, an issue with sticky valves further delayed the capsule\u2019s return to flight. Despite its setbacks, NASA has stood by Boeing, which is one of two companies \u2014 the other being SpaceX \u2014 that the space agency tapped to build an astronaut-worthy spacecraft after the Space Shuttle program retired in 2011. While even the space agency initially expected that Boeing, a decades-long partner of NASA\u2019s, would beat SpaceX to the launch pad, Boeing is now at least two years behind its relative upstart rival. But NASA wants at least two spacecraft capable to getting astronauts to the ISS and back in the hopes that, should either vehicle encounter a problem that would keep it grounded, there\u2019s always a backup transport option. But it should be noted that NASA can, and does, also rely on Russian-made Soyuz vehicles to get astronauts to the ISS and back. The two countries have ridesharing agreements that allow Russian cosmonauts and NASA astronauts to share seats on US or Russian vehicles, and that partnership has continued despite mounting geopolitical tensions.  NASA astronauts Barry \u2018Butch\u2019 Wilmore and Sunita Williams have been assigned to be the first astronauts to fly aboard Starliner next year.",

            "text": "Tesla\u2019s stock price is set to drop at the opening bell Thursday, but not because of anything Elon Musk tweeted about demand for electric vehicles, \u2018full self-driving\u2019 features, SpaceX updates, silly memes or his legal battle with Twitter.  The electric car company completed a 3-for-1 stock split after the closing bell Wednesday. So one share now costs a third of what it did a day ago. Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) closed around $891 on Wednesday, which means it was trading a little under $300 Thursday. Tesla approved the split in June, its second such split in the past two years. But before you start celebrating about how one Tesla share is now \u201ccheaper,\u201d keep in mind that nothing changes with Tesla\u2019s valuation. The company is still worth more than $930 billion after the split. Shares continue to trade at a lofty multiple of more than 70 times 2022 earnings forecasts \u2014 a huge premium to the valuations of traditional auto companies like Ford\n            \n                (F), GM\n            \n                (GM), Volkswagen\n            \n                (VLKAF) and Toyota\n            \n                (TM).  And the stock is still down about 15% this year, as investors worry about growing competition in the EV market from traditional automakers as well as Musk\u2019s many possible distractions. (SpaceX. The Boring Company. The Twitter\n            \n                (TWTR) takeover soap opera. The list goes on.) The only thing that the stock split changed is that existing investors now own three times as many shares of Tesla trading at one third of the price they ended at on Wednesday.  That includes Musk, the world\u2019s richest person with a net worth of about $264 billion, according to Forbes. Musk still owns approximately 15% of Tesla\u2019s common stock.  Companies with high share prices often split their stocks to make the cost of one share more affordable for individual investors. The rationale is that some investors might be more inclined to buy a stock if it is trading at a lower price. Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN), Shopify\n            \n                (SHOP), Google owner Alphabet\n            \n                (GOOGL) and meme stock GameStop\n            \n                (GME) have all done splits in the past few months.

Atlanta-based ExpressJet operated over 450 aircraft at its peak. The airline was the world\u2019s biggest operator of Embraer ERJ145 aircraft, a regional jet, as recently as February 2020, but pandemic-induced woes proved a fatal blow for the regional carrier.  After acquiring the company from SkyWest Airlines in 2018, United Airlines decided in 2020 to end its flights with the airline amidst pandemic cutbacks. ExpressJet then shut down for around a year before relaunching as Aha!, but the reboot struggled to deal with rising costs and changing travel habits. United finally sold its 49.9% stake in ExpressJet parent company ManaAir in June. Over the past six months, ExpressJet has been flying as low-cost Aha! Airlines out of Reno-Tahoe International Airport to 11 cities across the western United States, as well as ad-hoc charter services. The company pointed to stifled growth, rising costs and lower revenue due to the pandemic as the reasons that led to bankruptcy, according to a press release Tuesday.",

            "title": "Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway wins OK to buy 50% Occidental stake",
            "text": " A US energy regulator on Friday gave Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKA), the company controlled by billionaire Warren Buffett, permission to buy up to 50% of oil company Occidental Petroleum\n            \n                (OXY) Corp\u2019s common stock. Occidental\u2019s share price soared 9.9%, closing up $6.41 at $71.29, after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said letting Berkshire add to its 20.2% stake was \u201cconsistent with the public interest.\u201d  Berkshire had applied to increase its stake on July 11, saying it would not hurt competition, undermine regulatory authority, or boost costs for consumers. FERC regulates the interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas and oil. The share price of Houston-based Occidental has more than doubled this year, benefiting from rising oil prices following Russia\u2019s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Berkshire began buying Occidental shares four days later.  Buffett\u2019s Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock, which helped finance the 2019 purchase of Anadarko Petroleum Corp, and has warrants to buy another 83.9 million common shares for $5 billion. Berkshire also ended June with a $23.7 billion stake in a larger oil company, Chevron\n            \n                (CVX). \u201cBuffett is taking advantage of stock market participants who are foolish about the oil and gas industry and consider it a dead business,\u201d said Cole Smead, president of Smead Capital Management Inc in Phoenix, which owns Occidental and Berkshire shares. \u201cBuffett thinks it can make him wealthy.\u201d Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to Buffett\u2019s assistant.  Occidental spokesman Eric Moses said the higher ownership limit was \u201cnecessary\u201d because the company owned assets subject to FERC regulation. It said the prior limit was 25%. FERC\u2019s authorization does not require Berkshire to buy any Occidental shares. Some investors and analysts have nonetheless said Berkshire could eventually buy Occidental, diversifying an energy portfolio that includes several utilities, electricity distributors, and renewable power projects including wind. Buffett completed one of his biggest acquisitions, the $26.5 billion purchase of the BNSF railroad, in 2010 after Berkshire had amassed a 22.6% stake. Takeover? Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he \u201cliked Occidental more as a wholly-owned subsidiary under the Berkshire umbrella\u201d because it would reduce Occidental\u2019s costs to access capital, and reduce exposure to commodity markets volatility. Independent oil analyst Paul Sankey added that Occidental can benefit from the expanded tax credit for carbon-capture projects included in the Inflation Reduction Act signed this month by President Joe Biden. \u201cI can see him taking the whole thing private,\u201d Sankey said, referring to Buffett. Smead, in contrast, said Buffett is unlikely to buy all of Occidental soon, and can instead buy more shares on the open market at lower prices than in a full takeover. \u201cIn the long run, he may, but you don\u2019t file something like this with FERC if you\u2019re planning it in the next six months,\u201d Smead said. Berkshire ended June with $105.4 billion of cash and equivalents, even after buying a net $45.2 billion of stocks in the year\u2019s first half.  Buffett has pledged to keep $30 billion on hand. Occidental\u2019s market value was about $66 billion after Friday\u2019s run-up. Berkshire owns more than 90 companies outright, including Geico car insurance, See\u2019s Candies, Dairy Queen ice cream, and several manufacturing businesses. At Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting on April 30, Buffett said he began buying Occidental shares after reviewing an analyst presentation. He also expressed confidence in Chief Executive Vicki Hollub, who has been reducing Occidental\u2019s debt. \u201cShe says she doesn\u2019t know the price of oil next year. Nobody does,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cBut we decided it made sense.\u201d ",

            "title": "American Airlines agrees to purchase 20 supersonic jets",
            "text": "American Airlines is placing a bet on a future in which supersonic jets might return to the skies, shuttling passengers on some routes at speeds roughly twice as fast as current commercial aircraft. Exactly how big that bet is, however, remains unclear. American, which said it put down a deposit for up to 20 supersonic jets with the option to buy up to 20 more, declined to share the financial terms of the deal, which was announced Tuesday.  It all depends, however, on if the company slated to build the jets, Boom Supersonic, can make good on its lofty promises. Experts have questioned whether supersonic jets are likely to make a return.  Boom is developing a jet called the Overture that the company says will be able to carry 65 to 80 passengers at nearly twice the speed of sound.  But the jet is still in the early stages of development. Boom recently unveiled a \u201crefined\u2019 version of the aircraft, which it said has completed some wind tunnel tests. It has yet to conduct a test flight, however, and the first production vehicles aren\u2019t expected to roll off the line until 2025, according to a press release. The Overture is reminiscent of the Concorde, the ultra-quick \u2014 and exceedingly pricey \u2014 jet that shuttled people across the Atlantic Ocean for as much as $10,000 a seat. The Concorde, notably, was taken out of service in 2003 because the economics simply didn\u2019t work. The fuel-guzzling jet was too noisy to fly over land because its high speeds would generate deafening sonic booms, relegating it to trips across the ocean, like its popular London to New York City route.  Experts have said jets like the Concorde aren\u2019t likely to make a return, in part because these jets would need to find enough customers willing to fork over the premium price point. But that hasn\u2019t stopped Boom, American, and United Airlines \u2014 which announced plans to buy up to 15 of Boom\u2019s jets last year \u2014 from putting cash and marketing power behind plans to revive supersonic air travel. Boom says its jets could enter service by 2029, and, though they won\u2019t be able to hit top speeds over land, they could still travel as much as 20% faster than current commercial jets, the company claims.   \u201cFlying from Miami to London in just under five hours and Los Angeles to Honolulu in three hours are among the many possibilities,\u201d Boom claims. But foreign regulators and the US Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates commercial airlines, will have to approve the jets first. And it\u2019s not clear when or if that will happen. After the economic failure of the Concorde, both airlines and aircraft makers have generally concentrated on greater efficiency, not speed. Boeing, for example, ditched its plans for a near-supersonic jet, the Sonic Cruiser, in the early 2000s and shifted its focus to developing a lightweight, fuel-efficient jumbo jet, the 787 Dreamliner. (The 787, of course, has its own issues.) The US government, however, has shown interest in reviving supersonic jets. The FAA states on its website that it\u2019s currently working to establish new rules of the road for such aircraft, including allowable noise levels over land. And NASA has put money into developing a \u201cquiet\u201d supersonic jet, called the X-59, in the hopes of passing that tech on to the commercial sector. But even the first prototype has yet to take flight, with the first test not expected until later this year.",

As for Paramount, its service will likely get a boost in customers by being tied to a bundle from a major retailer like Walmart.  For consumers, it\u2019s also pretty good deal, considering it includes a Paramount+ Essential subscription, which normally costs $4.99 a month, bundled within Walmart+\u2019s $12.95 a month price tag.  \u201cWith the addition of Paramount+, we are demonstrating our unique ability to help members save even more and live better by delivering entertainment for less, too,\u201d Chris Cracchiolo, senior vice president and general manager of Walmart+, said in a statement Monday. \u201cParamount+ has the premium content and broad appeal that our members are looking for \u2014 like Walmart, they have something for everyone.\u201d The move is just the latest in the bundling evolution of the streaming world.

The airline said the move is \u201cin line with our approach to network and schedule planning throughout the year.\u201d Schedule data provided by Cirium shows the largest cuts are between Chicago O\u2019Hare and Dallas-Fort Worth, as well as between Boston and Philadelphia. \u201cPreliminary schedules are published 331 days in advance and then adjustments are made closer in based on the schedule we intend to operate,\u201d American said to CNN in a statement. \u201cWe are now loading schedule adjustments approximately 100 days in advance, which is in line with how we adjusted our schedule in 2019 prior to the pandemic.\u201d Last week, CNN reported that American is cutting 2% of its flights in September and October.  American Airlines called the changes \u201cproactive adjustments\u201d in order to \u201csize our airline for the resources we have available and to build additional buffer into the remainder of our summer schedule.\u201d Airlines make changes based on factors such as demand forecasts or staffing, said Mike Arnot, an industry commentator and spokesman for Cirium. \u201cFor passengers, the impact might be negligible; instead of 15 flights a day between Dallas and Chicago, there might be nine flights but with more bums in the seats,\u201d Arnot said. American isn\u2019t the only US airline to trim its schedule.  United Airlines recently cut its schedule at Newark, New Jersey, and Delta cut its summer schedule early in the season.  Airlines have been struggling with flight cancellations and delays this summer as they face staffing shortages, severe weather and air traffic control delays.

            "text": "United Airlines gave a $10 million deposit to a startup developing electric aircraft \u2014 all for the goal of shuttling customers to and from the airport by air rather than gridlocked roadways. It\u2019s not clear when or if the plan will come to fruition, as Archer, the company developing the electric air taxis, is still in the development phase. However, the company said Wednesday that\u2019s it\u2019s finishing the design of its production model. Archer estimates the first of its four-seater helicopters could be in operation by 2024.  California-based Archer, which was founded in 2018, has raised nearly a billion dollars, according to analytics company Crunchbase. It refers to its aircraft as an eVTOL, or \u201celectric vertical takeoff and landing\u201d configuration. The company states they\u2019ll be able to travel up to 60 miles at up to 150 miles per hour. The aircraft is expected to lift off much like a helicopter, and it\u2019ll rotate its propellers from providing vertical to horizontal thrust while airborne, and then rely on conventional wings to keep it in the air as it moves forward.  The company claims its vehicles will be able to land on helicopter pads and more general infrastructure such as the tops of parking garages, according to its website. It also claims the eVTOLs will be quieter than traditional helicopters, clocking in at 45 dBA, which would be softer than the ambient sound of an urban downtown.  Archer is conducting weekly test flights of its earliest vehicle, according to its website, but whether the future includes skies dotted with electric taxis depends on whether Archer can get past several major hurdles. The company has to prove its electric-powered aircraft work can be produced on an affordable scale and get regulatory approval to take to the skies.  Archer CEO Adam Goldstein said on CNN\u2019s New Day on Thursday that he intends to get all the necessary regulatory approval by 2024, citing recent comments from the head of the Federal Aviation Administration. \u201cWe want to be very careful. We want to be very measured,\u201d FAA acting administrator Billy Nolen said recently on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d about approving aircraft like the ones Archer is producing. But \u201cthis is real. This is happening. We\u2019ve come a long way from where we were just a mere decade ago.\u201d United plans to use the aircraft to transport customers on short trips to and from the airport, citing in one financial filing that it could \u201creduce CO2 emissions by 47% on a trip between Hollywood and Los Angeles International Airport.\u201d The initial $10 million deposit is for 100 of the vehicles, with the overall deal expected to total $1 billion if Archer can deliver on its promises. \u201cThese are trips that are less than 100 miles and we\u2019ll use these aircraft to replace trips on the ground that are taking 60 to 90 minutes,\u201d Goldstein said, citing the trek from Manhattan to Newark airport in New Jersey as an example.  A United spokesperson, however, notes that the Hollywood to LAX and the Manhattan to Newark routes are just an example, and United has not yet laid out specific plans for where it will roll out the service.  Still, there may be other hurdles. Archer will need to find a large enough customer base that can afford its services, scale its business, sell the public on the safety of its aircraft, and, of course, do it all without running out of cash. United, which has billed its partnership with Archer as part of its effort to be a carbon neutral company by 2050, first touted its plans to help get the aircraft off the ground in February 2021, and they set up a joint committee to allow the companies to share resources.",

            "title": "The A380\u2019s biggest supporter is asking Airbus to build a new super jumbo",
            "text": "The A380 super jumbo has many supporters around the world, but none quite as vocal and powerful as Tim Clark, the president of Emirates, by far the largest operator of the aircraft. The Dubai-based airline purchased nearly half of all A380s ever produced and now has 118 in its fleet, about 80 of which are currently flying.  The entire fleet will be back in the air by spring of next year, as part of a resurgence that has seen the super jumbo reintroduced into service with many of its operators, after the pandemic led many to believe it was ready for retirement. \u201cThe notion that the A380 was a spent force was always a little bit of a difficult one for us to swallow,\u201d Clark told CNN Travel in an exclusive interview.  \u201cI was chuckling to myself, thinking \u2018Wait and see.\u2019 We started flying the A380 into Heathrow six times a day in October of last year, and we haven\u2019t had a [free] seat on any of them since.\u201d The airline will start refreshing the interiors of almost 70 of its A380s later this year, adding a new premium economy class that will slightly reduce passenger capacity from 519 to 484.   Shower spa experience The most distinctive feature of Emirates\u2019 super jumbo, however, will remain the legendary shower spa, which offers first class passengers the luxury of a full-fledged shower at 35,000 feet.  There are two such suites, at the front of the upper deck, and Emirates is the only airline to offer them, after Clark explicitly requested them during the final design phase of the plane, in the early 2000s. \u201cAirbus had come up with a fairly sad possibility of putting benches and having little lounges there, but the notion that you would have bathrooms with showers and all the other bits and pieces was an interesting one,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a bit of a risk for us, but these were dead spaces which we couldn\u2019t generate income from. I realized that actually they would be hugely popular.\u201d  Convincing Airbus to install them, however, wasn\u2019t easy. \u201cWe designed the showers and then went to Airbus, who were very much arms folded at that time,\u201d Clark adds. \u201cBut prior to the A380\u2019s launch, the marketing program showed double page spreads with avenues of shops, lounges and cafes, so naturally I said, \u2018that shouldn\u2019t be a problem for you.\u2019  \u201cClearly it was, but because we were such a big buyer, they complied. And it\u2019s no mean feat trying to get water up two decks, keep the pressure up, the heating and all that.  \u201cBut we succeeded, they worked with us, and the rest is history. People talked about these showers for years and they still do.\u201d A new A380? Clark has long lamented the fact that neither Airbus or Boeing plan to build a new plane the size of the A380.  Currently, the largest planes offered by the two leading manufacturers are the Airbus A350-1000 and the upcoming 777-9, which both seat just over 400 people in a standard configuration.  However, deliveries of these planes have been delayed and Clark believes they are too small to replace the A380 in Emirates\u2019 fleet. \u201cThe math tells you that you need a big unit, much bigger than we\u2019re getting at the moment,\u201d he says.  \u201cThe biggest one will be the 777-9, whenever that comes to market, which in our configuration [will seat] 364 people against 484 on the A380s with our new premium economy. And it was 519 before, so you get where I\u2019m coming from.\u201d The \u201cmath\u201d Clark refers to comes from demand for air travel, which he says was growing by about 4.5% per year before the pandemic. Assuming that curve is recaptured, it would take just 10 to 15 years to see demand increase by half.  \u201cEven with multiple 787s and A350s all busy flying around the world, I still don\u2019t get how you will pick up that growth curve,\u201d says Clark.  \u201cSupply will be suppressed, demand will continue to grow, and when that happens prices rise, it\u2019s inevitable.  \u201cIf you take the A380s out of the frame by the mid-2030s, how are you going to make it work? Do we see massive upgrades of airfields or new airfields?  \u201cAt Heathrow, they can\u2019t even agree on the third runway. [Amsterdam\u2019s] Schiphol has just reduced the number of landings and takeoffs that they will allow. So, one wonders, how would this demand be accommodated?\u201d \u2018Open fan\u2019 engine Clark\u2019s answer is a new plane as big as the A380, if not bigger, with modern features such as lightweight composite materials and more efficient engines. \u201cIs it possible to redesign a new A380? Yes. Is it possible to lighten the aircraft? Yes. When they brought this aircraft to market, composites weren\u2019t really [widespread],\u201d says Clark.  \u201cImagine a composite wing and a predominantly composite fuselage. Imagine engines that are giving you a 20 to 25% improvement compared to what you get today.  \u201cSo you get a lighter aircraft, far more fuel-efficient, which ticks all the boxes as far as the environmentalists are concerned.\u201d One of the A380\u2019s biggest drawbacks are its four engines, which are inefficient to today\u2019s standards and fuel prices. A new version would require an entirely new engine technology.  Clark says there are \u201cvery interesting studies\u201d going on in this field, but he adds that most of the research over the last 20 years has been focused on narrow-body aircraft.  An \u201copen fan\u201d engine, which appears to be a propeller but is actually a larger, unducted version of the fan found inside every modern jet engine, is one of the most promising new types of engines, and could cut fuel consumption and emissions by as much as 20%. It will be trialed on an A380 test plane.  However, it\u2019s not meant for the aircraft: Brand new planes will need to be designed to fit these engines, and at least in the beginning, they will most likely be single aisle aircraft, similar to the 737 and A320. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get everybody working on the big fans for the bigger aircraft as well,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you can get them to do what I think they could do in terms of fuel efficiency and power, then you have the makings of an airplane that would match or beat the economics of the [twin-engine aircraft] that we see today, by quite a long way.\u201d The problem with this plan is that just like the A380 wasn\u2019t popular with airlines, a similarly sized successor likely wouldn\u2019t be.  \u201cDo I think that airlines will step up and sign up to this project? Doubtful at this stage,\u201d says Clark. \u201cOn the one hand I\u2019m very keen to take a good hard look at this, on the other I\u2019m not optimistic that the stakeholders in the ecosystem are up for it.   Looking to the future \u201cThe airline industry is, rightly so, populated with people who are conservative in nature, because they\u2019ve lost their shirts \u2013 this has been a seriously bad time for air travel.  \u201cBut now, things are starting to look a lot better, demand is back. So they have the ability to think hard about the future.  \u201cWhether they\u2019ve got the appetite for it, I don\u2019t know. I know we have it.\u201d Geoff Van Klaveren, an aviation analyst and managing director of advisory at independent aviation consultancy IBA, agrees with Clark that there\u2019s a need for a larger plane, but also that it won\u2019t be easy to get one. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely room for a Boeing 747 replacement, but I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s enough demand to start a program for an aircraft larger than the A380.  \u201cA very large plane is key to Emirates\u2019 business model, because 70% of their passengers connect to other flights, but I don\u2019t think Airbus or Boeing will build one just for them,\u201d he says, adding that the most likely outcome is that even larger, higher capacity variants of the A350 and the 777 will be made instead. However, Clark will not be moved. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Airbus more than once,\u201d he says. \u201cI think they\u2019re beginning to take it a little bit more seriously, but at the moment they are concentrating on their single aisle planes and the A350 line.  \u201cI suspect people like [Airbus CEO] Guillaume Faury really would like to see something like this and recognizes what I could call the commercial imperative for it.  \u201cBut he is very much a technologist and will only do what his engineers and the technology will allow him to do.\u201d Looking at the post-pandemic travel chaos that is causing canceled flights, endless security lines and heaps of lost luggage, Clark isn\u2019t very optimistic. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see a continuation of this until the summer of next year,\u201d he says.  \u201cWe are not out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination. And as more markets like China, Japan and Korea open up, they will exacerbate the problem, unless the likes of Heathrow, Frankfurt and Amsterdam get their act together and start getting people into place.\u201d The Emirates boss says he\u2019s amazed at the resilience of the traveling public for putting up with all of this, but they\u2019ll have to be patient for a while longer. \u201cI see strong demand for the next year,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a patchy one, but my instinct is telling me the airline industry will be okay in a year\u2019s time and things will gradually become good when we get back into equilibrium \u2013 middle of next year, or end of next year.\u201d",

            "text": "As its invasion of Ukraine ticks towards its sixth month, Russia remains isolated from the international community. International brands are still boycotting the country, while airlines and nations are imposing flight bans and sanctions.  But one airline has decided to start a route back up to Russia, in response to what it says is passenger demand. Wizz Air Abu Dhabi has announced it will recommence flights from Abu Dhabi to Moscow, with tickets now on sale from October 3.    Founded in December 2019, the company is an Emirati subsidiary of Wizz Air, one of Europe\u2019s fastest-growing budget airlines, which is based in Hungary. Wizz Air owns a 49% stake, with the majority 51% going to state-owned ADQ. Wizz has one other subsidiary, Wizz Air UK, which was originally set up to mitigate problems deriving from Brexit.  A spokesperson for Wizz Air said in a statement: \u201cWizz Air Abu Dhabi is a national UAE carrier that operates in line with the UAE\u2019s national regulations and policies. The airline is resuming its operation to Moscow to meet travel demand for passengers wishing to fly to and from Russia from the UAE capital. All UAE national airlines are currently operating direct flights to Russia.\u201d   It added: \u201cWizz Air Hungary and Wizz Air UK are not currently operating flights to Russia.\u201d Flights to Russia from the UK and EU are currently banned. Etihad, Emirates and FlyDubai are among the airlines operating to Russia from the UAE. Wizz had initially launched the route in December 2021, before suspending it when Russia invaded Ukraine.  Whether passengers will understand the difference between the airlines has yet to be seen, however. Mark Borkowski, a crisis PR consultant, told CNN that it could go wrong for the airline \u2013 and he said that Wizz\u2019s rivals will be watching closely. \u201cWe now begin to see a number of brands beginning to check their resolve, and as events drag on the virtue-signaling will give way to commercial intent,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect this decision will be viewed with great interest. It could be a disaster \u2013 however the bigger issue is fatigue. Certain commercial interests will prevail. Nevertheless it\u2019s a risky move that could turn into a profound PR own goal\u201d \u2013 a soccer term, meaning a self-inflicted disaster. The airline is having a difficult summer. In June, Wizz Air CEO J\u00f3zsef V\u00e1radi was recorded telling airline staff to push through fatigue during the summer chaos. Pilot unions were up in arms about what they said were the potential safety risks of his comments. Wizz Air Hungary \u2013 the umbrella organization \u2013 is currently offering 100,000 free flights for Ukrainian passport holders across its network. ",

            "text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk sold 7.9 million shares of Tesla in recent days, raising $6.9 billion with the sales. The sales from Friday through Tuesday were disclosed in a series of filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Tuesday night. They mark the first sale of Tesla shares by Musk since April, when he sold 9.6 million shares, raising $8.5 billion at that time. Those April sales came soon after Musk had reached a deal to buy Twitter\n            \n                (TWTR) for $44 billion. But a month ago he announced that he does not plan to go through with that deal, arguing that Twitter\n            \n                (TWTR) management did not disclose material information about how many user accounts were bots and spam accounts rather than accounts run by actual people. Twitter\n            \n                (TWTR) quickly sued to force Musk to go ahead with the deal on the terms reached in April. Musk\u2019s filings did not disclose the reason for the stock sales. But after someone on Twitter asked him if he was done selling Tesla shares, he responded \u201cYes\u201d and then pointed to the possibility of being forced to buy Twitter as the reason for this latest sale. \u201cIn the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close *and* some equity partners don\u2019t come through, it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock,\u201d he said in his tweet. But at the time he sold the Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) shares in April, he tweeted \u201cNo further TSLA sales planned after today.\u201d When someone else asked on Twitter Tuesday if he would repurchase Tesla shares if the Twitter deal does not close, he replied \u201cYes.\u201d Shares of Tesla have lost nearly 20% of their value so far this year, although they have rebounded 14% since reporting earnings in late July. Tesla\u2019s stock rose about 2% in premarket trading. Shares of Twitter were up nearly 4%. \u201cThis is the last thing Tesla investors wanted to see,\u201d said Daniel Ives, tech analyst for Wedbush Securities. \u201cThe biggest fear has been that Musk sells more stock, and that\u2019s what just happened. It\u2019s a near-term gut punch. There\u2019s no explanation and that adds to the uncertainty.\u201d Musk has previously sold Tesla shares primarily when he needed to raise cash to pay taxes on the exercise of options that were due to expire. The sales of stock in April soon after the Twitter deal was reached was the first significant sale of Tesla shares by Musk for reasons other than a looming tax bill. Musk received an average price of $869 a share for the shares he sold in recent days. That\u2019s down from an average price of $883 a share on his Tesla sales in April, and well below the $1,046 average that he received when selling 15.7 million shares late last year. That sale was to cover an expected record personal income tax bill which he faced as a result of exercising options that had been set to expire. Even with the latest stock sales, Musk owns 155 million shares of Tesla, and has options to buy nearly 100 million more at a fraction of current prices. The shares he owns, combined with the options he holds to buy other shares, gives him control over about 20% of Tesla outstanding shares. And the 7.9 million shares he just sold represent less than 3% of the shares and options he holds.",

But the Oracle of Omaha is undeterred by the wildness on Wall Street. Berkshire Hathaway is still buying and many of the the company\u2019s diverse business lines are still thriving, even in these uncertain economic times. Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKB) reported Saturday that the massive conglomerate posted a net loss of nearly $44 billion in the second quarter, red ink that was due mostly to a big drop in the value of Berkshire\u2019s significant stock portfolio.  Berkshire owns large stakes in Apple\n            \n                (AAPL), Bank of America\n            \n                (BAC), Coca-Cola\n            \n                (KO), Chevron\n            \n                (CVX) and American Express\n            \n                (AXP). Those five stocks make up nearly 70% of the portfolio. Chevron\n            \n                (CVX) and Coke have both rallied this year but tech stocks and financials have been significant market losers. But the steep loss in the value of Berkshire\u2019s portfolio is not the whole story. The firm actually reported an operating profit of $9.3 billion in the quarter, up nearly 40% from a year ago.  That gain was due in part to higher interest rates boosting portions of its colossal insurance unit. There were also jumps in earnings from Berkshire\u2019s railroad, utility and energy businesses.  Berkshire owns Geico, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, PacifiCorp and MidAmerican Energy Company as well as big consumer brands such as Fruit of the Loom, Duracell, Dairy Queen and a large stake in Kraft Heinz\n            \n                (KHC). Big rebound for Berkshire in the past two years Berkshire\u2019s many businesses have bounced back sharply from the depths of the Covid-induced slowdown in the economy in 2020. \u201cBecause the Covid-19 pandemic negatively impacted most businesses, including Berkshire, in early 2020, comparing current results to pre-pandemic 2019 results is helpful\u201d Bill Stone, chief investment officer of the Glenview Trust Company and a Berkshire shareholder, said in a report. \u201cOperating earnings for the second quarter of 2022 are 51% above 2019.\u201d  But many investors pay close attention to Berkshire to see what Buffett, vice chairman Charlie Munger and top Berkshire investing lieutenants Ted Weschler and Todd Combs think about the stock market. Apparently they remain bullish.  Berkshire reported about $3.8 billion in net stock purchases during the second quarter. That\u2019s on top of the more than $40 billion in stocks Berkshire bought during the first quarter.  Buffett\u2019s firm also bought back $1 billion of its own shares during the quarter, a move that helps boost earnings per share.  Berkshire has been aggressive throughout the market downturn, scooping up a sizable stake in oil giant Occidental Petroleum\n            \n                (OXY) and announcing an $11.6 billion deal for insurer Alleghany earlier this year. The company\u2019s stock has held up better than the rest of the market in 2022. The super pricy class A shares, which trade for around $445,000 apiece because they don\u2019t split, are down about 2%. So are the shares of the class B stock, which cost a little less than $300 each and are in the S&P 500. CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said in a report after the earnings release that she sees \u201cstable results in most segments\u201d for Berkshire.  Shares of both classes of Berkshire Hathaway were up slightly in early morning trading Monday. Buffett, who will turn 92 on August 30, has given no indication that he plans to step back from his roles as Berkshire CEO and top portfolio manager just yet.  But the company has already announced that Greg Abel, the 60-year old vice chairman of all of Berkshire\u2019s energy and other non-insurance units, will eventually take over for Buffett. ",

            "text": "US airlines just had one of the most lucrative quarters in history. Passengers are suffering for it. The record revenue many airlines reported in April, May and June came via very high airfares and packed airplanes. A series of service disruptions caused by staffing shortages has made flying even worse. In the second quarter, American Airlines\n            \n                (AAL), United\n            \n                (UAL), Delta\n            \n                (DAL) and Southwest\n            \n                (LUV), which account for 80% of US air travel, earned a combined $2.8 billion. Sales jumped 10% from the same quarter of 2019, before the pandemic, to $46 billion, as demand for leisure travel surged. The airlines reported record bookings in June for travel during the rest of the summer. But carriers are flying with fewer seats available than before the pandemic: capacity at the four largest airlines is down about 13% from three years ago.  That combination of very strong demand and limited availability sent fares soaring. Soaring fares, canceled flights The amount passengers paid to fly each mile on the big four carriers was up 19.3% in the second quarter compared to 2019. Another measure of fares that compares passenger revenue to capacity rose 22%.  But those increases don\u2019t tell the whole story. Business and international travel hasn\u2019t returned to pre-pandemic levels. Those tickets typically cost much more than domestic airfare. Unlike previous years, when airlines could avoid some fare hikes for leisure travelers by jacking up tickets for business and international passengers, this year the bulk of fare increases are hitting domestic fliers. \u201cThe leisure traveler is taking it on the chin right now and they\u2019re willing to do so,\u201d said Jim Corridore, senior insights manager for research firm Similarweb. Service has become a massive problem as well.  About 134,000 US flights have been canceled so far this year, according to tracking service Flight Aware, more than twice as many as were canceled in the same period last year. That represents 2.6% of all scheduled flights so far this year.  Staffing shortage also hitting passengers Airlines don\u2019t have sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they\u2019re allowed to work under federal safety regulations. The shortage of pilots has also prompted airlines to stop or slash service to dozens of smaller markets, greatly limiting or even ending air service for many communities. During the pandemic, carriers offered early retirement and other buyout packages to make voluntary reductions in staffing. All of them are still struggling to get operations back to normal as they scramble to hire and train the staff necessary to restore capacity.  \u201cA lot of pilots retired. It\u2019s not easy to replace them,\u201d said Corridore. \u201cIt\u2019s a long process, it\u2019s still going to be a year or so to have the airlines have a full schedule that this level of demand will dictate.\u201d Complaints also soar Passenger complaints to the Department of Transportation have soared to more than triple pre-pandemic levels.  Senators Elizabeth Warren and Alex Padilla urged Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg last month to crack down on the airline industry. The Department of Transportation announced new rules Wednesday that would require refunds if a flight is canceled or disrupted, including three-hour or longer delays on domestic flights, six-hour delays on international flights, a change in aircraft type or an increase in the number of connections on a trip.  But in a deregulated industry, there\u2019s little Buttigieg can do about the fares themselves. Mergers mean fewer choices Many blame the consolidation in the industry over the last 20 years for the current state of travel. Today\u2019s four dominant carriers were created from 10 airlines through a series of mergers. And another merger was just announced last week that many fear will once again lead to higher prices.  Spirit\n            \n                (SAVE), a pioneer in offering very low base fares which are then supplemented by fees for all manner of extras, had put pressure on the bigger airlines to offer similar frill-free seats at a lower price.  But Spirit recently agreed to be purchased by JetBlue Airways\n            \n                (JBLU) for $3.8 billion in cash. The combination will form the country\u2019s fifth largest airline, which JetBlue says will create more competition among its four larger rivals. But other experts say the loss of Spirit, if the merger is approved, can only mean higher fares down the road. \u201cFares are likely to rise if a disruptive price competitor is going away,\u201d Corridore said.",

            "text": "Alibaba just posted flat revenue growth for the first time since becoming a public company, but investors don\u2019t seem to mind. Shares of the Chinese tech and e-commerce giant jumped more than 6% in premarket trading in New York on Thursday. Its stock in Hong Kong had earlier closed up 5.2%. The pop came despite the company reporting revenue of nearly 205.6 billion yuan (about $30.4 billion) in the quarter ended June, roughly in line with what it recorded the same time last year.  But that topped analysts forecasts, and net income was also better than expected, at 22.7 billion yuan ($3.4 billion).  Alibaba\n            \n                (BABA), which owns the hugely popular Taobao and Tmall online shopping platforms, was not immune from the economic pain of Covid-19 lockdowns across China earlier this year. The company said its retail sales slumped in April and May, particularly as Shanghai and other major Chinese cities dealt with crippling pandemic restrictions that scuttled consumer demand and created logistical nightmares. But since June, business has picked back up, particularly \u201cas logistics and the supply chain situation gradually improved after Covid restrictions eased,\u201d said CEO Daniel Zhang. On a conference call Thursday, Zhang said the company had seen glimmers of recovery in categories like fashion and electronics, which were hit hard earlier on. Despite growth virtually skidding to a halt, Zhang sought to put a good spin on the latest results, noting the company had overcome \u201csoft economic conditions\u201d to \u201cdeliver stable revenues.\u201d However, he warned of a rocky road ahead, pointing to wider economic risks.  \u201cThe external uncertainties, including but not limited to international geopolitical dynamics, Covid resurgence, and China\u2019s macroeconomic policies and social trends, are beyond what we as a company can influence,\u201d Zhang told analysts. \u201cThe only things we can do at this moment is to focus on improving ourselves,\u201d he said, adding that Alibaba had focused on narrowing losses across businesses such as its supermarket and food delivery units. But Alibaba has faced bigger questions lately, particularly after its addition to a key US Securities and Exchange Commission watchlist last Friday. Similar to other Chinese firms, the move puts the tech titan at risk of being ejected from Wall Street if US auditors can\u2019t fully inspect its financial statements. Alibaba has long had a primary listing in New York, where its shares have traded since a massive IPO in 2014.  Now, it appears to be spreading its bets. Last week, the company announced plans to upgrade its secondary listing in Hong Kong to a primary listing. The change could take place by the end of this year, and would give more mainland Chinese investors access to the stock. That comes just as one of Alibaba\u2019s biggest longtime backers is seen to be pulling back. The Financial Times reported Thursday that SoftBank\n            \n                (SFTBF) had \u201csold more than half\u201d of its holdings in the Chinese company, citing filings of forward sales seen by the newspaper.  SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

            "text": "The Reddit retail army is back.  A little-known Hong Kong-based company appears to have become the latest obsession of traders on the popular Reddit forum WallStreetBets, helping its stock shoot up 21,000% since its IPO less than a month ago.  Shares of AMTD Digital have spiked nearly 3,000% over the past week, and were up 126% on Tuesday alone. The company debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on July 15, listing its shares at $7.80 apiece. Since then, the price has jumped to $1,679.  AMTD Digital is a financial services startup that trades on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol \u201cHKD.\u201d The company is an arm of AMTD Idea Group, an investment bank based in Hong Kong that is also listed in New York and Singapore. The unit was founded in 2019, and provides fintech services in Asia, including a virtual bank called Airstar. AMTD Digital brought in just over $25 million in revenue last year, according to a regulatory filing. And yet this week its market cap is more than $310 billion, surpassing that of Shell\n            \n                (RDSA) and Costco\n            \n                (COST) and putting it closer to the size of Walmart\n            \n                (WMT) and Exxon\n            \n                (XOM). Even the company was scratching its head over the sudden surge. \u201cTo our knowledge, there are no material circumstances, events nor other matters relating to our company\u2019s business and operating activities since the IPO date,\u201d the company said in a statement Tuesday. Its parent company has also benefited from the mania. AMTD Idea Group was the No. 1 trade on Fidelity\u2019s platform on Tuesday, and its stock jumped nearly 237% in New York. The frenzy is reminiscent of the January 2021 run-up in shares of GameStop\n            \n                (GME) and AMC\n            \n                (AMC), which both saw historic upticks after retail investors on the subreddit WallStreetBets seized on what they saw as the companies\u2019 undervalued stocks.  One user on the forum pointed to the similarities Wednesday, asking whether this was \u201canother GameStop AMC situation.\u201d  \u201cWhere did AMTD Digital come from,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d There appeared to be no specific reason for the rally, other than online users in recent days calling for people to pile into the shares.  It worked: on Tuesday, the company was one of the most traded stocks on Fidelity, according to the investment firm. ",

            "title": "What it\u2019s like inside Boeing\u2019s new 777X",
            "text": "Described as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest and most efficient twin-engine jet,\u201d the Boeing 777X was originally scheduled to enter into service in 2020, but the launch of the jetliner has been beset by delays. Now expected to debut in 2025, the airplane\u2019s most striking exterior feature is undoubtedly its folding wingtips \u2013 a first for commercial aviation. But what will it look like from the inside? This month, Boeing proudly showcased a test-version of the 777-9X, one of two 777X variants, at the Farnborough Airshow, a UK-based aviation trade event, providing a hint of what passengers can expect. The 777 has been a big success for Boeing since it began service in 1995, and remains the best selling wide-body aircraft. The 777X follows on from the popular but aging 777-300ER, and looks set to become one of the aircraft manufacturer\u2019s key airliners.   One of the most noticeable things about the experimental plane, aside from the fact that it\u2019s filled with monitoring equipment, is just how huge it is. Enormous aircraft  Measuring 251 feet, the aircraft can seat 426 passengers in a standard two-class configuration, and is longer than both its predecessor the 777-300ER (242 feet 4 inches) and the Airbus A350-1000, which has a length of just over 242 feet. In the demonstrator plane, much of the space inside the cabin is currently taken up by testing stations, along with huge water tanks used to balance the aircraft during test conditions.  Although the aircraft has the same external width as the 777, its side walls are thinner, so there\u2019s enough room for 10 18-inch wide seats in economy. Then there\u2019s the windows. Not only are they about 16% larger than those on the 777, they\u2019ve also been installed higher on the fuselage to provide passengers with more natural light and a better view. There were no overhead bins on show inside the demonstrator 777-9X, but Boeing has stated that those fitted on board will be able to hold twice as much as normal bins and require 40% less force to close. According to Boeing, the best features of the 777 and 787 Dreamliner families have been brought together for the 777X, with added advancements, and the similarities are obvious. Bigger windows  \u201cIt has the same passenger features as the Dreamliner,\u201d explains Julie O\u2019Donnell from the Boeing Commercial Airplanes Communications team. \u201cSo the LED lighting and the better humidity.\u201d Like the Dreamliner, the 777X can maintain a lower cabin altitude of 6,000 feet, which \u201chelps with fatigue,\u201d a member of the flight testing team tells CNN Travel during a tour of the aircraft, along with improved technology to \u201ccounteract turbulence.\u201d The 775,000 pound plane is fitted with General Electric GE9X engines, the most powerful engines ever mounted on a commercial airliner. These burn 10% less fuel than those used on current 777s. Inside the cockpit, the flight deck incorporates touchscreen displays that can support multiple touch points, allowing two pilots to interact with their section of the lower display simultaneously. James Hanley, one of the test pilots on board the aircraft, was full of praise for the \u201cmodern\u201d system, indicating that it\u2019s been a hit with pilots. Rigorous test program One of the many controls fitted inside is used to operate the plane\u2019s folding wings, which have a span of just over 233 feet (71 meters). The carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer wings were specifically designed to enable the aircraft to fit into the same gates, taxiways and runways as the 777. While this design feature isn\u2019t unusual on Navy fighter jets built for landing on an aircraft carrier, this is the first time folding wingtips have been fitted on a commercial airliner. As a result, the US Federal Aviation Administration has drafted new regulations for the 777-9X and the 777-8X, its sister aircraft. The 777-9 has been undergoing \u201crigorous\u201d flight testing, both on the ground and in the air, and has been making good progress, according to the testing team. The plane took its maiden flight back in January 2020 and now has more than 2,400 flight hours logged. Aerial show It wasn\u2019t just part of the static display at the first Farnborough Airshow to be held since 2019. Attendees were treated to a spectacular aerial display in which the aircraft took flight at a near-vertical angle, before performing a number of impressive maneuvers, much to the delight of the crowd below. \u201cI never get tired of watching people see the airplane fly,\u201d O\u2019Donnell told CNN Travel shortly before the awe-inspiring show. The aircraft is now back at Seattle\u2019s Boeing Field, and has \u201cresumed regular activities.\u201d This latest high profile appearance comes months after Boeing announced that its delivery had been pushed back to 2025 due to \u201can updated assessment of the time required to meet certification requirements\u201d Bigger orders? Boeing has received around 376 orders for the 777X. Qatar Airways will be the first airline to receive the aircraft, according to Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker, who told reporters at the Farnborough Airshow that he was considering putting in a \u201cbigger order.\u201d The state-owned flag carrier airline of Qatar went on to finalize an order for 25 of Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX 10 airliners, while Delta Air Lines announced that it plans to buy 100 of the largest variant of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max, which was also on display at the aerospace event. In March 2019, the MAX was grounded for 20 months following two fatal crashes. This was lifted in November 2020 after software updates and revised pilot training. Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal says the aerospace company has received \u201cstrong demand\u201d for the MAX since it returned to the skies.",

Alibaba\n            \n                (BABA) slid as much as 6% in Hong Kong on Monday morning, but then pared losses to 3.8% in the afternoon.  On Friday, Alibaba\u2019s US-listed shares plunged 11% after the Securities and Exchange Commission put the company on its watchlist.   Investors have been concerned about the tech giant for years now. In late 2020, Alibaba was caught up in a sweeping crackdown in China on the country\u2019s booming technology sector. The stock has fallen nearly 70% from its all-time high.  The crackdown, coupled with a weakening economy, has slowed the revenue growth for many tech companies and wiped out billions of dollars from Chinese companies\u2019 market cap.   The SEC has the power to kick companies off Wall Street if they fail to allow US watchdogs to inspect their financial audits for three straight years.  China has for years rejected US audits of its firms, citing national security concerns. It requires companies that are traded overseas to hold their audit papers in mainland China, where they cannot be examined by foreign agencies.  So far, the SEC has added more than 150 companies to its watch list, including Didi, JD.com\n            \n                (JD), Baidu\n            \n                (BIDU), and Yum China Holdings\n            \n                (YUMC). On Monday, Alibaba said it would monitor market developments and \u201cstrive to maintain its listing status on both the NYSE and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\u201d  Last week, the company announced it would seek a primary listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange, a move seen by many analysts as preparing for a potential loss of direct access to US capital market. Currently, Alibaba has a secondary listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange. \u201cA primary listing status in Hong Kong gives Chinese ADRs (American Depository Shares) an optionality to diversify their listing risk and retain access to the public equity market\u201d if they are forced to leave the United States, said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report last week. Alibaba\u2019s smooth transition of listing status could also \u201cset the path\u201d for many more Chinese ADRs to pursue a similar switch, Citi analysts said separately. \u2014 CNN Business\u2019 Julia Horowitz contributed to this report.",

            "text": "A union representing nearly 2,500 employees at three Boeing defense locations in the St. Louis area said on Saturday they will vote on the company\u2019s revised contract offer, canceling a strike that was set to start early Monday. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said an overnight bargaining session had led to the new Boeing offer and workers will vote Wednesday on whether to accept it. Under the new contract offer, employees can opt to receive an $8,000 lump sum payment \u2014 minus tax withholdings \u2014 upon ratification or can choose to have the entire amount deposited in a 401(k) plan. The company is dropping its revised 401(k) match proposal. Boeing said in a statement Saturday \u201cthis new offer builds on our previous strong, highly competitive one and directly addresses the issues raised by our employees. We are hopeful they will vote yes on Wednesday.\u201d The tentative deal does not necessarily mean that the risk of a strike is over. A number of companies have reached deals with union leadership, only to see rank-and-file workers reject the proposed contract, forcing a strike. That\u2019s what happened at John Deere where 10,000 members of the United Auto Workers union went on strike in October after rejecting a tentative deal.  They stayed on strike for five weeks, rejecting another tentative agreement along the way, before voting in favor of a third agreement and returning to work. Union members at the three Boeing defense plants overwhelmingly rejected the previous offer from the company a week ago. Workers at the three plants in Missouri and Illinois build the F-15, F-18, T-7A trainer, and the MQ-25 unmanned refueler. Boeing said on July 24 it was activating a contingency plan in the event of a strike. But CEO Dave Calhoun had told investors during a conference call this week that delays in deliveries to military customers would occur if there was a strike. The standoff began after the union had criticized Boeing\u2019s 401(k) payments in the contract and workers rejected the offer. \u201cBoeing previously took away a pension from our members, and now the company is unwilling to adequately compensate our members\u2019 401(k) plan,\u201d the union said on July 24. Boeing\u2019s earlier 401(k) offer on Sunday included a company match of workers contributions up to 10% of workers\u2019 salaries along with an automatic contribution of 2% for 2023 and 2024. Boeing had also offered a $3,000 ratification bonus. Boeing currently provides a 4% company contribution and a 75% match on the first 8% of an employee contribution. Boeing has posted deep losses each of the last three years, with net losses topping $18 billion since the start of 2019. But those losses were primarily related to its commercial aircraft business, which has been buffeted by the 20-month grounding of the 737 Max that started in March of 2019 following two fatal crashes, as well as a sharp drop in demand for air travel caused by the pandemic. The company\u2019s defense, space and security business unit posted a $1.5 billion profit each of the last two years. But Boeing reported a loss of $929 million in its defense business in the first quarter this year after a number of special charges, including a $660 million charge related to its refurbishment of two 747 jets to be used as the new Air Force Ones. Boeing posted a narrow $71 million profit in the second quarter. \u2013 CNN Business\u2019 Chris Isidore contributed to this report",

            "text": "The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Friday approved Boeing\u2019s inspection and modification plan to resume deliveries of 787 Dreamliners, two people briefed on the matter told Reuters.  The FAA approved Boeing\n            \n                (BA)\u2019s proposal that requires specific inspections to verify the condition of the airplane meets requirements and that all work has been completed, a move that should allow Boeing\n            \n                (BA) to resume deliveries in August after it halted them in May 2021, the sources said. On July 17, Boeing told reporters it was \u201cvery close\u201d to restarting 787 deliveries. The FAA referred questions about the approval to Boeing. \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on ongoing certifications,\u201d the agency said. Boeing did not confirm the approval Friday but said it \u201cwill continue to work transparently with the FAA and our customers towards resuming 787 deliveries.\u201d Boeing has faced production issues with the 787 for more than two years. In September 2020, the FAA said it was \u201cinvestigating manufacturing flaws\u201d in some 787 jetliners. In the aftermath of two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019, the FAA pledged to more closely scrutinize Boeing and delegate fewer responsibilities to Boeing for aircraft certification.  Boeing suspended deliveries of the 787 after the FAA raised concerns about its proposed inspection method. The FAA had previously issued two airworthiness directives to address production issues for in-service airplanes and identified a new issue in July 2021. Boeing Chief Financial Officer Brian West said this week on an investor call that it had 120 of the 787s in inventory and was \u201cmaking progress completing the necessary rework to prepare them for delivery.\u201d Boeing is \u201cproducing at very low rates and we\u2019ll continue to do so until deliveries resume, gradually returning to 5 airplanes per month over time.\u201d  The planemaker had only resumed deliveries in March 2021 after a five-month hiatus before halting them again. Friday\u2019s approval came after lengthy discussions with the FAA. The regulator had said it wanted Boeing to ensure it \u201chas a robust plan for the re-work that it must perform on a large volume of new 787s in storage\u201d and that \u201cBoeing\u2019s delivery processes are stable.\u201d The FAA said in February it would retain the authority to issue airworthiness certificates until it is confident \u201cBoeing\u2019s quality control and manufacturing processes consistently produce 787s that meet FAA design standards.\u201d The agency\u2019s then-administrator, Steve Dickson, told Reuters in February the FAA needed from Boeing \u201ca systemic fix to their production processes.\u201d  A plane built for American Airlines\n            \n                (AAL) is likely to be the first 787 airplane delivered by Boeing since May 2021, sources said. That could come as soon as next month. American Airlines\n            \n                (AAL) said last week on an earnings call it expects to receive nine 787s this year, including two in early August. Boeing in January disclosed a $3.5 billion charge due to 787 delivery delays and customer concessions, and another $1 billion in abnormal production costs stemming from production flaws and related repairs and inspections.",

            "text": "The House of Representatives on Thursday passed a long-awaited bill aimed at boosting US semiconductor production in a bid to increase American competitiveness, a bipartisan achievement that will send tens of billions of dollars into American manufacturing and scientific research. The final vote was 243-187 with one Democrat, Rep. Sara Jacobs of California, whose family founded the Qualcomm telecom company, voting present. Twenty-four Republicans crossed over to join Democrats in backing the bill, despite House GOP leadership whipping against the package.  The bill passed the Senate on Wednesday with broad bipartisan support, meaning it now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law. The vote was closer than originally anticipated. Following Senate Democrats\u2019 announcement of a deal on Wednesday evening for a separate economic package, Republican sources told CNN that House GOP leaders would whip against the semiconductor legislation, reversing their earlier stance.  The legislation is aimed at addressing a semiconductor chip shortage and making the US less reliant on other countries such as China for manufacturing. Supporters say the measure is important not only for US technological innovation, but for national security as well. There had been some concern among Democratic leaders that some progressives might oppose the bill, following opposition from independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.  Pramila Jayapal, the chairwoman for the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said Wednesday she hadn\u2019t whipped her members over the legislation, but highlighted discussions with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, whose been the Biden administration\u2019s chief advocate for the package, as a sign that progressives will likely back it. Raimondo met again with members of the Progressive Caucus just a few hours before the vote.  In the end, progressives joined the rest of the party in supporting the bill. The semiconductor bill sets up incentives for domestic semiconductor manufacturing as well as research and development and includes more than $50 billion in funding for that aim.  The legislation also includes a number of provisions aimed at bolstering scientific research, including authorizing billions of dollars for the National Science Foundation, the Department of Commerce and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Thursday. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify Rep. Sara Jacobs\u2019 relationship to Qualcomm.

            "title": "JetBlue announces a deal to buy Spirit Airlines. Fares could surge",
            "text": "JetBlue Airways on Thursday announced it would purchase Spirit Airlines, a combination that would create America\u2019s fifth-largest airline. The announcement comes a day after Spirit pulled the plug on a deal to merge with Frontier. JetBlue had been pursuing a hostile bid for Spirit even while Spirit sought shareholder approval for a lower-priced deal with Frontier. Spirit had continually expressed concern whether regulators would approve a deal with JetBlue. But shareholders had balked at accepting Frontier\u2019s less-valuable cash-and-stock offer when they had JetBlue\u2019s all-cash offer on the table. JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes said the deal will be fruitful for investors and passengers. \u201cWe are excited to deliver this compelling combination that turbocharges our strategic growth, enabling JetBlue to bring our unique blend of low fares and exceptional service to more customers, on more routes,\u201d he said in a statement. Higher fares But industry experts have said the deal could lead to higher fares across the industry. A Frontier-Spirit deal, by contrast, would have brought together two airlines that have very low base fares. Neither airline has first class or business class seats. The presence of Spirit or Frontier on a route typically forces larger airlines, such as American\n            \n                (AAL), United\n            \n                (UAL) and Delta\n            \n                (DAL), to offer more seats at their similar bare-bones basic economy fare. JetBlue may argue that it charges less than the larger network carriers, but its airfares are higher than Spirit and Frontier\u2019s. And JetBlue plans to reconfigure the Spirit planes if it acquires the airline to add first class seating. \u201cSpirit and Frontier play a big role in the fare you pay, even if you never fly either one,\u201d said Scott Keyes, founder of Scott\u2019s Cheap Flights, a web site that helps passengers find cheaper fares. \u201cWhen Delta announced the basic economy fare in 2012, they described it to investors as a \u2018Spirit-matching fare,\u2019 because their lunch was getting eaten by the budget carriers of the world. I\u2019m not a fan of either merger, but I like the JetBlue option even less.\u201d For that reason, it\u2019s possible that the JetBlue deal for Spirit will face strong antitrust scrutiny from the US Department of Justice, particularly if the Justice Department views the acquisition as harmful to consumers. The proposed JetBlue Spirit deal is smaller than many airline mergers of recent decades, which turned the 10 largest US airlines into four mega-carriers that control 80% of US air traffic. But the Biden administration has taken a much more aggressive stance on questions of antitrust law and vowed to promote greater competition within the airline industry. Biden\u2019s Justice Department sued to block an alliance between American and JetBlue that allows each airline to book passengers onto the other\u2019s flights. Spirit pointed to that legal action when arguing a JetBlue deal wouldn\u2019t get the necessary approval. More competition? But those doubts about a deal with JetBlue were nowhere to be found in Spirit\u2019s comments Thursday. \u201cWe are thrilled to unite with JetBlue through our improved agreement to create the most compelling national low-fare challenger to the dominant U.S. carriers,\u201d said CEO Ted Christie. In an interview on CNBC Thursday, Christie was pressed about the criticism he had about JetBlue\u2019s offer in the past, and his doubts about regulators approving the deal. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot over the last few months,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got an aggressive strategy to get this deal done. We\u2019re going to be right by their side making sure it happens, because it\u2019s good for our group. Some of the narrative is this is going to create a big national competitor to the Big Four.\u201d JetBlue\u2019s Hayes said the best argument for regulators is that this deal will provide another major national carrier and create more competition, not less. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on getting this deal done,\u201d he said on CNBC. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on bringing more airplanes in, offering more low fares and great product to customers in more geographies than JetBlue or Spirit could do alone.\u201d While passengers might like the low fares offered on Spirit and Frontier, they typically did not like the service. Spirit had by far the highest number of passenger complaints in 2021, with 11.45 complaints per 100,000 passengers, according to the US Department of Transportation. JetBlue had the second most complaints on that basis with 6.38, while Frontier came in third with 5.78. Frontier had by far the worst rate of complaints in 2020, when it recorded 49.31 complaints per 100,000 customers. The deal The deal announced Thursday would pay Spirit shareholders $33.50 per share in cash, including a prepayment of $2.50 per share in cash payable upon Spirit stockholders\u2019 approval of the transaction \u2014 even before the deal closes.  JetBlue will pay Spirit shareholders an additional 10 cents a month for any delay in closing after December of this year, which could raise the price to $34.15 a share. And if regulators block the deal, JetBlue will pay Spirit $70 million, and its shareholders would get an additional $400 million. Spirit will have to pay Frontier $25 million to cover costs Frontier incurred during merger discussions. If JetBlue is able to close its deal for Spirit within the next 12 months, Spirit will owe Frontier an additional $69 million. Wednesday evening when its deal with Spirit was terminated, Frontier expressed regret but vowed it will be able grow even without a merger. \u201cWith JetBlue seeking to convert Spirit Airlines into a high-cost airline, Frontier will be unmatched as the ultra-low cost leader,\u201d it said. If JetBlue\n            \n                (JBLU) closes the deal this year at $33.50, it\u2019ll be a 38% premium over Spirit\n            \n                (SAVE)\u2019s closing price Wednesday and about $1 billion more than Frontier\u2019s offer had been worth. Shares of Spirit\n            \n                (SAVE) were up 4% in premarket trading on the news, while JetBlue\n            \n                (JBLU) shares gained 1%.

            "text": "South Korea\u2019s homegrown KF-21 Boramae fighter jet flew for the first time on Tuesday, putting the country among the few nations to have developed and flown an advanced supersonic fighter. The prototype jet took a 33-minute roundtrip flight from an air force base in the southern city of Sacheon, said South Korea\u2019s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA). The pilot, Maj. Ahn Jun-hyun, admitted to being nervous beforehand, but said that after take off \u201ceverything went smoothly so I flew the whole flight route as planned.\u201d  The jet is the first of a fleet of six KF-21 prototypes made by Korea Aerospace Industries that will conduct more than 2,000 test flights from now until 2026, when mass production and deployment will begin, DAPA said. A total of 120 jets are expected to be delivered to the South Korean air force by 2030. Once operational, the KF-21 is expected to be armed with a range of air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles \u2013 and possibly even air-launched cruise missiles. The twin-engine fighters will come in single- and two-seat versions. On Tuesday, the jet was equipped with four mock-up Meteor air-to-air missiles and an infrared search-and-track system, and reached speeds of around 400 kilometers per hour (250 mph). South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said the test flight was \u201ca splendid achievement in national defense independence.\u201d The KF-21 is a joint project between South Korea and Indonesia in which Seoul holds 80% of shares. While only 65% of the KF-21\u2019s parts are of South Korean origin, its maiden flight still marks a significant achievement for a country that doesn\u2019t have a lengthy history of aircraft production. The only other countries to have developed and flown an advanced supersonic jet fighter are the United States, Russia, China, Japan, France, Sweden and a European consortium of the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Spain. Of those, only the US and China have deployed domestic-made fifth-generation fighter jets \u2013 planes that feature stealth technologies, radar-jamming capabilities and avionics that integrate onboard and remote data to give pilots a real-time picture of their operation, according to NATO\u2019s Joint Air Power Competence Center. While the DAPA calls the KF-21 a 4.5-generation fighter jet because it lacks such features as an internal weapons bay that would make it more stealthy, analysts say it may be able to fly higher and faster than the newest US-made fifth-generation fighter, the F-35. \u201cThe KF-21 is the first fighter aircraft made with domestic technology, and it indicates that South Korea is now able to build fighter aircraft on its own. It will also be a stepping stone to develop better fighter aircraft and operate locally developed arms,\u201d DAPA said last year. Peter Layton, a fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia, on Wednesday called the KF-21\u2019s flight an \u201cimpressive\u201d milestone. \u201cThe program has significantly enhanced South Korean aerospace capabilities particularly in design, manufacture, airframe components and avionic systems,\u201d said Layton, a former Royal Australian Air Force officer.  The KF-21 is expected to replace South Korea\u2019s F-4 and F-5 fighters, third-generation US-designed jets introduced in the 1960s. As production runs are increased, it could also replace South Korea\u2019s fourth-generation F-16s and F-15Ks,  Abraham Ait, chief editor of Military Watch Magazine, wrote in The Diplomat in 2020. South Korea also operates F-35 stealth fighters. Layton said when operational the KF-21 would improve South Korea\u2019s defensive and offensive capabilities in the air. \u201cGiven the parlous state of the aging North Korean air force fighters, the KF-21 considerably over matches them,\u201d he said. Layton said South Korea\u2019s F-35s have superior stealth capabilities to the KF-21 and are better to penetrate an enemy\u2019s radars. \u201cThe (South Korean) air force will then have a mix of F-35s for strike operations and KF-21s for air defense operations. This concept makes good use of the F-35, which is optimized for attacking ground targets whereas the KF-21 has been optimized for air-to-air missions,\u201d he said. The KF-21 has significant export potential because it is expected to be cheaper than the F-35s the US sells to foreign militaries. Thailand, the Philippines, and possibly even Iraq \u201ccould be leading clients for the fighter,\u201d Ait wrote, adding that each of those countries operates the same kind of aircraft the KF-21 has been designed to replace. Those countries also have been customers for South Korea\u2019s indigenously developed FA-50 light-attack fighter. President Yoon said after Tuesday\u2019s test that \u201ca turning point has been created for the expansion of our defense industry exports.\u201d",

            "text": "Boeing has become so embattled, the company\u2019s stock rose even after reporting a worse-than-expected loss and sales that came in $900 million short of forecasts. For a company that has endured a steady stream of bad news for the last three years these latest results nearly qualify as a \u201cgood\u201d quarter. Shares of Boeing\n            \n                (BA), a component of the Dow, gained 3% in midmorning trading on the report  They\u2019re still down 22% for the year through Tuesday\u2019s close. Investors were likely cheered that Boeing reported positive operating cash flow of $81 million \u2014 only the second quarter in the last three years that the company did not burn through cash. What\u2019s more, the company said it\u2019s on track to maintain positive cash flow for the year.  It could be the beginning of a reversal of a cash-burn trend that Boeing has faced since the second quarter of 2019, when its 737 Max was grounded after two fatal crashes. In that time Boeing has had a negative operating cash flow of $24.7 billion.  However, Boeing was unable to provide a definitive date for resuming deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner planes, which have been halted for more than a year by the Federal Aviation Administration. The company was forced to take a $283 million charge in the quarter related to the costs associated with that halt, and it expects the total costs will reach $2 billion. \u201cWhile we are making meaningful progress, we have more work ahead,\u201d said CEO Dave Calhoun. Overall Boeing reported net income of $160 million excluding special charges for the second quarter, down 72% from a year earlier. And though revenue of $16.9 billion was off just 2% from the prior year, that was $900 million less than analysts had forecast. The adjusted loss came in at of 37 cents a share for the quarter, excluding special items. That\u2019s far worse than the forecast of a 14 cent loss from analysts surveyed by Refinitiv, and the 40 cent a share profit it earned a year ago. Better news on the 737 Max In other sunnier news for Boeing, the company increased production of its 737 Max to 31 planes per month, up from 26 monthly at the end of last year. It also received orders for 169 of the jets during the quarter, including 100 from Delta Air Lines\n            \n                (DAL) \u2014 the only major US airline that had not previously owned the plane. Boeing delivered 103 of the 737 Max jets in the quarter, the most since the FAA ended the 20-month grounding of the jet in in November 2020. One of those deliveries was to Ethiopian Airlines, one of the two airlines that suffered a fatal crash with the plane. Some of Boeing\u2019s customers and major aircraft leasing companies have been scathingly critical of Boeing\u2019s recent performance and calling for a change in management \u2014 most notably Michael O\u2019Leary, CEO of Ryanair, Europe\u2019s largest discount carrier. Earlier this year O\u2019Leary let loose a profanity-filled attack on Boeing during a call with investors, saying its management needed an immediate \u201creboot, or a boot up the a**.\u201d",

            "text": "Alibaba announced a plan to allow more mainland Chinese investors to invest in the stock. In a statement Tuesday, the Chinese tech giant said that its board had approved an application to upgrade its Hong Kong stock to a primary listing, which it expects to take place by the end of this year.  Alibaba\n            \n                (BABA) already has a primary listing in New York, where its shares have traded on the New York Stock Exchange since a massive IPO in 2014. The company will maintain its activity there and hold dual primary listings once the change is complete, it said. The firm has had a secondary listing in Hong Kong since 2019, when it joined the slew of Chinese companies holding what were seen as homecoming parades from Wall Street. News of the latest public offering sent Alibaba\u2019s shares up 5% in Hong Kong and premarket trade in New York on Tuesday. In the company\u2019s statement, Chairman and CEO Daniel Zhang said the decision was made \u201cin the hopes of fostering a wider and more diversified investor base to share in Alibaba\u2019s growth and future, especially from China and other markets in Asia.\u201d  Alibaba has been hit hard since getting caught up in a sweeping crackdown in China on its once booming technology sector. Since then, the company\u2019s shares in New York and Hong Kong have been on a downward slide, losing 49% in value in both markets last year. Its stocks in each city have remained under pressure this year. The upgraded listing should help ease some of the strain, according to Stephen Innes, managing partner of SPI Asset Management. In a report to clients Tuesday, he noted that \u201cthe listing will allow Alibaba to seek inclusion in the Stock Connect links with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges,\u201d referring to a program that allows investors in mainland China and Hong Kong to trade shares across the border. \u201cThis could boost [Alibaba\u2019s] liquidity after a year-long selloff triggered by China\u2019s economic slowdown and Beijing\u2019s crackdown on its most potent internet firms,\u201d Innes wrote. Alibaba has faced more scrutiny since the botched IPO of its fintech affiliate, Ant Group, in 2020, which would have been the world\u2019s largest. The e-commerce titan was also fined a whopping 18.2 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) last year after regulators accused it of acting like a monopoly.  But investors have been hoping that China\u2019s crackdown is coming to an end this year following a historic rout. In April, Chinese state media reported that the government had vowed to promote \u201chealthy development\u201d of the tech sector, sending the country\u2019s tech stocks up.",

            "text": "Air travel is a mess right now and Sen. Elizabeth Warren is demanding that federal regulators do something about it.             In a letter obtained first by CNN, the Massachusetts Democrat, along with California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla, urges Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to use his vast powers to protect consumers by cracking down on the airline industry. The lawmakers want the Transportation Department to \u201caggressively\u201d use its authority to hold airlines accountable for surging prices, mounting cancellations and growing delays.  And they not-so-subtly point out that the recent travel chaos comes barely two years after Uncle Sam bailed out the airline industry during the Covid-19 crisis.  \u201cAfter receiving tens of billions of dollars in assistance from American taxpayers,\u201d Warren and Padilla wrote in the letter sent Monday evening, \u201cmajor airlines have reciprocated by dramatically increasing ticket prices and reaching new lows in their treatment of travelers.\u201d Airlines have blamed a surge of flight cancellations on staff shortages \u2013 including a shortage of pilots \u2013 in the industry. Travel has also been hampered by bad weather, with more than 1,300 flights canceled on Monday alone as East Coast storms disrupted the aviation system, according to FlightAware. Warren and Padilla urged the Transportation Department to hold airlines accountable for canceling flights, \u201cwhether due to their own poor operations and staffing practices or through intentional schemes to offer flights they know they can\u2019t staff in order to later cancel the least-profitable flights.\u201d They note that 41% of flights are delayed for reasons within airlines\u2019 control and called on the agency to issue a rule that imposes fines on airlines for the delays they cause.  \u201cConsistently delaying flights for reasons within an airline\u2019s control is an unfair and deceptive practice,\u201d the joint letter states.  In a statement, a Transportation spokesperson said the department will continue to pressure airlines over consumer protections. \u201cThe Department expects that when Americans buy an airline ticket, they\u2019ll get to where they need to go safely, affordably and reliably,\u201d the spokesperson said. Airlines for America, an industry trade group, cited conditions experienced by the Covid-19 pandemic and said the industry is struggling at a time when travelers are returning to flying \u201cat unexpectedly rapid rates.\u201d The lawmakers took particular issue with intentional rebookings where airlines purposely oversell flights, calling for the Transportation Department to end the practice by forcing airlines to pay a \u201chefty fine\u201d in addition to compensating passengers. \u201cWhen this gamble fails, it should be airlines \u2013 not consumers \u2013 that pay the price,\u201d Warren and Padilla write. The Transportation Department, they note, is empowered to act as a \u201cconsumer protection watchdog,\u201d citing federal law that allows the agency to investigate unfair or deceptive practices and issue fines of up to $37,377 per violation. Beyond penalizing airlines for flight cancellations, Warren and Padilla want regulators to stop the decades-long consolidation of the airline industry. They urge the Transportation Department to \u201cuse its full statutory authority more vigorously\u201d to halt \u201cexcessive consolidation,\u201d which they blame for \u201cconsistent\u201d price hikes on consumers. In the latest example of the shrinking number of airlines in America, low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines is in the center of a bidding war, fielding buyout offers from rivals JetBlue and Frontier Airlines. \u201cDecades of deregulation and consolidation have created an airline industry that routinely heaps inconvenience and abuse on consumers,\u201d the lawmakers write.",

            "title": "This delivery startup was valued at more than $11 billion. Then it slashed thousands of workers",
            "text": "In early March, after two ultra-fast delivery startups shut down in New York City in a single week, a self-proclaimed pioneer in the space appeared to see an opportunity for some media attention.  Getir, a Turkish startup founded in 2015, had recently raised $768 million in funding valuing it at $11.8 billion, \u201ccementing its position as a decacorn\u201d even in the face of a \u201cvolatile\u201d market, according to a representative for the company at the time. The representative suggested a reporter discuss with Getir\u2019s CEO the future of the industry amid the \u201cdisappearance\u201d of two smaller competitors.  Two months later, Getir slashed 14% of its global workforce, or nearly 4,500 employees, according to multiple reports at the time.  The sudden shift reflected the broader turbulence in this sector. Buoyed by billions in venture capital and a surge in demand earlier in the pandemic, a long list of on-demand companies promised to deliver ice cream, toilet paper, vodka or even a single apple in as little as 10 minutes. These startups opened offices and micro-fulfillment centers in cities across the country and rapidly recruited couriers. Then the music stopped. Soaring inflation, rising interest rates, fears of a looming recession and a war in Ukraine forced much of the tech industry to rethink expenses. Perhaps nowhere was that pullback as severe as this flashy, and very costly, corner of the on-demand industry \u2014 an industry which was born out of the Great Recession of 2008 and had never experienced a prolonged downturn. \u201cIt\u2019s the model we saw with Uber a decade ago of heavily prioritizing growth over profits to be able to rapidly seize first-mover advantage,\u201d said Alex Frederick, a senior analyst focused on emerging technology at PitchBook, a data analytics company. This model \u201crequires high burn, high capital investments to continually expand into new markets, attract customers and retain them,\u201d he said. Now, investors may have less appetite for it. This year, Fridge No More and Buyk have shut down operations completely; Jokr said it would shut down its US operations and hone in on its Latin America business; and Gopuff, Gorillas and Getir have each had at least one round of layoffs. Combined, at least 8,250 jobs have been lost, according to a tally by CNN Business based on a combination of press coverage, publicly available information and confirmations from some of the companies. Many of those impacted worked as couriers, or the frontline workers essential to delivering on the missions of speed and convenience.  The fallout has created whiplash for some of the many workers who bet on it. One of the thousands of employees laid off by Getir told CNN Business that they had felt a sense of security because of something they said they\u2019d heard expressed inside the seven-year-old company: It had never undergone layoffs.  The worker, who joined in late 2021 as Getir was building up its US presence in Boston and Chicago, said that while they\u2019d rationally understood it\u2019s common for startups to lay off employees, or even to fail, they believed Getir would be the exception. \u201cI really believed they just didn\u2019t do layoffs and thought they were going to be a very different startup,\u201d said the former employee, who asked their name to be withheld for fear of retaliation. \u201cI believed the dream they were selling. I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d  In an e-mailed response to CNN Business, Getir CEO Nazim Salur said his company \u201cdecided to extend the runway\u201d through layoffs \u201cbecause of the deterioration of market conditions.\u201d Salur added: \u201cLayoffs are something we try not to do unless it is absolutely necessary. This is the first time in Getir\u2019s seven-year history that Getir has gone through a workforce cut of this magnitude.\u201d He declined to provide additional details on the round of cuts in May, including what portion of its US business was impacted. The company said it\u2019s the first instance of widespread layoffs as opposed to specific store closures.  Like Getir, the ultra-fast delivery startups that remain have largely indicated the cuts are intended to help them weather the economic downturn. As they adjust, however, other businesses appear to be eying opportunities to gain a footing in the market, and perhaps change how it operates. The rise and stumbles of 15-minute delivery startups When Gopuff, considered the first to leverage its own stores to fulfill ultra-fast deliveries, was founded in 2013, Uber and the app-based gig economy were only a few years old. Gopuff\u2019s original pitch was to offer hookah deliveries and later food to college students with sudden cravings. Less than a decade later, Gopuff was valued at $15 billion, and then reportedly raised a convertible note at a valuation cap of up to $40 billion. It was also operating in more than 1,200 cities and capturing the attention of a more established gig company, Uber, in the form of a partnership. Gopuff had 450 micro-fulfillment centers spread across college towns and major cities to supply its customers with everything from food to alcohol and medicine almost instantaneously. As of March 2022, it had 15,000 employees.  But in a memo to investors in July, it outlined a number of changes it was making, including a second round of layoffs in a matter of months and closing 76 micro-fulfillment centers, to prepare for the next two years by which time it projects it can be profitable. It said that it is preparing for \u201cwhat could be a much more significant macro-economic downturn than we are experiencing currently.\u201d \u201cThe instant commerce industry that Gopuff created is at an inflection point,\u201d the company said in the memo, a copy of which was viewed by CNN Business. \u201cGopuff was among the last hyper-growth tech companies to raise a significant round in the previous economic environment and among the first to cut costs to focus on and optimize unit economics,\u201d the company said, referring to the revenue and costs associated with each delivery. Even with the cuts at Gopuff and other startups, some industry watchers have doubts about the long-term viability of their main offerings, especially in a more sober economic environment. Brittain Ladd, a supply chain consultant who has advised a number of companies in the space and previously worked in strategy at Amazon, told CNN Business that the premise of 15-minute delivery is a \u201cgimmick.\u201d  \u201cIt hooked people, it generated a lot of publicity, it became something of an oddity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal was to get consumers to ask, \u2018Why is it I can get my groceries in 15 minutes, but I can\u2019t get cosmetics and shoes and apparel and things like that [in 15 minutes]?\u2019\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s where the next phase of growth was going to be,\u201d he added. Then came the downturn and fears of a recession. \u201cInvestors collectively said, \u2018How in the world are we ever going to make money investing in this?\u2019\u201d A slower path forward for some As some of the biggest names in the ultra-fast delivery sector stumble, others are looking to gain ground.  Instacart, which in May filed paperwork to go public, debuted an ultra-fast delivery offering for certain customers of Publix in Miami. Instacart declined to share metrics on the partnership, but a company spokesperson said it has seen interest in the Publix offering, which is called Publix Quick Picks. A Publix spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. In December, DoorDash began offering an ultra-fast delivery option in New York City from a DashMart, one of the stores it opened in 2020, and has since begun expanding. Meanwhile, more under-the-radar companies haven taken what they say are intentionally slower and more methodical approaches to ultra-fast delivery. Paul Stellatos, who has been running grocery stores in the Chicago area for two decades, told CNN Business his company, Go Grocer, had been developing an app to offer quick deliveries from its stores \u2013 without VC-backing. That process took many months, during which time Gorillas and Getir were taking the market by storm. \u201cWe were just kind of sitting back and saying, \u2018Okay, Mr. Gorillas or Mr. Getir, how are you planning on making money capturing the audience and getting a sticky customer, somebody who is gonna order more than once?\u201d said Stellatos, who said that Go Grocer leverages workers from companies like DoorDash and Uber to deliver orders from its stores. \u201cI\u2019m really a stickler on money because we don\u2019t have the opportunity of burning cash. We can only be profitable.\u201d Vitaly Alexandrov, the CEO and founder of San Francisco-based startup Food Rocket, which offers 10- to 30-minute grocery deliveries with an emphasis on fresh food, said it has just six retail locations in San Francisco and Chicago to date.   \u201cIt\u2019s not because we\u2019re a super slow company,\u201d said Alexandrov, who noted Food Rocket grew out of the remnants of his earlier business focused on restaurants that shuttered due to the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s because we tried to build a really sustainable business model. It couldn\u2019t be scalable without such huge losses.\u201d  Alexandrov said the extra time of 30-minute deliveries allows for more \u201csustainable unit economics\u201d because it provides more opportunities to group several deliveries for a single worker. Food Rocket, which has raised $30 million to date, is hoping to raise a new round of funding by the end of the year. \u201cWe still believe that people love to get everything super-fast,\u201d added Alexandrov. One of the most valuable companies in the world apparently thinks so, too. Amazon recently began testing drone deliveries in one town. The goal: fulfilling orders in 30 minutes.",

            "text": "Workers at Boeing\u2019s defense plants in the St. Louis area are threatening to go on strike next week after union members rejected the company\u2019s final contract offer. There are 2,500 members of the International Association of Machinists set to go on strike at 12:01 am central time on August 1. The plants are in St. Louis and St. Charles, Missouri, and Mascoutah, Illinois. \u201cOur members have spoken loudly and with one voice,\u201d said a statement from the union. \u201cThis company continues to make billions of dollars each year off the backs of our hardworking members. Boeing previously took away a pension from our members, and now the company is unwilling to adequately compensate our members\u2019 401(k) plan. We will not allow this company to put our members\u2019 hard-earned retirements in jeopardy.\u201d Boeing issued a statement saying it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the vote to reject what it called a \u201cstrong, highly competitive offer.\u201d The company said the offer matched dollar-for-dollar up to 10% of worker\u2019s base and incentive pay towards 401(k) contributions. Boeing also offered to make a special contribution of 2% of workers\u2019 pay in 2023 and 2024, and to provide matches on student loan payments for workers\u2019 children. \u201cWe are activating our contingency plan to support continuity of operations in the event of a strike,\u201d said the company\u2019s statement. The proposed three-year agreement would have raised average wages by 7.2% in the first year of the contract in addition to giving workers a $1,000 cash bonus, according to a web site about the offer from the company. Workers would have received a 4% increase in the second year and a 3% raise in the third year, according to Boeing.  Boeing has posted deep losses each of the last three years, with net losses totaling $18.1 billion since the start of 2019. But those losses were primarily related to its commercial aircraft business, which has been buffeted by the 20-month grounding of the 737 Max that started in March of 2019 following two fatal crashes, as well as a sharp drop in demand for air travel caused by the pandemic. The company\u2019s defense, space and security business unit posted a $1.5 billion profit each of the last two years. But Boeing reported a loss of $929 million in its defense business in the first quarter this year after a number of special charges, including a $660 million charge related to its refurbishment of two 747 jets to be used as the new Air Force Ones. A strike vote, and even a strike deadline, does not necessarily mean that there will be a work stoppage. But the number of walk outs has been on the rise in the last year, with workers taking a more hardline stance at the bargaining table in the face of high inflation, which is wiping out wage gains being offered by employers. According to data from Cornell University, through the first five months of this year there were 153 US strikes involving about 73,500 workers, up from 78 strikes involving about 22,500 workers in the same period last year. Rank-and-file workers at several companies have gone on strike even after their union leadership reached tentative offers with employers.

            "title": "Boom Supersonic unveils new design for Overture supersonic jet",
            "text": "It\u2019s been almost 20 years since Concorde flew for the final time. While various companies have set about bringing supersonic travel back to life since then, we\u2019re still yet to see this come to fruition. However, Colorado-based start up Boom Supersonic is taking some major leaps forward in its quest to make supersonic flying a reality again. Nearly two years after rolling out ts prototype supersonic demonstrator, the XB1, Boom has unveiled a major new design for its much anticipated Overture airliner, which will fly at twice the speed of today\u2019s subsonic commercial jets and is expected to carry its first passengers in 2029. Renderings of the aircraft, which has been in development for several years, were revealed this week during a press conference at the Farnborough Air Show, a UK-based aviation trade event.  Not only does the updated design feature an extra engine, it also has a contoured fuselage and gull wings.  Refined design According to Kathy Savitt, president and chief business officer at Boom Supersonic, the refined design is the result of around 26 million hours of software simulation, five wind tunnel tests, and 51 design iterations. \u201cWe had to really take the time to learn, to iterate, to walk our walk,\u201d Savitt tells CNN Travel from the Boom Chalet at the Farnborough Air Show.  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like having an actual aircraft to learn from, in addition to the simulators, and the computational hours, which I think has resulted in a remarkable breakthrough, and a remarkable aircraft.\u201d  The aircraft, scheduled go into production in 2024, will fly Mach 1.7 over water with a range of 4,250 nautical miles and have capacity for 65 to 80 passengers, say the team at Boom. In January, United Airlines put in an order for 15 of the supersonic jets, which could potentially fly from New York to London in just three and a half hours.  Meanwhile, Japan Airlines invested $10 million in Boom back in 2017 and has the option to purchase up to 20 aircraft. In addition, the aviation startup recently announced a partnership with US military technology company Northrop Grumman to develop a military variant of Overture.  Net zero carbon aircraft Concerns over noise, along with its environmental impact, played a significant part in the demise of Concorde, and Boom is going to great lengths to ensure that this supersonic jet is both a sustainable and quieter. \u201cOur vision has always been for Overture to be the first clean sheet airplane that was developed and optimized to run on 100% sustainable aviation fuel,\u201d explains Savitt. \u201cAnd today versus during the time of Concorde, we\u2019re able to use carbon composite materials throughout our fuselage, on our wings and on the vertical tail, which allows us to be much more aerodynamic and far more efficient. This helps reduce drag, which takes up fuel, as well as to make the plane far more fuel efficient.\u201d United has already pledged to fly its Overture fleet on 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). According to Savitt, the introduction of a fourth engine on the updated aircraft design will help to reduce noise considerably, while Overture is to utilize the world\u2019s first automated noise reduction system. \u201cWe really focused on how to make our takeoffs and landings as quiet, if not more quiet, than any other long haul airliner leaving from any airport,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been able to achieve. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to fly supersonic over land, we\u2019re going to fly supersonic over water. So that \u2018boom,\u2019 so to speak, is over the high seas. \u201cBut we\u2019re still flying at Mach 0.94 over land, and it was really important for us to be good for the community around airports, by really addressing noise.\u201d Supersonic developments  Efforts to raise the speed of passenger aircraft have been gaining momentum in recent years. NASA has teamed up with aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin to develop the X-59,  a \u201cquiet\u201d experimental supersonic aircraft, in order to collect data that will be shared with US and international regulators to help determine new sound-based rules for supersonic flight over land. Earlier this year, plane manufacturer Bombardier confirmed that its test vehicle, the Global 7500, had broken the sound barrier during a demonstration flight last May, achieving speeds of more than Mach 1.015. Back in 2020, aviation startup Aerion revealed plans for a Mach 4+ commercial airliner named Aerion AS3, but the Florida-based company collapsed the following year. \u201cAviation has not seen a giant leap in decades,\u201d Boom founder and CEO Blake Scholl noted in a statement this month, before declaring that Overture will \u201cfundamentally change how we think about distance.\u201d Boom now has more than 600 different routes across the world planned for Overture. Building connections \u201cWe are really focused on connecting people,\u201d says Savitt. \u201cWe ultimately want Overture to be not only the fastest, but the most sustainable, and the most accessible aircraft for anyone to fly supersonic. \u201cIn a world where you want to speed up that human connection, it shouldn\u2019t be that only few get to do it. \u201c While Scholl has previously said that Boom\u2019s long-term goal is to eventually be able to take passengers anywhere in the world in four hours for $100, it\u2019s safe to assume that we\u2019re unlikely to see seats on sale at that price for a long while. Stressing that \u201cit\u2019s up to the airlines how they price it,\u201d Savitt estimates that an Overture flight will initially cost around 25% more than a Business Class and around 75% less than the Concorde, which was charging around $12,000 for a round trip back in the nineties. Aside from speed, safety and sustainably, described as its \u201cfundamental principles,\u201d the company has put a lot of focus on customer experience. Passengers will have the option to switch from various digital inflight experiences and customize their windows accordingly during their journey.  There will be various flight modes available, including a productivity mode for those who want to focus on work, a relaxation mode for passengers hoping to get some sleep, and an exploration mode for those who want to pay close attention to their route while in the air.  Air travel revolution?  Savitt says that Boom sat down with thousands of potential passengers in order to gain a better understanding of their needs and they\u2019ve found that the desire for sustainable speed has been considerably high. \u201cThey want a new flying experience,\u201d says Savitt. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to spend double the time on a flight, especially post-Covid.\u201d While there\u2019s still a long way to go before we\u2019ll see the aircraft starting passenger services, taxi testing has already begun on the XB1, and the Boom team are \u201cworking on getting her into the air.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re getting very close now,\u201d adds Savitt. So could supersonic really be the future of travel, or is it merely a pipe dream that will never really get off the ground? There\u2019s still no clear answer to that question as such, but the advances made by Boom, as well as the high speed achievements of the Bombardier Global 7500 flight test vehicle and the involvement of NASA, are certainly exciting and hopeful developments. Savitt believes that the Overture has the potential to revolutionize air travel in the same way as Boeing\u2019s 747 jumbo jet, which made its commercial debut in 1970 and became known as the \u201cQueen of the Skies.\u201d \u201cUltimately, we would love to drive a paradigm change, where supersonic becomes really the way that people want to fly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s sustainable. It\u2019s fast. It changes the journey, in that you can spend more time connecting at your destination.  \u201cIn 10 to 15 years, we expect it to be the first choice of traveling, because it\u2019s such a difference maker.\u201d Top image credit: Boom Supersonic",

A unit of Mukesh Ambani\u2019s conglomerate Reliance Industries said on Thursday that it has entered into a \u201clong-term master franchise partnership\u201d with Pret A Manger and will \u201claunch and build the brand in India.\u201d Darshan Mehta, the managing director of Reliance Brands, said in a statement that the partnership was rooted in the \u201cstrong growth potential\u201d of the Pret brand and India\u2019s food and beverage industry.   With its population of 1.3 billion and rapid growth, India is a key market for international food brands, including coffee shops. In 2012, Starbucks \n            \n                (SBUX)opened its first store in the country, by partnering with a unit of India\u2019s largest conglomerate Tata Group. Mehta said that Pret A Manger \u2014 which means \u201cready to eat\u201d in French \u2014 has strong brand recognition in the South Asian country.   Pret A Manger opened in London in 1986 and now has more than 500 shops in the United Kingdom, United States, France, Dubai and Hong Kong. Last September, it announced plans to double the size of the business within five years, including moving into five new markets by the end of 2023.  Reliance Brands said it would \u201copen the food chain across the country starting with major cities and travel hubs,\u201d but a spokesperson declined to share more details. This is not the first time Ambani has struck a deal with a major British brand. In 2019, Reliance bought iconic toy store Hamleys from its Chinese owner C Banner International for around \u00a368 million ($88 million). According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Ambani is currently worth $93 billion, making him the second richest Indian, and the ninth wealthiest person in the world. ",

            "text": "American and United airlines both reported their first operating profit since the start of the pandemic, as strong demand for air travel and high fares allowed the carriers to overcome rising fuel prices. But the good news for airline investors was bad news for airline passengers. The amount passengers paid to fly each mile on the airlines in the quarter was up just over 20% compared to 2019, by far the highest per-mile fares paid since the start of the pandemic. The spike was driven by a combination of less capacity across the industry and strong demand for air travel. Those high fares allowed the airlines to lift revenue above what they booked in the same quarter of 2019, despite the reduced capacity. American posted record second quarter revenue of $13.4 billion, up 12% from 2019 levels, even though capacity was down nearly 9%. Revenue at United was up 6% compared to the same period of 2019, with capacity down 15%. The surging revenue fueled the carriers\u2019 return to profitability. American earned $533 million in the quarter excluding special items, matching the forecasts of analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. That compares to a $1.1 billion loss a year ago, but is well short of the $810 million the airline earned in the same period of 2019, a year ahead of the pandemic. United earned $471 million in the second quarter on that basis, compared to the $1.3 billion it lost in the year-prior period. That profit was less than half what the airline earned in the second quarter of 2019. Unlike American, United fell short of analysts\u2019 forecasts.  Among the reasons that profits couldn\u2019t match the strong revenue was higher costs, especially soaring fuel prices. Fuel is the second largest expense for airlines after labor costs. Both airlines paid more than $4 a gallon for jet fuel in the period, nearly double what they were paying in 2019, and up more than 70% from what each paid at the end of 2021. Although there have been quarters during the pandemic when the airlines reported a positive net income, that was primarily due to financial support they and the rest of the industry received from the federal government during the last two years.  Excluding those payments, American had lost $16.4 billion from the start of 2020 through the first quarter of this year, while United lost $13.6 billion during the same period. Shares of American were slightly lower in premarket trading on the report, while United\n            \n                (UAL) shares fell 6% on its earnings miss.",

            "text": "The CEO of one of America\u2019s largest banks is worried inflation will remain problematic for a while longer \u2014 and he thinks there\u2019s a growing chance of a recession.  Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow Wednesday that people need to \u201cprepare for an environment \u2026 of higher inflation,\u201d adding that \u201cthere\u2019s a good chance that we haven\u2019t quite reached the peak yet.\u201d  What\u2019s more, he said, he believes inflation is \u201cdefinitely not transitory.\u201d With that in mind, Solomon said the odds of a recession are greater than normal \u2014 especially since the Federal Reserve has already raised interest rates three times this year and is expected to do so again following next Wednesday\u2019s meeting.   \u201cAnytime you have high inflation and go through an economic tightening, you wind up having some sort of an economic slowdown,\u201d Solomon said before a Goldman Sachs event for small businesses in Washington, DC. \u201cSo I think the chances that we have a recession are high.\u201d Concerns about an economic slowdown are clearly on the minds of small business owners around the country. \u201cWe\u2019re the backbone of the economy. It all starts with small business,\u201d Jill Bommarito, owner of Ethel\u2019s Baking Company, told Harlow before the Goldman Sachs event at Nationals Park, home of Washington\u2019s baseball team.  Bommarito said her company and other small businesses are all grappling with \u201cinflation pressures, workforce pressures [and] a possible recession.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re all managing risk every day. It\u2019s definitely a possibility. We feel that,\u201d Bommarito said when asked specifically about whether her company, which is based in Shelby Township, Michigan \u2014 a suburb of Detroit \u2014 is preparing for a recession.  Goldman Sachs has concerns about energy independence and immigration policy Recession worries are a major concern for investors, small businesses and Corporate America\u2019s giants. Still, Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) reported better than expected earnings earlier this week, despite a slowdown in deal making and a brutal first half of the year for the stock market.  But Goldman Sachs chief financial officer Denis Coleman had warned during a conference call with analysts that the bank is likely to slow the pace of hiring due to macro concerns. Solomon reiterated to Harlow Wednesday that Goldman Sachs won\u2019t be adding jobs as aggressively in the second half of this year but he noted that hiring is \u201cnot going to zero.\u201d Still, Solomon remained cautious: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what the world\u2019s going to look like in six months. If the world looks more difficult, we\u2019ll adjust accordingly. We always try to be extremely nimble in how we think about these things.\u201d  Solomon also shared advice for the Biden administration about how the federal government can help address some of the nation\u2019s more pressing economic problems, saying politicians need to \u201cthink about long-term policy that supports investment,\u201d particularly in the energy industry and other commodities sectors. \u201cI think we need energy policy that encourages more energy security here and investment in our energy resources,\u201d Solomon said, adding that the US needs to be energy independent and create incentives so that the country can become \u201cmore green\u201d over the long-term. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s coming out of the war in Ukraine is people are going to think differently about energy, about food, about minerals, about certain healthcare resources. From a supply perspective, we have to be secure in some of these things,\u201d Solomon told Harlow. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean everything\u2019s got to be made onshore. We still operate in a global economy, but there are things where we\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019ve got the right access and the right security. And we don\u2019t have to rely necessarily on others.\u201d Solomon also said that the Biden administration should get rid of more \u2014 but not necessarily all \u2014 of the Trump-era tariffs on China. And he said he supports changes to immigration policy to help boost economic growth. \u201cOne of the things I think that would be terrific is temporary work visas. We need more labor in the United States. We have huge job openings,\u201d he said, noting that this would be particularly beneficial for small businesses. Still, he added that \u201cnone of that can happen until we secure the border and there\u2019s a clear border policy.\u201d But Solomon did not seem to think that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that legalized abortion nationwide, will impact Goldman Sachs\u2019 chances of recruiting new workers in states such as Texas where abortions may soon be banned. \u201cOur footprint is all across the United States,\u201d Solomon told Harlow, adding that \u201cmany, many people\u201d have applied for Goldman Sachs jobs in Texas.  That said, Goldman Sachs \u2014 like many other large US companies \u2014 has stressed to current employees that the company will do what it can to support existing workers seeking an abortion who now live in a state where it is or could soon be illegal. \u201cMy first priority after the Supreme Court decision is always just thinking about our employees, their safety, their wellness,\u201d he said.  \u201cSo we did think about our medical support for our employees and we did make changes,\u201d Solomon said, adding that Goldman Sachs will help \u201canyone that needs any medical service of any kind, anywhere in the country\u201d if they are unable to get it in their home state.",

This Airbus A380, the world\u2019s largest passenger jet, has been recruited as a demonstrator to trial new cutting-edge open fan engine architecture which could help cut carbon emissions by up to 20%.  The project was unveiled Tuesday by Airbus and CFM International at Farnborough Air Show just outside of London, an annual trade exhibition showcasing the latest in aerospace innovation.  It\u2019s the latest innovation to be air-tested on the A380 \u201csuperjumbo,\u201d which has had mixed fortunes in recent years. Production of the much-loved airplane was halted in 2021 due to lack of demand. Existing aircraft were grounded by airlines during the pandemic, only to enjoy a recent resurgence due to travel demand. CFM, whose parent companies are GE and Safran Aircraft Engines, has been developing advanced propulsion technologies as part of its Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engine (RISE) demonstration program.  Now the aim is to mature and accelerate that with a flight test campaign on board this A380, which is due to take to the skies in the latter half of this decade from the Airbus Flight Test facility in Toulouse, France.  Before that happens,CFM will perform engine ground tests and flight test validation at GE Aviation\u2019s Flight Test Operations center in Victorville, California.  The aims of the flight test program are to better understand engine/wing integration and aerodynamic performance, to demonstrate better fuel efficiency that would cut CO2 emissions by a fifth compared to today\u2019s most efficient engines, and to ensure compatibility with 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF). The aviation industry has made the ambitious pledge to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and this new technology could help support that.  \u201cNew propulsion technologies will play an important role in achieving aviation\u2019s net-zero objectives, along with new aircraft designs and sustainable energy sources,\u201d said Sabine Klauke, Airbus Chief Technical Officer, in a statement.  The CFM RISE Program is all about pushing the technology envelope, redefining the art of the possible, and helping to achieve more sustainable long-term growth for our industry,\u201d Ga\u00ebl M\u00e9heust, President and CEO of CFM International, confirmed.

            "text": "One of four passengers who joined SpaceX\u2019s first-ever space tourism mission last year and who spent months training on the company\u2019s spacecraft before taking a three-day trek to orbit is now working for Blue Origin, one of SpaceX\u2019s top rivals. Chris Sembroski, an engineer who previously worked at yet another aerospace giant, Lockheed Martin, announced the move on social media this week. At Lockheed, Sembroski\u2019s title was \u201cfault detection and diagnostics lead,\u201d a role in which he worked on maintenance practices for the company\u2019s Rotary and Mission Systems division. He also had a brief stint at DB Engineering, a Redmond, Washington-based mechanical engineering consultancy. Now, he\u2019s taken a role as an avionics engineer at Blue Origin, according to his LinkedIn page. It\u2019s not clear which division of Blue Origin he\u2019ll be working on, though his LinkedIn post included a rendering of the company\u2019s forthcoming rocket New Glenn, which is expected to be powerful enough to reach orbit and is already competing directly with SpaceX\u2019s rockets for lucrative launch contracts.  Blue Origin declined to comment about the specifics of Sembroski\u2019s role.  Blue Origin, which was founded and largely owned by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, is primarily known for developing a suborbital space tourism rocket that took Bezos himself on a supersonic joy ride last year. But the company has also been working for years on New Glenn, and it could make its launch debut within the next year or so.  Sembroski entered the public eye last year, when a friend of his, airline captain Kyle Hippchen, won a lottery to join SpaceX\u2019s Inspiration 4 mission and gifted the ticket to Sembroski. Inspiration 4 marked the first time a crew made up entirely of civilians or otherwise non-professional astronauts staffed a flight to orbit. It was put together by Jared Isaacman, the billionaire CEO of the payment processing company Shift 4. Isaacman billed the mission, which launched in September 2021, as a fundraiser for St. Jude Children\u2019s Hospital, and a fundraiser brought in more than $243 million for the organization. Isaacman reportedly paid \u201cless than $200 million\u201d for the mission. Isaacman and Sembroski flew alongside Hayley Arceneaux, a childhood cancer survivor and St. Jude physician assistant, and Sian Procotor, a PhD geologist and college professor. The Inspiration 4 crew spent three days in space before making a splashdown landing off the coast of Florida.  Blue Origin is not currently working on a capsule that could compete directly with SpaceX in the orbital space tourism game, but the New Glenn rocket could prove to be a workhorse for Blue Origin and aid Bezos\u2019 ultimate goal of establishing orbiting colonies in Earth\u2019s orbit.",

            "text": "Boeing\u2019s delivery of two new Air Force One planes has been delayed again, the Air Force announced Tuesday, with the completion of the first of the new presidential planes not expected for at least another four years.   \u201cThe new objective delivery date to the Presidential Airlift Group for the first aircraft is September 2026 and the second aircraft is February 2027, a 24-month delay from the original contractual dates; and the new threshold dates are September 2027 for the first aircraft and February 2028 for the second, a 36-month delay,\u201d the Air Force said in a statement.  Boeing struck the deal to make the two new planes in 2018 with then-President Donald Trump. At the time, Trump asked for the planes to be ready by 2021, but the project has faced a series of delays.  The military said in its statement Tuesday that the delayed delivery was due to a number of factors, including \u201cimpacts from the Covid-19 pandemic, interiors supplier transition, manpower limitations, wiring design timelines, and projected test execution rates.\u201d  The Air Force also said that until the new planes are delivered, it \u201cremains postured to keep\u201d the current two presidential planes \u201cavailable and mission-ready.\u201d  After running into a host of issues while building the planes, the deal proved to be a regrettable one for the airline builder, with Boeing CEO David Calhoun saying earlier this year that the $3.9 billion contract that Boeing signed to build the planes was a mistake for the company, given the losses it is now incurring. He said the 2018 deal with the Air Force included \u201ca very unique set of risks that Boeing probably shouldn\u2019t have taken.\u201d The former President, with his deal-making persona, took an unusually hands-on approach to the Air Force One deal. He personally met with Boeing big-wigs at the White House to seal the deal. He also shared drawings for a new red, white and blue color scheme for the jets.  The Biden administration, however, said last month that Trump\u2019s proposed paint scheme was no longer under consideration due to cost and engineering concerns. ",

            "title": "Opinion: The pilot shortage is about to get a lot worse",
            "text": "The ongoing pilot shortage has already wreaked havoc on summer vacation travel in the United States \u2014 and it\u2019s only the beginning. With too few pilots to meet demand, the industry is likely to be in store for even higher airfares, more reductions in schedules and routes, and a contraction of the nation\u2019s regional airline network. And these disruptions could persist for a decade. Based on data from Oliver Wyman\u2019s fleet forecast and our models for industry growth, we anticipate a shortage of almost 30,000 pilots in North America by 2032 if the industry fails to address its staffing problems. That\u2019s almost four times higher than this year\u2019s anticipated gap of 8,000 pilots, which has already proven to be problematic, even with demand still below where it was before the Covid-19 pandemic. Behind the pilot shortage is a confluence of trends, including the retirement of aging Baby Boomers and significantly fewer job candidates coming from the military, as the use of unmanned drones steadily increased and there were fewer deployments. Covid-19 exacerbated the shortfall, with airlines offering pilots early retirement at the height of the pandemic. When travel demand surged in 2021, the pilot shortfall was so dramatic that it hampered the airlines\u2019 ability to ramp back up, leading to flight delays and cancellations. Besides inconvenience, passengers are already paying for the shortage with higher airfares and more tightly packed aircraft \u2014 and will continue to do so in the months and years ahead \u2014 as airlines consolidate traffic into as few flights as possible. While this reduces the demand for pilots, it also limits the supply of seats available, making each one more valuable, but also more expensive to fly and buy. During busier travel periods, a lower capacity makes it more difficult to rebook passengers when flights are canceled and jeopardizes service to less popular and more remote destinations all year long.  Wages and the regional disadvantage The expanding gap between supply and demand is forcing airlines to compete with one another for pilots through higher compensation. Recent contract negotiations are pushing up pilot salaries, which will challenge the airlines\u2019 profit margins and may not even be enough to address the shortfall, especially in the near term.  The 2021 median annual pay for airline pilots, co-pilots and flight engineers was $202,180, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, and has been steadily increasing.  The race to stay competitive on pilot pay is leaving smaller regional airlines at a distinct disadvantage because they can\u2019t afford to compete. This will be especially true for those airlines not wholly owned by or affiliated with large airlines. Already, regionals are losing pilots to bigger carriers where the compensation is materially higher and there\u2019s more potential for long-term career advancement. We expect the economic impact to be severe enough to prompt consolidations and even failures among US regional carriers \u2014 a further threat to service to smaller cities and sparsely traveled routes.  The pilot shortfall and rising labor costs also could affect the standing of various low-cost carriers. On one hand, higher operating costs may undercut their ability to maintain lower fares than their global rivals, and the shortage is likely to prevent them from adding flights when demand is high. On the other, the disruption to the regional model may create growth opportunities. We expect the more successful low-cost carriers to cherry-pick the most profitable smaller city routes that might otherwise see reduced service. Success hinges on how effectively low-cost carriers can manage their relative pilot cost advantage, while still retaining pilots for growth.  No quick fix Working our way out of the pilot shortage will not be as easy. First, it takes time to become a pilot. While the pay is potentially lucrative, training to become a commercial airline pilot in the US typically involves 1,500 hours of flight time and can cost almost $100,000, limiting the number of candidates.  The industry is also working with an artificially small pool of potential candidates, given the tiny portion of pilots who are either female or people of color. For instance, only 8% of all US commercial airline pilots are women, according to the Pilot Institute, a flight training school. The industry could try to convince the Federal Aviation Administration to raise the retirement age, which is currently 65. But this would have limited impact because of the number of pilots affected by the change, and the fact that many might still opt to retire. A more powerful regulatory modification would be to reduce the number of flight hours required to be certified, although we think a wholesale change to this requirement is unlikely. Another significant longer-term fix might include the government and industry creating more programs that build awareness around the benefits of pursuing a career as a pilot, especially for middle school and high school students. Airlines could also increase their current efforts to sponsor pilot candidates, providing more of them with financial support and positioning them for a commercial airline job. Government grants could also ease the cost burden on pilot candidates, as well as help pay for building more training capacity. Already today, there is an acute shortage of both simulators and instructors to train the next generation of pilots and keep the current ones certified. That said, these potential solutions would probably take years to make a significant difference.  Until we get enough pilots trained and hired, airlines and passengers will feel the pinch of higher costs and flight delays and cancellations. ",

Reuters reported in March that Delta was edging toward an order for 100 MAX 10 planes and reported last week that Airbus was in talks for Delta to expand an existing order of A220 planes. Delta, which made the announcement at the Farnborough Airshow, said it would start taking MAX 10 deliveries in 2025. Delta previously was the only major US airline without a MAX in its fleet or on order. The MAX was grounded for 20 months after two fatal crashes killed 346 people. The grounding was lifted in November 2020 after software and training updates.  \u201cThis is a huge testament to the value of the MAX,\u201d said Boeing senior vice president of commercial sales and marketing Ihssane Mounir at a signing event. \u201cWhat an endorsement from a world-class airline.\u201d Boeing has had \u201cstrong demand\u201d for the MAX since the ungrounding, with over 1,000 gross orders and 1.7 million flight hours, Boeing\u2019s Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal said. With the new order, Delta\u2019s Boeing 737 fleet will expand to more than 300 total aircraft and will be its second-largest fleet family behind the Airbus A320. Reuters separately reported a top-up order from Delta for around a dozen Airbus A220s is set to be signed as soon as Tuesday at the air show. Boeing faces a December deadline to win approval for the 737 MAX 10 - the largest member of its best-selling single-aisle airplane family. Otherwise, it must meet new cockpit alerting requirements under a 2020 law, unless Congress waives it. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told Aviation Week in an interview published this month that the planemaker could be forced to cancel the 737 MAX 10 over potential regulatory issues. On Sunday, Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal said that canceling the MAX 10 was \u201cnot a high probability path.\u201d Delta said in the event of a delay in certification \u201cthe agreement has adequate protection in place, including allowing Delta to shift to another model of the MAX family if necessary.\u201d Delta had extensive discussions with Boeing before it agreed to the deal. \u201cIt took us a long time getting here,\u201d Delta senior vice president Mahendra Nair said, saying it had options if the MAX 10 does not move forward. \u201cThis is really the airplane that we would want and we would hope that Boeing can get the extension that they need for the certification.\u201d The MAX 10 aircraft will be 20%-30% more fuel efficient than the retiring Delta planes it will replace.",

            "text": "Goldman Sachs is clearly still the top dog on Wall Street. The investment banking powerhouse reported earnings and revenue Monday morning for the second quarter that easily topped analysts\u2019 forecasts.  Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) posted a profit of $2.9 billion, or $7.73 a share, during the three months ending in June. Analysts were expecting earnings of $6.61 a share. The bank also generated revenue of $11.9 billion. While that was down 23% from a year ago, it still surpassed consensus estimates of $10.7 billion. Shares of Goldman Sachs, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow, rose 2% in late afternoon trading Monday. The results were not enough to support the broader market though. The Dow and other financial stocks were flat to down slightly. Goldman Sachs thrived despite the fact that stocks plummeted during the first half of 2022. The environment for banks was particularly challenging.  Rivals JPMorgan Chase\n            \n                (JPM) and Morgan Stanley\n            \n                (MS) both reported earnings last week that missed forecasts. Bank of America\n            \n                (BAC) posted earnings and revenue that also failed to meet expectations on Monday. The investment banking side of their businesses were largely responsible for the disappointing results. But Goldman Sachs was helped by a boost in its massive bond trading unit. Revenue for fixed income trading surged as yields rose thanks to interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.  Goldman Sachs also said that its consumer and wealth management unit, which includes the digital bank Marcus, posted record revenue of nearly $2.2 billion in the quarter, up 25% from the same period last year. \u201cDespite increased volatility and uncertainty, I remain confident in our ability to navigate the environment,\u201d said Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon in the bank\u2019s press release. Consumer businesses are strong despite recession fears The consumer divisions of the biggest banks continue to perform well, despite all the worries about inflation and a possible recession. Solomon noted during a conference call with analysts that \u201cwe don\u2019t see significant indications of credit deterioration\u201d in its consumer business, even though \u201cit\u2019s certainly an environment where people are more cautious about risk.\u201d Bank of America also reported healthy results from its consumer unit. BofA CEO Brian Moynihan told analysts during a conference call Monday that the bank is \u201cmindful of the debate about a future recession, and we have prepared the company across the last decade-plus through responsible growth to be prepared for that.\u201d \u201cBut as we see our current customer base, we are not seeing them slow down in terms of their activities,\u201d Moynihan added. Banks are also in much healthier financial shape now than they were during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and Great Recession. Top US financial firms all passed the Fed\u2019s most recent stress tests, which measure how well banks will be able to weather any future economic and market adversity.  Many big banks raised their dividends following the stress test results. Goldman Sachs boosted its quarterly payout by 25%.  Despite that, shares of Goldman Sachs are still down more than 20% this year. And the broader market\u2019s struggles has been bad news for Goldman Sachs employees. The bank said Monday that its compensation and benefits expenses, the so-called bonus pool, was down more than 30% from a year ago. Goldman\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Denis Coleman also said on the conference call with analysts that the bank is planning to slow the pace of new hires due to the \u201cchallenging operating environment.\u201d",

            "text": "One share of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet is suddenly a lot more affordable for Main Street investors \u2014 following a massive stock split that took effect Monday. Alphabet\n            \n                (GOOGL) split its two classes of shares\n            \n                (GOOG) by a 20-to-1 margin, a move that reduced the price of one share from just over $2,200 on Friday to about $110 on Monday. The stock split doesn\u2019t change Alphabet\u2019s market capitalization. The company is still worth nearly $1.5 trillion, making it one of the most valuable firms on the planet.  But the split has two potential benefits. First, it may make Alphabet shares more enticing for everyday investors. Second, it increases the odds that Alphabet could eventually be added to the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average. That\u2019s because the Dow, which lists only 30 stocks, is weighted by price \u2014 in contrast to the S&P 500 and many other indexes that weight by market value. So if the Dow were to include a stock with a super high price, that would heavily skew the index\u2019s daily performance.  Insurer UnitedHealth\n            \n                (UNH), which trades at more than $525 a share, currently has the highest weighting in the Dow, making up about 11% of the average. Meanwhile Apple\n            \n                (AAPL) is the 13th biggest Dow component, despite the fact that it has a market value of $2.4 trillion, nearly five times that of UnitedHealth\n            \n                (UNH). Apple was added to the Dow in 2015, but only after a stock split in 2014 reduced its share price.  The list of Dow components is the subject of some discussion. Even though Dow includes Apple, Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT) and business software giants Salesforce\n            \n                (CRM) and IBM\n            \n                (IBM), some critics think the century-old market barometer still needs a further revamp for the 21st century. That could mean adding Alphabet as well as Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN), another market behemoth that recently split its stock 20 to 1. Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN) now trades at about $115 a share, down from pre-split levels above $2,000. But the company is still worth about $1.2 trillion, nearly double the combined market valuations of retail giants Walmart\n            \n                (WMT) and Home Depot\n            \n                (HD), both of which are in the Dow.  Several other high-profile companies have also recently announced intentions to split their stocks, including Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) and meme favorite GameStop\n            \n                (GME). That could lead to more interest from average investors, especially those who look for momentum plays on social media sites like Reddit. ",

            "text": "Delta Air Lines took what it called a \u201ccreative\u201d step to solve a massive baggage problem for passengers flying through troubled Heathrow Airport. Others might call the move extreme: the airline flew a plane from London to its hub in Detroit packed with 1,000 lost bags and zero passengers. A staffing shortage that has caused a service meltdown at Heathrow in recent weeks has now been dubbed \u201cairmageddon.\u201d Airport authorities have responded to the canceled flights and massive lost baggage complaints by telling airlines they must cap the number of passengers at one of the world\u2019s busiest airports to 100,000 a day. So Delta figured out a way to get the lost bags out of the airport, even though it couldn\u2019t take more passengers. \u201cDelta teams worked a creative solution to move delayed checked bags from London-Heathrow on July 11 after a regularly scheduled flight had to be canceled given airport passenger volume restrictions at Heathrow,\u201d said a statement from the airline. \u201cDelta flight 9888 from Heathrow to Delta\u2019s Detroit hub flew 1,000 bags back to the United States, where teams then forwarded the bags on to our customers.\u201d The passenger-free flight was first reported by the New York Times. Delta and other US airlines have been hit with their own staffing shortages and service problems so far this summer travel season, causing nearly 30,000 flights to, from or within the United States to be canceled, according to tracking service FlightAware. The disruptions have been particularly bad over holiday weekends such as Memorial Day, the Father\u2019s Day/Juneteenth weekend and the July 4th holiday. Delta\n            \n                (DAL) reported earnings Wednesday that were sharply lower than forecast due in part to higher fuel costs but also greatly attributed to the cost of dealing with those service problems.  Although Delta did not break out the specific costs of the service issues, it did say it will pay an extra $200 million this year in overtime and premium pay to reduce the number of flight cancellations. And that doesn\u2019t count other costs associated with service disruptions \u2014 such as flying jets full of bags overseas without any paying customers. \u201cI want to thank our customers for their patience and understanding as we restore the reliability that you\u2019ve come to expect from Delta,\u201d Delta CEO Ed Bastian said during a call with investors Wednesday.

            "text": "Emirates airline has blasted one of the world\u2019s busiest airports for its \u201cincompetence\u201d in failing to handle a surge in passengers.  The Dubai-based airline on Thursday slammed demands made by London\u2019s Heathrow airport earlier this week that carriers stop selling any more tickets for this summer.  The airline, which operates six daily flights from Heathrow, has rejected the new limits and called them \u201centirely unreasonable and unacceptable.\u201d Heathrow, like other airports, has struggled to cope with a bounce back in travelers after two years of pandemic restrictions and staff cuts. The airport said on Tuesday that it would cap daily departing passenger numbers at 100,000 until September 11.  \u201c[London Heathrow] chose not to act, not to plan, not to invest. Now faced with an \u2018airmageddon\u2019 situation due to their incompetence and non-action, they are pushing the entire burden \u2014 of costs and the scramble to sort the mess \u2014 to airlines and travelers,\u201d the airline said in a statement.  The company said that Heathrow had given it only 36 hours to comply with the new cap, and had threatened legal action against airlines that refuse to comply. It added that it had enough ground handling and catering staff to handle its flights at the airport.  Emirates said that Heathrow\u2019s management team were \u201ccavalier about travelers and their airline customers,\u201d and had failed to rehire and train enough staff in advance of the predictable surge in summer travel. On average, Heathrow handled nearly 220,000 passengers each day, split between arrivals and departure, in 2018. A spokesperson for Heathrow told CNN Business that a major cause of delayed flights and cancellations was a lack of airline ground handling teams, which it said are only staffed at 70% of pre-pandemic levels. \u201cFor months we have asked airlines to help come up with a plan to solve their resourcing challenges, but no clear plans were forthcoming and with each passing day the problem got worse,\u201d the spokesperson said.  Heathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said in an open letter to passengers on Tuesday that airlines had sold too many seats for the coming months. \u201cDaily departing seats over the summer will average 104,000 \u2014 giving a daily excess of 4,000 seats. On average only about 1,500 of these 4,000 daily seats have currently been sold to passengers,\u201d he said in the letter.  Blame game Emirates said that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to rebook all potentially impacted passengers onto new flights over the next few weeks.  It said that the 100,000 daily cap on the number of departing passengers was a figure that \u201cappear[ed] to [have been] plucked from thin air,\u201d and it would continue to operate its flights as planned.  It\u2019s not just Emirates that is angry.  Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and former CEO of British Airways owner IAG, said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday that the travel restrictions were \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cAirlines have been predicting stronger traffic than Heathrow has been predicting \u2026 they clearly got it completely wrong,\u201d he said.  Walsh also accused Heathrow of trying to \u201cmaximize the profitability that they get from the airport at the expense of airlines.\u201d Heathrow rejected Walsh\u2019s comments.  \u201cWhat we need is collaborative working and investment in services to protect passengers, not ill-informed comments from retired airline bosses,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN Business on Wednesday.  \u2014 Sharon Browne-Peter contributed reporting.",

            "text": "It\u2019s been an unusual couple of years for the aviation industry. After months of pandemic-related groundings, travel\u2019s returned not with a bang, but with a bit of a whimper, as many global airlines and airports struggle with cancellations and delays. In the midst of this chaotic season of travel, Australia-based aviation safety and product rating agency AirlineRatings.com has released its annual round-up of the world\u2019s best airlines.  Nabbing the top spot for the second year in the row is Qatar Airways, with AirlineRatings.com stating this carrier\u2019s commitment to flying over the past couple years was the deciding factor. Qatar Airways also won the Excellence in Long Haul - Middle East/Africa award. \u201cQatar Airways\u2019 decision to remain operating through the pandemic meant that it became the world\u2019s largest international airline and posted a huge profit \u2013 the only major airline to do so,\u201d Geoffrey Thomas, editor-in-chief of AirlineRatings.com told CNN Travel. Ranking traveler options  As well as profitability, AirlineRatings.com says its team of editors also assessed each airline\u2019s fleet age, environmental and safety credentials, passenger reviews and product offerings. Hot on the heels of Qatar Airways is Air New Zealand, an airline that\u2019s topped AirlineRatings\u2019 list six times in recent years, and last year also came in at number two. For 2022, Air New Zealand was also recognized by AirlineRatings.com as the carrier with the best premium economy and economy options, and the best option for long haul travel in the Pacific region. Number three on AirlineRatings.com\u2019s list is Etihad Airways. The UAE-based airline was also awarded the accolade for Environmental Airline of the Year, due to what Thomas said was a \u201cbenchmark\u201d commitment to cutting emissions.  The number four airline is Korean Air, which also won the Cargo Airline of the Year and Excellence in Long Haul - Asia awards, while Singapore Airlines, winner of Best First Class and Best Lounges, rounds out the top five. AirlineRatings.com also highlights the top budget airlines for 2022, although these low-cost carriers aren\u2019t ranked. Instead, they are listed alphabetically: Allegiant Air, AirAsia, easyjet, Jetstar, Flair, Fly Dubai, Ryanair, Scoot, Southwest and VietJet Air.  Thomas told CNN Travel the results reflect the continued impact of Covid-19 on aviation, but the recent spike in delays and cancellations did not affect the rankings. \u201cThe current crisis in travel didn\u2019t play a role as it\u2019s a unique event,\u201d said Thomas, who suggested current events are also \u201clargely not of the airlines\u2019 making.\u201d Experts have suggested current problems are related to staff shortage, airport issues, labor relations and weather. Overall, Thomas sees the rankings as a positive take on the travel industry today. \u201cThe results highlight the very high standard of offering for travelers,\u201d he said.

            "text": "Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo on Wednesday had a blunt message about stalled legislation that would address a critical shortage in semiconductor chips. \u201cThe message is, time\u2019s up,\u201d Raimondo said in an interview with CNN a few hours before traveling to Capitol Hill with top defense and intelligence officials to meet with lawmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s time to make it happen.\u201d  It\u2019s a message that comes as a sweeping proposal that includes $52 billion to turbocharge US semiconductor development and manufacturing is caught in the middle of partisan warfare, threatening its prospects. The Biden administration officials made an urgent appeal to senators at Wednesday\u2019s classified briefing, calling on Congress to act before the August recess and warning of grave consequences if the legislation continues to languish. \u201cThe message is that the chips part is the most important and the biggest vulnerability but there are other aspects of the bill that are important too,\u201d GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said after the briefing. \u201cThis is about the art of the possible and we need to figure it out.\u201d Democratic leaders are weighing the best path forward, which Raimondo said may mean breaking the chips funding off from the broader legislation and passing it as a standalone measure.  While the Cabinet official made clear to CNN she wasn\u2019t going to tell Democratic leaders the best path forward, she did note she\u2019d had a series of calls with lawmakers in both parties in the last few days.  \u201cIt seems like folks are coalescing around the plan of some kind of a chips-plus package and moving quickly,\u201d Raimondo said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s what I\u2019m hopeful will happen.\u201d Raimondo, who was joined by Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, has pressed lawmakers to move on the issue since the early days of the administration.  That effort has reached a critical stage, according to Raimondo, as industry players have communicated to top administration officials that their investment plans need to be solidified in the coming months.  \u201cSemiconductor companies need to get \u2018concrete in the ground\u2019 by this fall to meet this increased demand in the years ahead,\u201d Raimondo and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin wrote in a Wednesday letter to congressional leaders. \u201cCEOs of firms all along the supply chain have made clear that the industry is deciding where to invest now.\u201d  Administration officials view the stakes as significant and wide ranging. Or, as Raimondo candidly put it: \u201cEveryone who has studied enough has an \u2018oh sh*t\u2019 moment.\u201d  Several companies have tied significant US manufacturing investments to the passage of chip funding, including Intel, which held a high-profile event at the White House in January to announce a $20 billion facility in Ohio.  The company recently canceled a scheduled July groundbreaking on account of congressional inaction.  As inflation sits at a new 40-year high, the ability to dramatically expand the supply of critical components in everything from cars and washing machines to iPhones is seen inside the administration as a long-term necessity.  \u201cClearly inflation is a problem,\u201d Raimondo said. \u201cAnd so investing to increase supply of chips is going to have a positive long term effect on inflation.\u201d The briefing on Wednesday, requested by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, also drew direct attention to what officials view as the national security necessity of the funding. \u201cIt\u2019s in the interest of every American \u2013 so we can sleep easy at night knowing our national security is protected and China won\u2019t eat our lunch \u2013 to pass this bill, particularly the chips component, because that\u2019s the most time sensitive,\u201d Raimondo said after the briefing.  Based on the questions senators were asking, she added, the bill is clearly seen as a \u201cnational security imperative.\u201d It\u2019s something with both near-term and longer-term implications. Raimondo noted that defense contractors are rapidly moving to replenish supply due to the massive US effort to supply weapons systems to Ukraine \u2013 many of which rely on chips.  But more broadly, officials keenly aware of significant Chinese efforts to ramp up domestic manufacturing of chips are seeing future defense systems as being at risk.  \u201cWeapons systems employed on the battlefields of today and emerging technologies of tomorrow depend on our access to a steady, secure supply of microelectronics,\u201d Raimondo and Austin wrote in their letter. \u201cImmediate passage will revitalize the domestic semiconductor manufacturing industry and enable game-changing capabilities our warfighters need.\u201d  Still, despite the bipartisan Senate passage last year of a sweeping bill that included the chips funding, and bipartisan agreement on the problem itself, the prospects for a bill to reach President Joe Biden\u2019s desk have run into a wall.  More than a year after the Senate passed its bill, known as USICA, there are still a myriad of outstanding issues that haven\u2019t been reconciled with the House Democratic counterpart. Aides in both parties acknowledge a near-term resolution is all but impossible at this point.  Things grew more dire in recent weeks when Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who voted for the Senate proposal, drew his own red-line tied to the separate Democratic effort to pass a party-line economic package.  \u201cLet me be perfectly clear: there will be no bipartisan USICA as long as Democrats are pursuing a partisan reconciliation bill,\u201d McConnell said in a June 30 tweet.  McConnell would not comment on Wednesday when CNN asked if the briefing had changed his mind about threatening to kill the legislation if Democrats move ahead with reconciliation. Democrats, some of whom candidly acknowledged to CNN they saw a political opportunity, have railed against the proposed obstruction on from both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue.  But McConnell appeared to lay out a potential pathway to a resolution this week, when he noted two potential options would be for the House to simply pass the Senate version of the legislation or breaking the chips funding off and move it separately.  \u201cThere are members I have who are not overly fond of USICA but do think there\u2019s a national security aspect to the chips deficit,\u201d McConnell told reporters on Tuesday.  Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, ruled out the idea of passing the Senate version of the bill on Wednesday.  Raimondo directly cited that sequence of events when asked about the administration\u2019s view of spinning off the chips funding and moving it immediately.  \u201cI am simply saying time\u2019s up for the chips portion of it,\u201d Raimondo said.  As to political back and forth that has clouded the potential end game, Raimondo said she wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cPolitical posturing, looking for leverage in the 11th hour, trying to get exactly what you want in a bill,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s all pretty much standard operating procedure.\u201d But with lawmakers scheduled to depart Washington for the August recess in the coming weeks, that sanguine view won\u2019t hold much longer.  \u201cGoing away for recess without getting this done, knowing that it puts your country at a massive you know, security risk,\u201d Raimondo said. \u201cThen I would be surprised. And really disappointed.\u201d  This story has been updated with additional developments.",

            "text": "Ethiopian Airlines took delivery of a 737 Max from Boeing in June, the aircraft maker disclosed Tuesday.  It\u2019s the first time Ethiopian has taken a 737 Max since the March 2019 crash that killed all 157 people on board, and led to a 20-month grounding of the jet.  The other airline that suffered a fatal crash involving the Max, Lion Air of Indonesia, has yet to take a new Max delivery.  Boeing reported the delivery as part of its June orders and delivery report. Overall it was also the busiest month for 737 Max deliveries since the grounding ended in late 2020, with 43 of the planes being delivered to customers. It was also the busiest month for any kind of commercial plane deliveries by Boeing since March of 2019, with a total of 51 deliveries. It\u2019s a sign that demand for the plane is returning to pre-crash levels. Boeing has so far delivered 443 of the 737 Max jets since the grounding ended, with 181 of those being delivered so far this year, up from 105 delivered in the first half of 2021. Ethiopian did not respond to a request for comment on taking the delivery. Its web site lists four 737 Max planes in its fleet, and another 24 on order. It\u2019s not clear how the June delivery affects those numbers. The airline also has 27 older versions of the 737 Max in its fleet. The purchase was criticized by Robert Clifford, an attorney for families of the crash victims. \u201cThis is really disappointing \u2013 a sad reminder for the crash victims families nearly three and a half years later, knowing that the Boeing Max will be flying again even in Ethiopia, where the crash happened,\u201d he said. Boeing has faced myriad problems in recent years, beyond the drop in demand for passenger planes that occurred during the pandemic. It is still waiting approval to again begin delivering the 787 widebody passenger planes that have been halted due to quality control issues.  Deliveries are crucial to Boeing\u2019s bottom line since it gets most of the money from airline sales at the time of delivery. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv forecast another narrow loss for Boeing when it reports second quarter results later this month. ",

Shares of BYD in the United States tumbled 11% Tuesday after Hong Kong\u2019s Central Clearing and Settlement System recorded a massive 225-million-share increase in Citibank\u2019s BYD stock holdings, Reuters reported. That\u2019s the exact number of BYD shares that Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway had owned. Berkshire did not respond to a request for comment, and it may not be known whether Buffett sold the stake until the company\u2019s next quarterly regulatory disclosure, set for mid-August. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKA) rose less than 1% Tuesday. But investors weren\u2019t waiting to sell what they believed was bad news for BYD. Berkshire\u2019s enormous holding in the company represented 20.5% of the company\u2019s outstanding shares. BYD is in a close second place in Chinese EV sales and is nipping at Tesla\u2019s heels. BYD sold 69,544 electric vehicles in China last month, compared to 78,000 from Tesla.  China\u2019s overall car market slowed in the spring and the country\u2019s sweeping lockdowns kept factory workers at home and potential buyers at bay. Still, BYD continued to dominate. The company sold a record 106,000 new energy vehicles in April, more than half of which were fully electric. The company\u2019s sales rose 300% between April 2021 and April 2022. Analysts have attributed BYD\u2019s resilience in sales to its \u201cvertical integrated supply chain.\u201d The business model has made BYD less vulnerable to supply chain disruptions during the lockdowns, while rivals had to cut back production because of chip and battery shortages. China\u2019s market has begun to ramp up again in recent months. Even if its competitors gain momentum, BYD stands to benefit: The company reportedly has a deal in place to supply Tesla with battery technology soon. BYD has been making its lithium iron phosphate \u201cBlade Batteries\u201d since 2020, for use in its own cars and for sale to other auto makers.",

            "text": "The post-pandemic recovery of commercial aviation may have an early, unlikely protagonist: the A380 superjumbo. The world\u2019s largest passenger plane seemed to be on the scrapheap just two years ago, as airlines grappled with the spread of the coronavirus. The entire fleet was grounded, many of the planes went into long-term storage, and some airlines even took the chance to get rid of their A380s altogether, with Air France retiring its fleet in May 2020. But now, as passenger numbers rise and air traffic returns to pre-pandemic levels, the plane is enjoying a resurgence. More than half the global fleet is already back into service, according to data from Flightradar24.  Lufthansa was the latest carrier to announce the plane\u2019s return \u2013 although not before 2023 \u2013 and there are reasons to believe that more A380s will progressively soar back into the skies. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely having a comeback,\u201d says Geoff Van Klaveren, an aviation analyst and managing director of advisory at IBA. \u201cOperators were quite reluctant to bring it back because it\u2019s a very costly airplane, but I think we\u2019ve seen demand recovering faster than people expected.\u201d More coming back Airbus produced and delivered 251 A380s, and 238 remain available for service today, with the rest having been retired or scrapped. The plane, which is no longer in production, is popular with passengers and crews but not with airlines \u2013 only 14 have operated it to date.  Out of those, nine are currently flying it: British Airways, All Nippon Airways, Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Qantas, Qatar, Asiana, Korean Air and China Southern Airlines. Some of these already have plans to press even more of their A380s back into service.  Singapore Airlines, for example, is currently flying 10 A380s out of its fleet of 12, but confirmed to CNN Travel that the remaining two are currently being retrofitted and will re-enter the fleet soon. Korean Air also said that it will bring back a third A380 out of its fleet of 10, to join the two already in service. Qantas, which is operating three out of its 12 A380s on the Sydney-Singapore-London route, confirmed to CNN Travel that it aims to have a total of six back into service before the end of the year, with a plan to reinstate four more by 2024 (the remaining two are to be scrapped).  Emirates, the largest A380 operator with 123 of the aircraft, is also ramping up. \u201cToday we operate [\u2026] more than half of our A380s,\u201d says Richard Jewsbury, divisional vice president UK at Emirates. \u201cBy the end of the year, we\u2019re aiming to operate close to 90 A380s across our entire network.\u201d That means that over a dozen more A380s will join the ones currently flying.  The very last A380 ever produced, in late 2021, went to Emirates. It\u2019s among a handful of Emirates A380s to include a premium economy section \u2013 a middle ground between basic economy and business class.  It has proven popular enough that the airline plans to retrofit 67 more of its A380s with it, over the course of 18 months and starting later this year. In that configuration, with four classes including first, business, premium economy and economy, the aircraft can seat 484 passengers. In the densest, two-class configuration with business and economy only, Emirates A380s have capacity for 615 passengers. Tough sell There are several reasons why airlines are circling back to the superjumbo. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of wide-body capacity, as some operators such as British Airways retired older airplanes like the Boeing 747. There have also been some production issues with the new A350 and so forth. So some airlines need the capacity,\u201d says Van Klaveren. That\u2019s not all. For some airlines, putting the plane back into service makes sense because the value of the aircraft has fallen so much that it\u2019s no longer possible to sell them.  \u201cSome operators have realized that it\u2019s a very difficult airplane to sell, for many different reasons. If you don\u2019t have any A380s you\u2019re definitely not going to bring it into your fleet, because that\u2019s very risky and expensive,\u201d says Van Klaveren.  \u201cThe value of a 10-year-old A380 fell 60% compared to pre-pandemic, to $30 million compared to around $76 million, which is quite extraordinary. So a lot of [airlines] think they might as well operate them, because it\u2019s costing them money to keep them airworthy.\u201d Two airlines, Thai and Malaysia, have in fact put all of their A380s up for sale, but haven\u2019t found any buyers yet. The only other holdout so far is Etihad; the Abu Dhabi-based airline has 10 in its fleet, but isn\u2019t operating any and it currently has no firm plans to do so. Shorter life Compared to the gloomy predictions of two years ago, it might now be time to imagine a rosier future for the superjumbo. \u201cI think most of the airlines will continue to operate the planes to the end of their life,\u201d says Van Klaveren. \u201cThe question mark is whether that life is more like 18 years rather than 25 years, which is the lifetime of most aircraft. If you compare it to the new generation aircraft, it really is not particularly fuel efficient, so that would suggest that its average age will come down.\u201d Because Emirates has so many A380s, the destiny of the plane will largely rest in its hands. \u201cI think they will get them all flying again, because they\u2019re pretty critical for their business model,\u201d says Van Klaveren. The Dubai-based airline continues to show enthusiastic support for the aircraft.  Tim Clark, Emirates\u2019 president, told AirlineRatings that once the A380 is gone, it will leave a void that can\u2019t be filled by any other aircraft currently in production: \u201cI would build another A380 twice the size because of the zero-emissions engines we have now, with four, possibly three engines,\u201d he added. For now, the A380 continues to be well received by customers across the globe and will remain the airline\u2019s flagship aircraft for many years to come, says Emirates\u2019 Richard Jewsbury. \u201cFor us, the iconic double-decker redefines the travel experience and it will continue to be a vital pillar of our network plans.\u201d ",

            "text": "The White House on Wednesday announced that President Joe Biden is nominating Phil Washington to lead the Federal Aviation Administration. If confirmed, he would be the first Black permanent administrator of the agency.  Washington is currently the chief executive officer of the Denver International Airport \u2013 the third busiest airport in the world. The FAA administrator position has been vacant since late March, when former President Donald Trump\u2019s appointee to the role, Steve Dickson, stepped down halfway through a five-year term. The FAA\u2019s current acting administrator, Billy Nolen, is also Black. Washington\u2019s prospective leadership at the FAA, the agency that regulates civilian aviation in the United States, comes as airlines have experienced immense strain resulting from a ramp up of domestic air travel this summer. Bad weather and staffing shortages across the airline industry have led to a rash of canceled flights throughout the summer holidays \u2013 as American passengers have returned to travel in numbers nearing pre-pandemic levels.  Tracking service FlightAware showed about 2,200 flights canceled between the Thursday and Monday of the Fourth of July weekend \u2013 or 2% of scheduled flights. There was a peak of 657 flights canceled on Saturday. It was the third-straight weekend in which there has been a spike in canceled flights as the airlines struggle to handle the demand for flying with limited crews. The FAA, meanwhile, continues to deal with criticism of its oversight of Boeing, which produces commercial airplanes. The agency is in an ongoing review of Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX 10. Other variants of MAX jets returned to service in 2020 after being grounded for 20 months following two crashes that killed 346 people.  In response to a request from members of Congress, the Department of Transportation\u2019s inspector general will audit the FAA\u2019s oversight of Boeing 737 and 787 production. The IG will evaluate the FAA\u2019s processes for \u201cidentifying and resolving production issues\u201d and \u201caddressing allegations of undue pressure within the production environment.\u201d The FAA is also dealing with how to address the eventual roll out of 5G service near airports. In June, the FAA announced that mobile phone carriers had agreed to another delay of rolling out 5G services for an additional year in order to prevent its interference with some airplane technology.  The delay, the FAA said, will allow more time for the permanent fix: replacing or filtering the devices that measure an aircraft\u2019s distance from the ground, called radar altimeters. The new technology\u2019s promises include faster speeds, but aviation officials say the radio waves can be picked up in some cases by the radar altimeter. If confirmed, Washington will take the helm of an agency with roughly 45,000 employees.  Washington led the Biden-Harris Transportation Department transition team and co-chaired the Biden/Harris Infrastructure Policy Committee. Prior to his position at the Denver airport, Washington was the CEO of the Los Angeles Country Metropolitan Transit Authority for six years. In LA, Washington was part of a major early effort expand the city\u2019s rail network and overhaul the region\u2019s bus network amid steep ridership declines.  Washington, a Chicago native and a US Army veteran, was also previously the CEO of the Denver Regional Transportation District. ",

            "text": "Passengers traveling on an Emirates flight to Brisbane, Australia were stunned when they noticed a huge hole in the side of the aircraft while they were disembarking. Those on board the Airbus A380 from Dubai to the Australian city became aware of the damage as they exited the plane following the roughly 14-hour flight on July 1. Images of the aircraft shared on social media reveal the extent of the puncture, which was due to a ruptured tire caused by a \u201ctechnical fault\u201d during the journey, according to the airline. One of the passengers on board has since taken to Twitter to describe the \u201cterrifying\u201d incident, which took place \u201cduring cruise.\u201d  \u201cWas absolutely terrifying at first and the cabin crew knew something serious may have happened - were immediately in contact with the cockpit,\u201d wrote Andrew Morris, an English professor at the UK\u2019s Loughborough University. \u201cShortly after, they resumed as normal. Their calm demeanor was reassuring \u2013 they knew it was not catastrophic.\u201d While it\u2019s unclear exactly how long the plane had been in the air for when the issue occurred, some reports suggest that it may have been around 45 minutes into the flight. \u2018Technical fault\u2019 Commercial aviation website Aviation Herald reports that the crew advised air traffic controllers at Brisbane Airport of the situation ahead of time and requested that the plane be met by emergency services on landing. Emirates later released a statement stressing that the rupture did not impact \u201cthe fuselage, frame or structure of the aircraft.\u201d \u201cOur flight EK430 flying from Dubai to Brisbane on July 1 experienced a technical fault,\u201d reads the statement.  \u201cOne of the aircraft\u2019s 22 tires ruptured during cruise, causing damage to a small portion of the aerodynamic fairing, which is an outer panel or the skin of the aircraft.\u201d The airline went on to confirm that the aircraft had landed safely in Australia, and passengers had disembarked as scheduled. Damage to the exterior of the wide-body airliner has since been repaired.  \u201cThe fairing has been completely replaced, checked and cleared by engineers, Airbus and all relevant authorities,\u201d adds Emirates. \u201cThe safety of our passengers and crew has always been our top priority.\u201d The incident came just days after the much-loved A380 superjumbo, in decline prior to the pandemic, was given something of a reprieve, when German airline Lufthansa announced plans to redeploy the plane from summer 2023. The Airbus A380 has been on its way out since Airbus announced in 2019 that it was ceasing production of the airliner. CNN has contacted Emirates for further comment. Top image credit: Avherald.com",

            "text": "Top-of-the-line F-35 stealth fighter jets from the United States and South Korea are teaming up for the first time in a 10-day exercise meant to send a message to North Korea. Six US Air Force F-35As from Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska arrived in South Korea on Tuesday and will fly with F-35s from the host nation in a series of exercises ending July 14, the two militaries said. \u201cThis deployment is aimed at enhancing the interoperability of (our air forces) while demonstrating the strong deterrence and joint defense posture of the alliance,\u201d the South Korean Defense Ministry said. A South Korean spokesperson said this is the first time stealth fighters from the two allies have worked together. Experts say stealth fighters able to evade Pyongyang\u2019s radars would be vital in any action against North Korea. The deployment of the US fighters is a visible sign of the commitment US President Joe Biden made to his South Korean counterpart, Yoon Suk Yeol, when the two met in Seoul in May. \u201cConsidering the evolving threat posed by (North Korea), both leaders agree to initiate discussions to expand the scope and scale of combined military exercises and training on and around the Korean Peninsula,\u201d the White House said after the two presidents met. \u201cBoth leaders also reaffirm the commitment of the US to deploy strategic US military assets in a timely and coordinated manner as necessary.\u201d  Tensions with North Korea have been increasing in recent months. Pyongyang has been testing missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads at a record pace, with at least 17 launches this year.  The US military said the American F-35s would operate alongside other US aircraft during their deployment, without giving specifics. But working with the South Korean F-35s is the main event. The F-35 is one of the world\u2019s most advanced fighter aircraft. The US operates hundreds of the jets, which come in three configurations, the conventional take-off and landing F-35As, flown by the Air Force; the Marine Corps\u2019 F-35Bs, which can land vertically; and the F-35C, configured for aircraft carrier operations. Like the US Air Force, the South Korean Air Force flies the F-35A, with its first jet delivered by manufacturer Lockheed Martin in 2018. Its fleet of 40 of the fifth-generation jets became fully operational this spring. On March 25, a day after one of Pyongyang\u2019s missile tests, Seoul staged an \u201celephant walk\u201d of its F-35 fleet, lining up the jets all at once on a runway in a display of power. \u201cUsing the F-35A stealth fighters, the invisible power capable of stealth infiltration and precise striking, we will achieve an overwhelming strategic victory and maintain a full military posture that will deter further actions by North Korea,\u201d then-Defense Minister Suh Wook said during the elephant walk. The last reported deployment of US F-35s to South Korea came in 2017, when they joined F-22 stealth fighters in what at the time was described as the largest concentration of fifth-generation fighter jets ever in South Korea. Those warplanes were part of a massive annual US-South Korea exercise named Vigilant Ace, which was canceled later under the Donald Trump administration as the then-US President tried to entice North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un into giving up his nuclear missile programs. After three meetings between Trump and Kim failed to yield an agreement, North Korea has ramped up its missile program. The US and South Korea fear Pyongyang may try to test a nuclear weapon soon, something it has not done since 2017. ",

Here at CNN Travel, we\u2019re riding out the price hikes, the flight cancellations and the chaos, and we are just grateful restrictions are easing and the open(ish) road is ahead.  Here\u2019s the latest in travel from around the world this week.  Cabin interiors Tucked away on wide-body aircraft well out of sight of passengers, there are secret spaces with bunks and power outlets that resemble Japanese-style capsule hotels. They\u2019re called crew rest compartments, and their location on the plane varies. Get the lowdown on them here. Also in airplane bunk beds, Air New Zealand has just announced its \u201cSkynest\u201d concept: full-length sleeping pods available to economy passengers. It\u2019ll be among the offerings included on its new Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which are due to enter into service in 2024. On the upper end of the luxury scale, there\u2019s Germany\u2019s Lufthansa Technik, which recently developed a cabin concept inspired by that must-have item for the ultrarich, the superyacht. We\u2019re talking yacht-like luxury right down to having a sauna, steam room and a retractable veranda.  Travel connections Disneyland famously claims to be the happiest place on Earth, but for Renata and Brian Mehl, there was a little more magic in the air than usual when they met at the Anaheim resort in January 2012. A Disney proposal followed, and now the Californian pair is celebrating a decade together.  And here\u2019s another meeting brought about by an accident of fate. Two women with the same name, Kimberly Pflieger, became friends after becoming aware of each other online. The two women \u2013 one Canadian, one Californian \u2013 went hiking with their partners in Malibu and have further adventures planned together.   News from Asia Porcupines, armadillos, turtles, lizards and snakes were among the 109 live animals discovered by X-ray in two pieces of luggage at Bangkok\u2019s Suvarnabhumi Airport this week. Two women have been arrested and charged with smuggling.  The tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, another contender for happiest place on Earth, will reopen to international tourists in September for the first time since the pandemic began. Travelers will face a much heftier daily tourist tax, though: It\u2019s now $200 per night, up from $65.  It\u2019s not the only Asian destination to raise prices. Indonesia\u2019s Borobudur, the world\u2019s largest Buddhist temple, is also set for a massive price hike.  Alternative transport So how will we all be getting from A to B by the 2050s? There are plenty of exciting new vehicle concepts in development.  Maybe it\u2019ll be \u201cflying ferries\u201d that promise to get us to work in half the time.  Or perhaps by solar-assisted vehicle: A solar-paneled car will go into production this year, and a butterfly-shaped solar-powered trailer is on a four-year trip around the world.  And finally, there are airships: Spanish airline Air Nostrum has just ordered 10 Airlander 10 hybrid aircraft with delivery scheduled for 2026 Australia\u2019s abandoned places In case you missed it Photographer Brett Patman has spent the past decade documenting Australia\u2019s abandoned places, from industrial sites to hotels.

            "text": "SpaceX\u2019s satellite-based internet business, Starlink, now has approval from the US government to expand its service to planes, ships, automobiles, RVs and other mobile vehicles.  The move sets the company up to expand its customer base, which so far has been focused solely on providing roughly $100-per-month internet services to homes, mostly in areas that aren\u2019t serviced by traditional ground-based internet service. It has hundreds of thousands of subscribers around the world. Now, the company is likely to begin rolling out service to commercial airlines, possibly beginning with Hawaiian Airlines, which signed a deal with SpaceX in April saying it planned to bring complimentary Starlink services to some jets.  The regulatory approval, handed down from the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday, also grants SpaceX the ability to expand its service to trains, ships, and other vehicles, opening up a broad swath of potential corporate customers. The company has also already been advertising its services for RV drivers.  Traditionally, airlines, ships and trains have relied on satellites in geosynchronous orbit, a band of orbit that lies more than 22,000 miles away, provided by companies such as ViaSat. SpaceX\u2019s Starlink takes a different approach to beaming internet from space by putting thousands of satellites in low-Earth orbit, or just a few hundred miles off the ground. The company says this offers lower latency, or lag times, for its service. It\u2019s not clear how Starlink\u2019s mobile services may be priced, but SpaceX does already market its service directly to businesses. \u201cWith more than double the antenna capability of Starlink, Starlink Business delivers faster internet speeds and higher throughput,\u201d the company states on its website. \u201c$500/mo with a one-time hardware cost of $2,500.\u201d SpaceX also rolled out Starlink for RVs earlier this year for $135 per month, though prior to this week\u2019s FCC approval, the service focused on providing internet to RVs only when they are stationary. For those hoping to have internet access rolled out directly to their cars, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter last year that likely won\u2019t be the case, saying \u201cNot connecting Tesla cars to Starlink, as our terminal is much too big. This is for aircraft, ships, large trucks & RVs.\u201d The FCC\u2019s decision also marks yet another chapter in an ongoing battle over spectrum rights. Spectrum refers to a range of radio frequencies, and federal regulators closely guard what companies are allowed to use which frequencies so that signals don\u2019t interfere with one another.   Companies including ViaSat, Dish Network, and wireless company RS Access petitioned against the FCC\u2019s decision. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment for this story.",

            "text": "The race to resume supersonic passenger flights nearly two decades after the retirement of Concorde was offered a glimmer of excitement on Monday when plane manufacturer Bombardier revealed high speed achievements while confirming the launch of its new business jet.  The Canadian company said the in-development Global 8000 will be \u201cthe world\u2019s fastest and longest-range purpose-built business jet.\u201d  With a capacity for up to 19 passengers, a range of 8,000 nautical miles (14,800 kilometers) and a top speed of Mach 0.94, the upcoming plane is expected to enter service in 2025, according to a statement from Bombardier. The news comes after a Global 7500 test vehicle broke the sound barrier during a demonstration flight last May, achieving speeds of more than Mach 1.015.  Supersonic breakthrough The aircraft, accompanied by a NASA F/A-18 chase plane, also became the first Transport Category airplane to fly supersonic with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as a result of the flight, says Bombardier. \u201cThe Global 8000 aircraft leverages the outstanding attributes of the Global 7500 aircraft, providing our customers with a flagship aircraft of a new era,\u201d \u00c9ric Martel, president and CEO for Bombardier, said in a statement released on Monday. Flight testing for the Global 8000 has already begun on Global 7500 flight-test vehicles. Bombardier says the upcoming aircraft will also have a cabin altitude equivalent to 2,900 feet.  New era Global 8000 is just one of many developments in the numerous efforts to raise the speed of passenger aircraft more than two decades after Concorde retired. Last year, United Airlines announced it could be offering supersonic routes as early as 2029 after striking a deal to buy 15 supersonic jets. Meanwhile, Colorado-based Boom Supersonic has been completing ground testing on X-B1, the prototype aircraft for its Overture jet, designed to seat between 65 and 88 people, which aims to fly on over 500 mainly transoceanic routes that will benefit from the aircraft\u2019s Mach-2.2 speeds. Sadly, Florida-based aviation startup Aerion collapsed months after revealing plans for a Mach 4+ commercial airliner named Aerion AS3 last year.  Top image credit: Bombardier Aviation",

            "text": "Lori Garver spearheaded the NASA program that paved the way for SpaceX to return human spaceflight to the United States after a decade-long wait. In her new book and in a recent interview she reflects on that success, the controversial cast of characters driving this new space race, and the cultural issues that permeate the aerospace industry at large.  And the former NASA deputy administrator, when asked by CNN Business how SpaceX\u2019s future might play out, had a message for Elon Musk: Don\u2019t trip on your ego, adding that the perils and politics of spaceflight are already potential risks to the company\u2019s future. In her new memoir, \u201cEscaping Gravity,\u201d Garver wrote about her feelings watching the success of NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, the initiative that brought about the first privately owned human spacecraft that culminated in SpaceX\u2019s historic 2020 astronaut launch.  \u201cSpaceX has a huge lead and is running faster than any of the competition, including all the big aerospace companies,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTo me, that is both fantastic and scary at the same time.\u201d She adds that, \u201c[e]scaping gravity is not a simple maneuver and in the coming years it will be impossible to beat it safely every time. The private sector will have to answer to its customers for missteps that lead to bad outcomes. Only time will tell if they will be given the opportunity to correct their errors and continue as NASA has been allowed to do in the past.\u201d In an interview with CNN Business, Garver also said she was disheartened to read recent reporting alleging toxicity within SpaceX\u2019s corporate culture amid Musk\u2019s erratic behavior on Twitter and a broader \u201cbro culture,\u201d as she put it, that permeates the aerospace industry. Garver warned that if companies don\u2019t get serious about addressing issues like harassment and lack of inclusivity, \u201cthey will lose workforce.\u201d \u201cThese rockets don\u2019t build themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThe best and the brightest, they aren\u2019t going to put up with behavior that is truly a distraction\u2026The bro culture could succeed in the past because the predominant number of engineers were white males. That is no longer the case. And we absolutely benefit from all comers. All views.\u201d SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment for this story, nor has it responded to routine inquiries from reporters in years. In her book, Garver also recounts the harassment she said she endured during her career in aerospace, which spanned NASA as well as various other corporate and government jobs. Being objectified was simply \u201ca part of being a woman working in aerospace when I was in my twenties and thirties,\u201d she said. In her book, she recalls one NASA supervisor who once \u201ctold me to come into his office so I could get my birthday spanking\u201d in front of several colleagues. In a separate incident, Garver recalled being in Moscow in her thirties when \u201ca senior aerospace contractor who had been over-served pushed his way into my hotel room, shoving me onto the bed.\u201d \u201cI was able to get out from under him and run into the hall, finding a colleague to intervene,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI never reported the incident to NASA or to his employer. Embarrassed and assuming it would be my own career that suffered, I\u2014like so many others\u2014swept such occurrences under the rug,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed for many reasons, but mostly because the behavior likely continued.\u201d \u201cIt is time to end justifications for rooted misconduct as well as the field\u2019s predominance of people\u2014including in its leadership\u2014who look and think the same way,\u201d Garver wrote. \u201cProgress toward diversity, equity, and inclusion has been much too slow.\u201d When Garver was selected to become NASA\u2019s second-in-command in 2009, she said she had already been thinking for decades about shaking up the space agency\u2019s contracting policies. The old way, known as \u201ccost-plus\u201d contracting, in some ways gave NASA\u2019s corporate partners a blank check to get projects done, and they were routinely delayed and over budget. The contracting method that Garver and a small contingent of others pioneered for human spaceflight programs at NASA is what\u2019s come to be known as the commercial contracting structure. It allows companies to compete for contracts before NASA doles out fixed amounts of money. If projects run over budget, it is up to the contractors to cover the cost. But many aerospace stakeholders pushed back, arguing that human spaceflight programs were too technologically complex and expensive for multiple companies to attempt. It was a contentious and fraught battle to attempt to change the system, Garver recalls.  \u201cSenior industry and government officials took pleasure in deriding [SpaceX] and Elon in the early years,\u201d Garver wrote in her book. \u201cTo me, this seemed irresponsible.\u201d At one point, Garver described herself as one of Musk\u2019s \u201cmost ardent supporters [and] defenders.\u201d Ultimately, the Commercial Crew Program was approved and funded by Congress. SpaceX and Boeing were both chosen for multi-billion dollar contracts, and two years ago, SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon spacecraft safely delivered its first crew of astronauts to the International Space Station. The company has since completed three additional launches for NASA astronauts as well as two purely commercial missions for wealthy thrillseekers. (Boeing is still working to get its Starliner spacecraft operational but completed a test flight last month.) SpaceX\u2019s success won over many of the Commercial Crew Program\u2019s former skeptics. Still, Garver admits that she did not expect SpaceX would be the standout in the commercial space race. When she was first imagining this new approach to awarding contracts, it was \u201cso long before the billionaire investors in space\u201d were part of the public imagination. \u201cWe always thought it would be [legacy] aerospace companies,\u201d such as Lockheed Martin or Boeing, she told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we envisioned for a number of reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst being that we didn\u2019t envision billionaires amassing this many billions.\u201d",

Costly to run, the world\u2019s largest passenger aircraft\u2019s demise was apparently accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic travel slump, but now German airline Lufthansa \u2013 which had been selling off its grounded A380s and was understood to be retiring the aircraft from its fleet \u2013 has announced plans to redeploy the huge plane from summer 2023. In a statement released on Monday, Lufthansa said the aircraft was returning \u201cin response to the steep rise in customer demand and the delayed delivery of ordered aircraft,\u201d noting the A380 remains popular with its crew, as well as passengers. Return of the superjumbo  Lufthansa has sold six of its A380s over the last couple of years and the airline has eight superjumbos remaining in its fleet. These aircraft are currently in \u201cdeep storage\u201d in Spain and France.  The German flag carrier says it\u2019s still assessing how many A380s will be reactivated, and is figuring out what routes they might fly on. Typically airlines deploy superjumbos on long-haul, popular routes. The size of the aircraft makes them costly to run, so there has to be demand to justify it. While in recent years the A380 appeared to be on the way out, Lufthansa\u2019s decision suggests the A380\u2019s not consigned to the history books just yet. Superjumbos also remain in Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Korean Air, All Nippon Airways and British Airways\u2019 fleets. Upon delivery of the final A380 in December 2021, Emirates president Tim Clark said it will \u201cremain Emirates\u2019 flagship product for the coming years.\u201d Singapore Airlines, meanwhile, acknowledged the passenger appeal of the superjumbo when announcing plans to reinstate the aircraft last year. \u201cSome people just book the A380 specifically to fly on it,\u201d Siva Govindasamy, Singapore Airlines\u2019 global public affairs head, told CNN Travel. Earlier this year, an Airbus A380 also completed a test flight powered by Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF \u2013 a type of fuel predominantly made of used cooking oil and waste fats \u2013 and operating on a single Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine.",

This follows another chaotic travel weekend with more than 1,500 domestic flights canceled Saturday and Sunday. Delta alone canceled at least 224 flights Monday, or 7% of its operations, while United canceled 128 flights and American Airlines\n            \n                (AAL) nixed 67. CNN has reached out to the three airlines for comment on the flight cancellations.  \u201cDelta teams continue to safely manage through compounding factors affecting our operation this weekend, including higher-than-planned unscheduled absences in some of our work groups, weather, and air traffic control constraints,\u201d a Delta Air Lines spokesperson said Sunday. \u201cCanceling a flight is always our last resort, and we sincerely apologize to our customers for any disruption to their travel plans.\u201d It\u2019s going to be a summer of travel hell, experts warn. Though airlines received $54 billion in federal assistance during Covid\u2019s peak to avoid involuntary layoffs, they now have fewer employees than before the pandemic \u2014 especially pilots \u2014 after offering buyouts and early retirement packages to trim staff and save money. As a result, operations can quickly fall apart when there\u2019s bad weather, understaffed air traffic control centers or sick staff. Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and the New York City area\u2019s Newark Liberty International were most impacted by Monday\u2019s cancellations, with Newark alone accounting for more than 100 canceled flights.  United  \u2014 which canceled 56 flights on Saturday and 70 flights Sunday \u2014 had said last Thursday it would cut 12% of its daily domestic flights from its busy Newark hub. The cuts start in July and amount to about 50 daily flights.  According to FlightAware, there were 634 US flight cancellations Saturday and 868 canceled Sunday. \u201cMore than any time in our history, the various factors currently impacting our operation \u2014 weather and air traffic control, vendor staffing, increased Covid case rates contributing to higher-than-planned unscheduled absences in some work groups \u2014 are resulting in an operation that isn\u2019t consistently up to the standards Delta has set for the industry in recent years,\u201d said Delta Chief Customer Experience Officer Allison Ausband in an online post. But critics say airlines should have anticipated these issues ahead of the summer travel season.  \u201cWhen you stress-test the airline operation model, that\u2019s when you see the same results,\u201d Capt. Dennis Tajer, spokesperson for the Allied Pilots Association, the pilots union at American Airlines, said earlier this month. With flights already booked to capacity, \u201cone flight being canceled doesn\u2019t just cause a cascading effect, it causes a tidal wave of problems. It\u2019s d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again,\u201d Tajer added, referencing the chaotic holiday travel season late last year. ",

            "text": "China made a big statement about its naval ambitions with the recent launch of its third and most advanced aircraft carrier. The Fujian \u2013 by far China\u2019s biggest, most modern and most powerful aircraft carrier to date \u2013 is the 80,000-ton jewel in the crown of a military expansion that has seen Beijing grow its navy into the world\u2019s largest. Its new combat systems \u2013 such as an electromagnetic catapult-assisted launch system \u2013 show China is fast catching up with the United States, experts say, and will give it the ability to launch more aircraft, more quickly, and with more ammunition. That should be enough to give any would-be opponent pause for thought, especially given China\u2019s increasing aggression in its territorial disputes with Japan in the East China Sea, a host of Southeast Asian nations in the South China Sea, and its repeated harassment of the self-governed island of Taiwan \u2013 where it has pointedly refused to rule out an invasion.  Still, while the launch of the Fujian amid much fanfare was clearly meant as a message to Beijing\u2019s rivals, analysts caution against swallowing too much of the hype just yet. Firstly, the Fujian likely won\u2019t be operational for another three to four years, said Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center. And even when it is operational, its size will make it an obvious target \u2013 any enemy will be keenly aware that sinking such an iconic vessel would be as much of a morale blow as a military disaster for China. Then there is the simple fact that, impressive as they seem, aircraft carriers aren\u2019t necessarily best suited to what experts see as the most plausible conflict scenarios in the near future \u2013 including clashes in the East and South China Seas and an invasion of Taiwan.   Essentially, experts say, the Fujian might be China\u2019s biggest ship, but it\u2019s probably not the biggest problem on the minds of US naval commanders right now. Here are four types of ship at China\u2019s disposal that arguably pose a far greater threat to US naval dominance.  Type 055 destroyer Launched in 2017, these 13,000-ton stealth guided-missile destroyers are considered by many to be the most powerful surface combatants in the world. The Type 055, big enough to be considered a cruiser by NATO standards, is equipped with 112 vertical launch tubes that can used to fire everything from anti-ship missiles to long-range land-attack missiles. \u201cThis ship in particular has a sophisticated design, stealth features, radars, and a large missile inventory. It is larger and more powerful than most US, Japanese, and South Korean destroyers,\u201d RAND Corp. senior analyst Timothy Heath told CNN in 2018, when Beijing launched two of the warships in a single day \u2013 a testament to China\u2019s impressive shipbuilding capabilities. A US Congressional Research Service report in March said at least 10 Type 055s are thought to have been launched or are under construction. The deployment of the Lhasa, the second of Beijing\u2019s five active Type 055s, to the Sea of Japan for drills amid growing tensions over Taiwan, was championed by China\u2019s state-run Global Times tabloid last week.  \u201cThe ship has achieved full operational capability and demonstrated its capabilities in deterring possible foreign military interference in the Taiwan Strait at a time when the US and Japan have been repeatedly provoking China over the Taiwan question,\u201d the Global Times reported. The potency of the Type 055 was underlined in footage that emerged on social media in April. It showed one launching what naval analyst H I Sutton said was a hypersonic YJ-21 anti-ship ballistic missile \u2013 a weapon often referred to as a \u201ccarrier killer.\u201d Global Times played down the footage, describing the missiles as part of the country\u2019s defensive strategy. \u201cIf the US does not make military provocations against China, including over the Taiwan question, it does not need to worry about the missiles,\u201d it said.  Type 039 submarine These Yuan-class submarines are almost silent diesel-electric-powered boats with capabilities that could prove tough for US military planners to deal with. Beijing has built 17 of the Type 39A/B subs, with plans to increase that total to 25 in the next three years, according to the US Defense Department\u2019s 2021 report to Congress on China\u2019s military power. \u201cThe Type 039 SSs provide formidable \u2018defense in depth\u2019\u201d in waters close to China, \u201cand they appear to be developing some capability to engage\u201d US forces farther out to sea, Schuster said. The subs are equipped with air independent propulsion (AIP), which means they do not need to surface as frequently to get the air required for diesel combustion, which can then power their batteries. \u201cWhen operating on batteries, AIP-equipped submarines are almost silent, with the only noise coming from the shaft bearings, propeller, and flow around the hull,\u201d US Navy officers Michael Walker and Austin Krusz wrote in a 2018 report for the US Naval Institute\u2019s Proceedings magazine.  China is pushing to launch more of the super-quiet subs, which are armed with anti-ship cruise missiles, the Defense Department report said. One potent method of attack used by the Type 039 is to fire a \u201cwake-homing\u201d torpedo across the stern, or back, of a target vessel. The torpedo then follows in the wake of the target ship before exploding near its propulsion and steering systems.  Because surface ships detect submarines and torpedoes by sound waves, wake-homing torpedoes are particularly tough to defend against. The advances in Chinese submarines come just as the US Navy is experiencing trouble with its anti-submarine capabilities. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday told Congress last month that the service wants to scrap nine of its littoral combat ships, some of the newest ships in the US fleet, because their anti-submarine systems \u201cdid not work out technically.\u201d  Merchant ferries Merchant ferries might not be the first thing that springs to mind when you think about deadly naval capabilities \u2013 but therein lies their power. To invade Taiwan, China would likely need to transport an invading force of hundreds of thousands of men \u2013 some analysts have suggested more than a million would be needed. Various analysts \u2013 and US government reports \u2013 have concluded the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s (PLA) naval fleet is not up to that task. But what China does have is a massive fleet of civilian ferries that could be swiftly converted for military use \u2013 and according to some, may even have been designed for just that possibility. \u201cChina\u2019s biggest ferry shipbuilder stated publicly in 2015 that one of its largest roll-on/roll-off ferries was built for dual military and civilian purposes, and one of China\u2019s largest ferry operators has been similarly described as having a dual civil-military development philosophy,\u201d Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submarine commander now a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, wrote in a 2021 essay for War on the Rocks. He added that civilian ferry companies operating in the Yellow and South China Seas have already been organized into PLA auxiliary units.  Crunching the numbers, said Shugart, was staggering. He estimated that using civilian ships would give China an extra 1.1 million displacement tonnes. That figure is more than three times the displacement tonnage of all of China\u2019s amphibious assault ships put together. And if China tapped Hong Kong\u2019s roll-on/roll-off vehicle carriers it could gain an extra 370,000 tonnes of sealift, according to Shugart. Is that enough to take Taiwan by force?  That is hard to know. But Shugart said it did answer one question. \u201cHow many transport (ships) does the Chinese military have? Very probably, more than you might think.\u201d  Maritime militia Ferries aren\u2019t the only supposedly civilian vessels military planners have on their radars. Experts also accuse China of creating a maritime militia, made up of more than a hundred vessels supposedly engaged in commercial fishing, to enforce its wishes in disputed seas. The militia \u2013 which Beijing denies even exists \u2013 is made up of at least 122 vessels and likely as many as 174, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But the actual number could be even greater. Various experts suspected the militia\u2019s involvement when more than 200 Chinese fishing boats crowded the waters around Whitsun Reef in the South China Sea in early 2021. The reef is claimed by both China and the Philippines, which described the presence of the boats as a \u201cclear provocative action.\u201d  \u201cThe People\u2019s Armed Forces Maritime Militia don\u2019t fish,\u201d Schuster told CNN last year. \u201cThey have automatic weapons aboard and reinforced hulls, making them very dangerous at close range. Also, they have a top speed of around 18-22 knots, making them faster than 90% of the world\u2019s fishing boats.\u201d The militia has two main parts: professional militia boats and actual fishing boats employed by the Chinese military under a subsidy scheme, according to a November report from the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).  The professionals lead such activities as harassing foreign drilling ships or blocking foreign fishing boats, and the subsidized fishers bring pressure in numbers, the CSIS report said. And with the world\u2019s largest fishing fleet, China has plenty of reserves to call on. About that carrier again Still, none of this is to say that the launch of the Fujian is not a significant moment.  As in the US, aircraft carriers will in time become the centerpiece of the PLA\u2019s navy \u2013 and a symbol of what the modern Chinese military is capable of, Schuster said. \u201cFujian\u2019s launch should be viewed for what it portends rather than its limited immediate impact,\u201d Schuster said.  \u201cChina has now launched three carriers and brought two into full operational status during a period where the US Navy has struggled to bring one new unit to full operational status,\u201d he said. Schuster was referring to the USS Gerald Ford, a supercarrier that has been plagued by problems since its commissioning in 2017 (by which time it was already three years late). The supercarrier is yet to make its first operational deployment, though that is expected this fall. Meanwhile, China forges ahead. \u201cThey are building their navy at a faster rate than the US and all of its allies,\u201d Schuster said. \u201cImperfect, but a good foundation.\u201d",

Buffett\u2019s conglomerate now owns a 16.3% stake in Occidental Petroleum\n            \n                (OXY), making it by far the largest owner of the stock. Mutual fund giant Vanguard is the second biggest investor, with a nearly 11% position in the company. Occidental Petroleum is the best performer in the S&P 500 this year, rising 92% as crude prices have soared. Shares were up more than 3% in early trading Thursday. But Occidental Petroleum isn\u2019t the only energy company that Berkshire loves. Chevron\n            \n                (CVX), the Dow\u2019s top stock of 2022, is also a favorite of Buffett and his investing team. (Berkshire executives Ted Weschler and Todd Combs run the portfolio along with the Oracle of Omaha.) Berkshire disclosed at its annual shareholder meeting in May that Chevron was one of the company\u2019s core holdings as of the end of the first quarter.  Berkshire said it owned a nearly $26 billion stake in the oil giant, a position that trailed only its stakes in Apple\n            \n                (AAPL), Bank of America\n            \n                (BAC) and American Express\n            \n                (AXP) at the time. The value of Berkshire\u2019s long-time holding in Coca-Cola\n            \n                (KO) has since eclipsed that of both Chevron and AmEx. The oil and energy business is also an important part of Berkshire\u2019s overall operating business. The company\u2019s energy subsidiary owns leading electric utilities including PacifiCorp and MidAmerican, oil and natural gas pipelines and several renewable power companies. Greg Abel, the Berkshire vice chairman who oversees Berkshire Energy and the company\u2019s other non-financial businesses, was tapped last year to eventually succeed the 91-year-old Buffett as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway.

            "text": "Jeff Bezos \u2014 the billionaire founder of Amazon and rocket company Blue Origin \u2014 made a grand public announcement a year ago that he purchased a ship to capture Blue Origin rockets after they return from space, and he named the vessel after his mother. But now the company says it is doing away with that plan, seeking a more \u201ccost effective\u201d alternative, Blue Origin spokesperson Linda Mills said. It is not clear what will happen to the Jacklyn, as the ship is called, which Bezos dedicated to his mother in a small ceremony in Pensacola, Florida in December 2020. Blue Origin could still use the ship for another purpose or abandon the project altogether. Mills said the company is \u201cstill assessing options.\u201d One alternative to the big ship is to opt for an autonomous, seafaring platform or barge, much like the droneships that SpaceX uses to catch its rockets after flight.  Blue Origin wanted to sail the Jacklyn out into the Atlantic Ocean to catch its New Glenn rocket boosters. When the large first-stage booster that gives the initial thrust at liftoff expends most of its fuel, it is designed to detach from the upper stage of the rocket and make a controlled pinpoint landing on Earth, just as SpaceX already does with its Falcon 9 rockets. Blue Origin\u2019s website still references landing its rockets on a ship, rather than a barge, touting that it allows the booster to land in turbulent ocean conditions. Theoretically, a massive ship could remain steady in rough waters, allowing Blue Origin to carry out its booster retrieval operations in all types of weather.  But that plan would have required the Jacklyn, a former cargo ship built in 2004, to undergo extensive retrofitting \u2014 including the installation of a massive platform for the rocket to target. Mills declined to say how much the refurbishments would have cost. Landing rocket boosters instead of discarding them in the ocean, as other rocket companies have done for decades, is at the core of SpaceX\u2019s and Blue Origin\u2019s plans to bring down the cost of a launch and ensure profitability.  Blue Origin\u2019s New Glenn rocket is planned to be the first of the company\u2019s rockets that will be capable of reaching orbit, a trek that requires speeds topping 17,000 miles per hour. SpaceX has sent rockets into orbit since 2008.  So far, Blue Origin has only conducted flights of its much smaller New Shepard suborbital rocket. That rocket has been used to carry paying customers \u2014 and last summer, Bezos himself \u2014 on brief, supersonic joy rides that reach the edge of what is technically considered space.  New Glenn is not expected to carry humans, at least at first, but will instead haul satellites and other cargo to orbit.  Though already a couple of years behind its original schedule, Blue Origin is hoping to launch the first New Glenn to orbit by the end of 2022.  Despite the New Glenn never having flown, it has already landed several commercial satellite launch contracts, and NASA selected the rocket as one able to compete for missions that would launch planetary, Earth observation, exploration and scientific satellites.",

            "title": "What sitting in economy on Qantas\u2019 20-hour flights will be like",
            "text": "The world\u2019s longest flight: nonstop, 20 hours, as you recline in your wide armchair and decide whether you want to relax with the very best Champagne, enjoy a chef-designed meal with a traveling companion seated opposite, or get the crew to make your sumptuously soft bed with fresh linens.  That\u2019s what\u2019s on offer for the six first-class passengers on board Qantas\u2019 Project Sunrise direct flights to Sydney from London and New York starting three years from now, and they can expect to pay the best part of five figures for it.  What about the 140 economy class passengers who will be at the back of the 12 Airbus A350-1000s that the airline has ordered to work on the service?  Qantas isn\u2019t telling. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any updates at the moment but we are eager to keep you updated, and will share more when we have it,\u201d a spokesperson told us. We do know, though, that Qantas is already planning a Wellbeing Zone, which looks to be an area around one of the galley kitchens where you can stretch, maybe do some yoga poses, and possibly just stand around for a while.  And, of course, Qantas will work hard at having a great selection of movies and TV shows for you to enjoy on big new inflight entertainment screens, as well as food and beverages that it\u2019ll design especially for your wellbeing on longer flights. But that\u2019s likely it.  Ian Petchenik, host of the AvTalk aviation podcast, tells CNN that \u201cwhile a lot of attention has been paid to Qantas\u2019 first class for Project Sunrise, I think the real differentiator for passengers in the back of the aircraft is going to be the soft product. \u201cYou can only improve nine-abreast economy seating so much, so finding ways to make a 20-hour flight in one of those seats palatable is going to come down to what else Qantas can offer those passengers.\u201d I\u2019m a specialist aviation journalist with more than a decade going in-depth with all kinds of people at airlines, airplane manufacturers, designers, and seatmakers to figure out how every inch of the plane is used. And since Qantas isn\u2019t talking, here are my professional deductions about what\u2019s likely to be on offer on board. First off, there isn\u2019t much likelihood of anything really revolutionary. The three years to 2025 aren\u2019t a long time in aviation, especially when it comes to seats. Unless Qantas is planning some sort of big bunk reveal \u2013 which would require a massive amount of safety certification work \u2013 it seems pretty certain that economy passengers will just be in normal seats. Knees and shins Going back to first principles, comfort levels in economy class seats are mostly based on seat style, pitch and width. In terms of seat style, Qantas can be expected to pick up the very best economy class seats on the market from the top design and engineering firms, like Recaro or Collins Aerospace.  These are called fully featured seats, with comfortable engineered seat foams covered by special fabrics, a substantial amount of recline, a substantial headrest, underseat footrest, and in Qantas\u2019 case a small foot hammock.  In recent years, designers and engineers have worked hard on the backs and bases of airplane seats so that they give enough space to the person sitting behind \u2013 particularly for their knees and shins.  They\u2019ve figured out how to make the cushioned bottom of the chair, known as the seat pan, articulate when reclined, changing the pressure points on the occupant\u2019s body as they lean back. Qantas\u2019 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, which launched in 2016, used a customized version of German manufacturer Recaro\u2019s CL3710 seat.  The CL3710 dates back to 2013, and Recaro has been making updates each year, but it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if it was working on a special version for Qantas. There might even be a brand new seat \u2013 from Recaro or someone else \u2013 with even more comfort. That could well be ready for Qantas to start flying in late 2025. Extra legroom The second factor in comfort is pitch, which measures the point on one seat to the point on the same seat immediately in front of it, so it\u2019s not quite total legroom because it includes an inch or two of seatback structure. Qantas has promised that its economy class seats on board will offer 33 inches (84 centimeters) of pitch.  That\u2019s one inch more than the 2016 Dreamliner seats, and by 2025 I\u2019d expect the seat engineering to have narrowed the seat structure by up to an inch to offer more knee space. It wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if Qantas offered extra-legroom sections too, which might stretch to 35 or 36 inches, along the lines of United\u2019s Economy Plus or Delta\u2019s Comfort Plus \u2013 not premium economy, but just normal economy seats with more legroom. What about width?  There\u2019s either great news or terrible news ahead for passengers, depending on how many seats Qantas puts in each row of the A350.  The big twin-aisle plane can either hold nine seats per row, which has been the standard that full-service airlines like Qantas, Delta and Singapore Airlines have offered, or 10 seats per row, which has largely been aboard ultra-low-cost and leisure carriers like France\u2019s Air Cara\u00efbes and French Bee. Width-wise, the A350 is one of the most comfortable economy class options in the air at nine-across with seats over 18 inches wide. At 10-across, it\u2019s one of the least comfortable, with seats barely scraping 17 inches and super-narrow aisles too. You might imagine \u2013 and Qantas\u2019 published cutaway certainly shows \u2013 that a full-service airline like Australia\u2019s flag carrier would naturally go for the nine-across configuration.  But Airbus has been hatching a quiet plan to carve out an inch or two of extra space by slimming down the cabin sidewalls. That\u2019s led some full-service airlines, including Abu Dhabi-based Etihad, to plan to install 10-across seating on some future A350s. Nonstop vs. stopover Qantas says that it plans to install 140 economy class seats on its A350. That would be 14 rows of 10, but that number doesn\u2019t divide neatly into nine, even if you try to add some extra seats on the sides or in the middle.  It would still be surprising to see Qantas do that, especially for these super-long flights. But the airline installed seats almost as narrow on its Dreamliner seats that fly nonstop London-Perth for nearly as long, so watch this space for details. At the end of the day, every inch matters when it comes to economy class comfort. Many passengers \u2013 me included \u2013 wince at the idea of a 20-hour-plus flight, even in business class.  I\u2019ve done something almost as long in business class, on Singapore Airlines\u2019 nonstop from Newark to Singapore about 10 years ago, but it wasn\u2019t much fun, even with the ability to go from movie to sleeping and back again.  Whenever we end up talking about this, people always bring up the other option, a stretch halfway from New York to Sydney in Los Angeles or San Francisco, or in any of a dozen top-notch airports in Asia between Sydney and London. But people have always winced at spending longer in a seat: first at the idea of a single-hop Kangaroo Route flight, then at the idea of a flight lasting 12, 14 or 16 hours. Before the pandemic, there were dozens of flights longer than that, with regular economy class seats down the back, and people seemed willing to sit in them.  The question is just how much of a difference that extra three or four hours over the London-Perth Qantas 787 Dreamliner flight will make to passengers \u2013 and, crucially, to their perceptions. ",

The ecoDemonstrator will reportedly go through a six-month series of tests both on the ground and in the sky, starting this summer.  Among the 30 or so technologies set for testing during the campaign include projects designed to reduce fuel use, emissions and noise, while incorporating more sustainable materials.    For instance, Boeing is collaborating with NASA to produce SMART vortex generators \u2013 small vertical vanes on the wing designed to improve aerodynamic efficiency during takeoff and landing.  Other projects include a system designed to conserve onboard greywater \u2013 water washed into the sink will be used to flush toilets, which also reduces the weight of the aircraft.  The plane will also be used to conduct tests on an \u201cenvironmentally preferred\u201d refrigerant, a new fire suppression agent to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and a heads-up enhanced vision system for pilots to improve operational efficiency.  Meanwhile, Boeing will continue its comprehensive study on the impact of sustainable aviation fuel toward the reduction of emissions.  The aircraft maker says the team plans to power the 777-200ER throughout its test period using a 30/70 blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and conventional jet fuel.    Boeing\u2019s ecoDemonstrator program kicked off a decade ago and takes technologies out of the lab to test them in an operational environment.   It has tested about 230 technologies in total \u201cto help decarbonize aviation, improve operational efficiency and enhance safety and the passenger experience.\u201d   The 2022 ecoDemonstrator plane, bearing the registration number N861BC, was first delivered to Singapore Airlines in 2002, then spent time flying with Air New Zealand and Suriname Airways over its 20-year lifespan.  It has been repainted with an Earth-themed livery, which Boeing says symbolizes a decade of testing to reduce fuel use, emissions and noise.    \u201cBoeing is committed to support our customers and enable the commercial aviation industry to meet our shared commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,\u201d said Stan Deal, Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and CEO, in a statement.  \u201cThe ecoDemonstrator program\u2019s rigorous testing of new technologies further enhances the environmental performance of our products and services and is invaluable to continuously improving safety.\u201d Boeing\u2019s statement says approximately a third of these tested technologies have already been incorporated into its products and services.   The aviation industry has long been pushing to create a more sustainable flying environment in the face of increasing criticisms.  Various reports by industry watchdogs and environmental groups estimate aviation generates 2-3% of global CO2 emissions.    At its annual meeting in October of 2021, IATA, the International Air Transport Association, announced a resolution in support of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. At this year\u2019s IATA AGM, taking place June 19-21 in Doha, Qatar, a \u201cFocus on Sustainability\u201d session will address relevant industry issues including single use plastics, SAFs and the challenges of achieving sustainability \u2013 including net zero carbon emissions by 2050.   Many airlines have already vowed to offer carbon-neutral flights and explore alternative fuels to reduce pollution.  Earlier this month, Spanish airline Air Nostrum announced it\u2019s ordering 10 new hybrid airships. The Airlander 10 aircraft are scheduled to be delivered by 2026. Made by UK-based Hybrid Air Vehicles, the airships could cut emissions by 90%, according to the company.",

            "text": "Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg urged airline executives in a private conversation on Thursday to review their flight schedules and take other steps to soften the impact of summer flight cancellations, according to a source familiar with the call.    The source said Buttigieg asked CEOs on the call to talk through plans to prevent and respond to disruptions over the July 4 holiday weekend and beyond.    The Thursday evening call came on the same day that airlines canceled more than 1,700 flights, according to flight tracking data from FlightAware, largely driven by East Coast thunderstorms.   In this case, there was little airlines could do. Air traffic controllers issued ground stops at six airports, including the three major hubs in greater New York City.   But the disruption rippled into Friday. FlightAware reported that airlines canceled more than 1,250 US flights, many from East Coast airports, as of 3:30 p.m. ET. Special eye on Florida   The call also addressed air travel to and from Florida, a region dense in commercial air travel that has caught officials\u2019 attention.  After carriers raised concerns that the Federal Aviation Administration was not properly staffed for flight numbers, the agency said this week it is \u201cplacing additional air traffic controllers at facilities in Florida to support our long-term strategy of staffing to increased traffic demand.\u201d  Buttigieg thanked the airlines for working with the FAA to improve the situation, including using alternative routes to ease congestion, the source said. Airlines for America, the trade group representing many of the participants, said in a statement that airlines and the Department of Transportation have a \u201cshared commitment to prioritizing the safety and security of all travelers as they reunite with friends, family and colleagues this summer.\u201d    \u201cUS airlines always strive to provide a safe and seamless journey, and recognize the importance of continued partnership between our industry and the federal government to ensure aviation remains the safest mode of transportation in the world.\u201d  More than 2,700 cancellations over the long Memorial Day weekend drew attention to the challenge of rebuilding the air travel system hit hard by the pandemic.  Union criticizes Delta scheduling Delta Air Lines ultimately said it would cancel about 100 flights daily this summer to minimize schedule disruptions.  It told CNN that planners \u201ccontinuously evaluate our staffing models and plan ahead so that we can recover quickly when unforeseen circumstances arise.\u201d    But the union representing Delta pilots launched a protest at an airline business meeting on Thursday and called the airline\u2019s scheduling \u201cunacceptable.\u201d     \u201cWe have been working on our days off, flying a record amount of overtime to help you get to your destination,\u201d Delta\u2019s arm of the Air Line Pilots Association wrote in a message to passengers. \u201cAt the current rate, by this fall, our pilots will have flown more overtime in 2022 than in the entirety of 2018 and 2019 combined, our busiest years to date.\u201d    The union representing Southwest Airlines pilots says the airline scheduled about 200 more flights daily in June than pilots to fly them. CNN has reached out to Southwest for comment.",

            "text": "China on Friday launched its third and most advanced aircraft carrier from Shanghai\u2019s Jiangnan Shipyard, with new combat systems that experts say are fast catching up with the United States. Named \u201cFujian,\u201d the ship is China\u2019s first domestically designed and built catapult aircraft carrier, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. Its electromagnetic catapult-assisted launch system is a major upgrade from the less advanced ski jump-style system used on the Liaoning and the Shandong, its two predecessors, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based think tank. The new system, similar to the ones used by US aircraft carriers, will allow China to launch a wider variety of aircraft from the Fujian faster and with more ammunition. In addition to the launch system, the Fujian is equipped with blocking devices, and a full-load displacement of more than 80,000 tons, Xinhua reported, adding that the ship will carry out mooring tests and navigation tests after the launch. Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the CSIS\u2019s China Project, told CNN previously that the new ship would be the Chinese military\u2019s first modern aircraft carrier. \u201cThis is a pretty significant step forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve really committed to building out a carrier program, and they continue to push the boundaries of what they\u2019re able to do.\u201d China names its aircraft carriers after its coastal provinces, with Liaoning in the northeast and Shandong in the east. Fujian, in the southeast, is the closest province to Taiwan, separated by a strait that is fewer than 80 miles (128 kilometers) wide at its narrowest point. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party claims sovereignty over the self-ruling democracy of Taiwan, despite having never governed it. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has repeatedly said that \u201creunification\u201d between China and Taiwan is inevitable and refused to rule out the use of force.  China now wields the largest naval force in the world, and aircraft carriers are the core vessels of any major power\u2019s fleet. The massive ships are essentially a mobile airbase, allowing for the rapid, long-term deployment of aircraft and weaponry to a combat theater. China\u2019s naval buildup comes amid growing geopolitical tensions with the US, which under President Joe Biden is seeking to strengthen ties with allies and partners in the Asia-Pacific region to counter Beijing\u2019s growing economic influence and military might. Last year, Beijing bristled at a security pact between the US, the UK and Australia named AUKUS, an agreement by which the three nations would exchange military information and technology to form a closer defense partnership in Asia. The naval exercises attended by members of the resuscitated informal dialogue between the US, Japan, Australia and India, known as the Quad, has further unsettled Beijing.  Naval rivalry China\u2019s first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, was an unfinished Soviet-era vessel that Beijing bought from Ukraine in 1998, updated and finally commissioned in 2012. The Chinese military used the technological knowledge it gained from that vessel to build its first domestically constructed carrier, the Shandong, which entered service in December 2019. But although China\u2019s two initial aircraft carriers increased its naval power, their capability was still far behind the US, which has a total of 11 of the vessels in service. In addition, both the Liaoning and the Shandong were based on outdated Soviet technology. Those two carriers used the ski-jump launching system, where planes would simply take off from a slight ramp, while US carriers use a more advanced catapult system to launch their aircraft.  Aircraft launched by catapults can get airborne quicker and with greater quantities of fuel and ammunition, giving them an advantage over planes launched by ski jump, which rely on their own power when lifting off. However, despite the advanced launch system, CSIS\u2019 Funaiole said there are still signs the Chinese carrier lags behind its US counterparts, which have more catapults, a larger airway and more elevators to allow for quicker deployment of aircraft. All US aircraft carriers are also nuclear-powered, while the Fujian is believed to run on conventional steam propulsion, which Funaiole said would limit its reach. \u201c(Although) this may be less of a factor for China right now as many of its interests are in the near seas,\u201d he said. Following its launch, the Fujian will need to be tested and fully outfitted before it is fit to be commissioned and officially enter service. Initially the US Department of Defense had estimated the carrier to be ready for active service by 2023, but it has now pushed that date back to 2024. The Shandong aircraft carrier also took two years from launching in 2017 to when it finally entered service in 2019. Moreover, the Fujian could struggle to operate the electromagnetic launching technology for its catapults. Even the US has had difficulty utilizing the same system on its latest carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, leading to lengthy deployment delays.",

            "text": "The semiconductor industry just can\u2019t catch a break.  After grappling with pandemic-fueled supply bottlenecks, chipmakers are facing a new headache: Russia, one of the world\u2019s biggest suppliers of gases used to make semiconductors, has started to limit exports.  Moscow began restricting exports of inert, or \u201cnoble\u201d gases, including neon, argon and helium to \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries at the end of May, according to a report by Russian state news agency TASS.  All three gases are used to produce the tiny electronic chips found in a raft of consumer products, from smartphones to washing machines to cars, and which have been in critically short supply for months.  It is one of the latest salvos by President Vladimir Putin against countries that have imposed a slew of sanctions on Moscow in response to his assault on Ukraine. Prior to the war, Russia and Ukraine together accounted for about 30% of the chip industry\u2019s supply of neon gas, according to consultancy Bain & Company.   The export limits come just as the semiconductor industry, and its customers, were beginning to shake off the worst of the supply crisis. Last year, carmakers built 10 million fewer vehicles because of the chip shortage, according to LMC Automotive, but supplies were expected to improve in the second half of this year.  \u201cWhat we don\u2019t need, obviously, is another drama with the chip supply that could affect and perhaps stall a recovery,\u201d said Justin Cox, director of global production at the automotive consultancy.  He told CNN Business that neon export limits were \u201cworrying,\u201d but had not taken chipmakers by surprise. After Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine eight years ago, the industry had been preparing for further supply disruptions from the region, he said.  Chipmakers have been preparing   Neon plays a critical role in the production of semiconductors, in a process called lithography. The gas controls the wavelength of light produced by a laser as it etches patterns onto the silicon wafers that make up the chip.  Before the war, Russia collected raw neon as a byproduct in its steelworks, then sent it to Ukraine for purification. The two countries have been leading producers of noble gases since the days of the Soviet Union, when the superpower used them to build its military and space technologies, Jonas Sundqvist, senior technology analyst at Techcet, a market research company, told CNN Business. The conflict has caused lasting damage to capacity. Intense fighting in some of Ukraine\u2019s cities, including Mariupol and Odessa, two strategically important port cities, has destroyed industrial sites and made it extremely difficult to export goods from the region.  \u201cNow we have permanent loss of some purification capability in Mariupol and Odessa,\u201d Sundqvist said. But semiconductor manufacturers have been reducing their dependence on the region ever since Russia invaded Crimea in 2014. Peter Hanbury, a partner at Bain & Company\u2019s manufacturing practice for the Americas, told CNN Business that chip makers have redoubled their efforts in the wake of February\u2019s invasion.  The industry\u2019s dependence on Ukraine and Russia for neon was \u201chistorically very high\u201d at between 80% and 90%, Hanbury said. But since 2014, chipmakers have whittled that down to less than one third.  \u201cThe industry recognized the risk associated with [the region] and began basically qualifying new sources, developing new countries and specific suppliers,\u201d he added.  Price rises It is still too early to know how Russia\u2019s export restrictions will impact semiconductor makers. So far, the war in Ukraine has not impaired production of chips, Hanbury said.  \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see an impact for at least a few months\u2026 I do think that the impact that we see will likely be somewhat minimal,\u201d he said.  However, even if chipmakers can replace lost supply from the region, they are likely to end up paying much more for the vital gases.  It is difficult to track the price of neon and other gases, because most are traded under private long-term contracts, Sundqvist said. But Techcet estimates that neon contract prices have already increased fivefold since the invasion earlier this year, and will remain at those elevated levels in the near-term.  \u201c[Russia\u2019s export limits] will definitely have an impact on any new contracts,\u201d Sundqvist said.  South Korea, home to giant chipmaker Samsung\n            \n                (SSNLF), will feel the pain first, he added, because it is reliant on noble gas imports and \u2014 unlike the United States, Japan and Europe \u2014 lacks big gas companies which could ramp up production.   Samsung overtook Intel\n            \n                (INTC) last year as the biggest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to data compiled by Counterpoint Research.  Micron Technology\n            \n                (MU), another of the world\u2019s biggest chip manufacturers, told CNN Business that it has seen noble gas prices increase, but that it had \u201csufficient supply for the next few months\u201d and does not expect to make any cuts to its production in the short term.  \u201c[We] are taking steps to secure additional supply for a longer period,\u201d a company spokesperson said.  China could benefit Countries are now racing to build up their chipmaking capacity after two years that left them brutally exposed to the volatility of global supply chains.  Intel has offered to help the US government with its plan, and earlier this year announced it would invest $20 billion in two new factories. Last year, Samsung also committed to building a $17 billion facility in Texas.  More chipmaking will likely translate into higher demand for the noble gases. With Russia threatening to curtail its exports, China could be a big beneficiary. It has the \u201cbiggest, newest\u201d production capacity, according to Sundqvist.  Since 2015, the country has poured investment into its own semiconductor industry, including into the equipment needed to separate noble gases from other industrial products. China is now a net exporter of these gases, and claims to be self-reliant, he said.  The world\u2019s demand for noble gases will likely concentrate on China, Sundqvist added, and the county will \u201cget a good price for [its] product.\u201d",

            "text": "As the quest for less environmentally damaging aviation continues, one Spanish airline has thrown its hat into the ring by ordering new hybrid airships \u2013 which pack as much of a punch visually as they are said to do environmentally. Air Nostrum, which operates flights under the Iberia Regional umbrella from its Valencia base, has ordered 10 Airlander 10 aircraft, with delivery scheduled for 2026. Previously, its manufacturers had predicted the aircraft \u2013 which was unveiled in 2016 \u2013 would be in service by 2025. Made by UK-based Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV), the hybrid airships could cut emissions by 90%, according to the company.    Held aloft by helium and powered electricity, they will seat 100 passengers, and typically fly 300-400 kilometers (186-249 miles), according to the manufacturer. Don\u2019t expect a lightning-fast flight, however \u2013 the maximum speed will be 80 mph (129 kph). The deal follows six months of \u201crigorous studies and modeling\u201d of internal Spanish routes, according to the manufacturer.   HAV says that in future, potential short-range routes for the aircraft could include Liverpool to Belfast (168 miles), Seattle to Vancouver (127 miles), and Oslo to Stockholm (263 miles). The aircraft can make point-to-point journeys, since it doesn\u2019t need an airport runway to land \u2013 waterfronts, greenfield sites and underutilized airports have all been earmarked by HAV.   \u201cAirlander doesn\u2019t need airport structure to operate. HAV is exploring novel operating locations with Air Nostrum,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. The interiors are rather more glamorous than typical airplane cabins, with a 1-2-1 configuration, some seats facing each other with, and transparent walls giving views of the countryside below. For those who like to see where they\u2019re going, it will fly at a maximum of 20,000 feet.    Air Nostrum President Carlos Bertomeu said the airships will help his company toward European Union \u201cFit for 55\u201d goals of cutting emissions by at least 55% by 2030.  \u201cThe Airlander 10 will drastically reduce emissions and for that reason we have made this agreement with HAV,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cSustainability\u2026 is already a non-negotiable fact in the daily operations of commercial aviation.  \u201cAgreements such as these are a very effective way to reach the de-carbonization targets contemplated in the Fit for 55 legislative initiative.\u201d HAV CEO Tom Grundy added: \u201cAs countries like France, Denmark, Norway, Spain and the UK begin to put in place ambitious mandates for the decarbonization of domestic and short haul flight, Hybrid Air Vehicles and Air Nostrum Group are demonstrating how we can get there \u2013 and get there soon.    \u201cAirlander is designed to deliver a better future for sustainable aviation services, enable new transport networks and provide rapid growth options for our customers.\u201d HAV will start building the fleet this year, creating 1,800 jobs in Yorkshire, UK. The company said that that it was working on \u201cfurther developments in electric propulsion,\u201d and hope that the Airlander 10 will become the first large scale aircraft to achieve zero-emissions flight.

The prestigious aviation awards, which highlight innovation and creativity in airplane interiors, were announced at a ceremony at the 2022 Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) in Hamburg, Germany. Speaking to CNN Travel at the awards, president of the Crystal Cabin Award Association Lukas Kaestner said a team of industry experts spent a day interrogating each submission before arriving at their decision. Judges debated the creativity and ingenuity of the ideas, and also considered reactions from airlines and potential passengers. Not all of the finalists\u2019 products are on the market, or anywhere near, says Kaestner. Many are still just concepts. But \u201cthe underlying question of most decisions by the jury\u201d is, he explains, \u201cIs it something that has a realistic chance to fly?\u2019  \u2018Floating\u2019 cabin furniture After much discussion, the 24 finalists, already cut down from a lengthy shortlist, were whittled down to eight winners, with Teague and NORDAM\u2019s Elevate cabin design, which visualizes a premium cabin filled with \u201cfloating\u201d seats, taking the top spot in the Cabin Concepts category. Speaking to CNN Travel earlier at AIX, the Teague team explained that the idea behind the concept was to \u201copen up more space\u201d in the cabin, by attaching all the furniture to one track that\u2019s connected to the sidewall and aisle. The idea, said the Teague team, started when airplane designers were chatting over a beer at AIX three years ago. The designers and engineers realized they were all facing the same problem \u2013 how to free up space in airplane cabins without losing seats in the process. They set about dreaming up a solution. Meanwhile, Collins Aerospace\u2019s passenger fridge concept, called SpaceChiller, took home the award in the Passenger Comfort category. The Crystal Cabin jury was intrigued by Collins\u2019 claim that the fridge would use half the power of traditional airplane fridge designs. The fridge\u2019s potential to be scaled up or down, allowing for a mini version to be placed in arm\u2019s reach of a potential passenger, was also a draw for judges. Nominees that missed out on the night included Collins Aerospace\u2019s non-reclining business class seat Airlounge, which premiered on Finnish airline Finnair earlier this year, and Pexco Aerospace\u2019s pandemic-inspired AirShield device, produced in collaboration with Teague, which is designed to enhance airplane air flow, creating an invisible \u201cshield\u201d around individual passengers. Promoting innovation  The Crystal Cabin Awards often sees some of its most innovative submissions crop up in the University category, where the next generation of aviation designers offer up their take on the future of flying. Kaestner told CNN Travel that it\u2019s always intriguing to see where former nominees in this category end up. Some, such as Alejandro Nunez Vicente, nominated in 2021 for his double decker airplane seat, have gone on to found their own start-ups.  This year\u2019s student winner is Ken Kirtland, from the Georgia Institute of Technology, who dreamed up a zero-emission electric aircraft called Portal, that would utilize underused regional airports and fly at lower altitude.  With airplane passengers increasingly clamoring for more sustainable options, and the industry increasingly forced to address the stark realities of their carbon footprint, Kirtland\u2019s design caught the eye of the Crystal Cabin judges. Portal\u2019s eye-catching interiors also played a part in Kirtland\u2019s win \u2013 the idea is that the cabin would feature premium seats dotted around the cabin, with passengers able to enjoy sweeping views of the sky. For Kaestner, the University category sums up what the Crystal Cabin Awards is about. \u201cWe want to foster innovation and just create or fuel the discussion on passenger experience,\u201d he said.

            "text": "Flying economy for any extended period of time is an experience usually endured rather than enjoyed, but one airplane seat designer reckons his design could revolutionize budget travel. Alejandro N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente\u2019s Chaise Longue Airplane Seat concept started small scale last year, as a college project for the then 21-year-old. A nomination in the 2021 Crystal Cabin Awards \u2013 a top prize in the aviation industry \u2013 swiftly followed, and the design became the focus of a flurry of online attention following a CNN Travel article. Since then, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente\u2019s been making waves in the world of aviation. He\u2019s paused his master\u2019s degree to pursue the project full time. He\u2019s in talks with big-name airlines and seat manufacturing companies. He\u2019s been granted some hefty investment that\u2019s allowed the project to develop. But while some marvel at N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente\u2019s innovation, others recoil, concerned about claustrophobia and convinced sitting underneath someone else would be worse, not better, than the current airplane economy set-up. \u201cI grow more from listening to the critics and listening to the bad comments, than from listening to the good comments and the flowers that they throw me,\u201d says N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente, speaking to CNN Travel in Hamburg, Germany, where he\u2019s showcasing his design at the 2022 Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX). His design is for the everyday traveler, so N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente says he\u2019s keen to hear what would-be fliers have to say, positive or negative. \u201cMy purpose here is to change the economy class seats for the better of humanity, or for all the people that cannot afford to pay for more expensive tickets,\u201d he says. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente is set to receive even more feedback this week. AIX is one of the world\u2019s biggest aviation shows, and he\u2019s premiering the first full-scale prototype of his design. CNN Travel stopped by to get a taste of what it might be like to fly on a double decker airplane seat. Testing out the concept  First up, the top level. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente\u2019s designed the prototype with two ladder-like steps for travelers to use to access the top level. It\u2019s a little precarious, but once I\u2019m up there, the seat feels roomy and comfortable, and there\u2019s plenty of room for stretching out my legs. The prototype seats don\u2019t move, but they\u2019re each set up in a different positions to indicate how they could recline. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente\u2019s design does away with the overhead cabin. Instead, he\u2019s designed space in between the top and bottom levels for travelers to stow cabin luggage.  In the vast, echoing halls of the Hamburg Messe conference center, it\u2019s hard to imagine what it would actually be like to be that close to the cabin ceiling. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente reckons there would be about 1.5 meters separating the seated passenger from the top of the plane. He argues that while a traveler couldn\u2019t stand upright in that space, many already can\u2019t stand upright in regular economy rows \u2013 although, presumably, these taller travelers will be even more squished by this design.  Next up, trying the bottom row of seats. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente\u2019s frustration with a lack of legroom was the original impetus for the design, and by not having a seat on the same level in front of me, it does allow me to stretch out my legs, and there\u2019s a foot rest for added comfort. Still, because the other level of seats are directly above me and in my eyeline, it feels pretty claustrophobic. But if you don\u2019t mind tight spaces, and you\u2019re planning simply to sleep all flight, it could be an effective solution. Next steps  The Chaise Longue seat was initially envisaged for the Flying-V airplane, a new airplane concept currently in development at Delft University of Technology, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente\u2019s alma mater. Now, he reckons the design could be implemented in a Boeing 747, Airbus A330 or any other medium to large wide-body airplane. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente is ambitious and confident his design could become a reality, but he also acknowledges that unusual airplane seat ideas don\u2019t often make it from concept to reality. It\u2019s a lengthy process, and the industry\u2019s stringent rules and regulations can become roadblocks.  Plus, the airplane economy seat hasn\u2019t really changed in decades, even if there have been many reimagined concepts floated by designers. \u201cOne of the phrases I get a lot, is \u2018If it\u2019s not broken, why change it?\u2019\u201d admits N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente. \u201cSo if passengers still fly in the worst economy class seats, why are we going to give them a better option? It makes money. That\u2019s the goal of the airline at the end of the day, not to make your flight better.\u201d Still, the seat designer is already working on the next step in his process, to engineer the structure to be lighter than its current iteration. He hopes to partner with an airline or a seat manufacturer to make that happen. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re showing the market what we have. And we\u2019re letting the market come and tell us what we need to do next,\u201d he says. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente might now be collaborating with industry experts with years of experience, but the project began in his bedroom in his parents\u2019 house, and his family remain a big part of the process. He\u2019s at AIX with his parents in tow \u2013 they drove the Chaise Longue prototype in a van across Europe and helped him set up the seat in situ. \u201cOf course, at the beginning, no one expected this to get this big to the point where we are today. But they all knew that I was going to be able to do something,\u201d says N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente. \u201cIf you asked me before, I would have said maybe it\u2019s just a university project. If you asked me now, after all the hard [work], after all the effort of many, many people  \u2013 I would say that now this is more of a reality. We see it as the future of the economy class.\u201d",

            "text": "The fact that the mega rich go to great lengths to customize their private planes to fit their lifestyles is not new.  And we\u2019re not just talking about your average business jet. For decades, world leaders, royalty and billionaires have been fitting out the types of planes most of us fly in commercially, made by the likes of Airbus and Boeing.    But the options on the table are getting increasingly wild.  Among the leaders in the customization game is Germany\u2019s Lufthansa Technik, which recently developed a cabin concept that takes inspiration from another must-have item for the wealthy \u2013 the superyacht.   According to the company, the EXPLORER wide-body VIP cabin concept fulfills two wishes for plane owners: to take their planes almost anywhere at any time, while also serving as a base camp when they travel \u2013 a place to sleep and also enjoy leisure activities and excursions.   Just like a superyacht.   The Lufthansa Technik team picked the Airbus A330 to showcase the concept and has released a series of renderings demonstrating the possibilities.  These include the usual must-haves like bedrooms, bathrooms, bars and dining areas. But the highlight is arguably the retractable veranda \u2013  a floor in the forward fuselage area that can extend outward when the aircraft is parked, sitting at a height of around four meters above the apron.  Coming in a close second is a large-scale integrated projection system for virtual content. It extends from the window belt, reaching up to the ceiling. Customers can select their own lighting and imagery, using a high-tech projecting system to create scenes like green forests and star-filled skies.  The BRABUS Adventure Lounge  The EXPLORER concept was first launched in November 2021, and the company recently presented a new addition at an aviation convention in Geneva in May \u2013 the BRABUS Adventure Lounge. The concept places the lounge in the rear part of the A330\u2019s lower deck, which can be viewed from the main deck through a glass floor. Again, the superyacht, with its garage for tenders and toys, was the inspiration. A selection of vehicles can be stored in the Adventure Lounge for use after landing.  The concept features a limited edition BRABUS 1300 R, created in collaboration with Austrian motorcycle manufacturer KTM.    Wieland Timm, head of sales for VIP and special mission aircraft at Lufthansa Technik, tells CNN Travel via email that the lounge showcases just \u201cone striking example of what this exploration aspect could look like\u201d in flight.  \u201cThe luxury motorcycles are exclusively staged in the accessible lower deck,\u201d he explains. \u201cOnce landed, they can be unloaded and give passengers the freedom to explore the current destination in more detail.\u201d   As for why Lufthansa Technik selected the A330 for the EXPLORER concept, Timm says this classic wide-body aircraft \u201coffers sufficient space for a large number of novel cabin ideas and also a sufficient range to fulfill the special wishes of the EXPLORER target group.\u201d  However, he notes an EXPLORER-type interior could also be installed in other wide-body aircraft such as the Boeing 777.  Who is showing interest?  Timm says the target group for the EXPLORER concept is made up of \u201cthe rather \u2018classic\u2019 ultra-rich individuals traveling and exploring the world in utmost luxury and \u2013 most of all \u2013 privacy, but also charter operators of such high-class luxury travels (offering, for example, 14-day round-the-world trips in a price range from $100,000 to $200,000 per week).\u201d   He says they also expect some owners will be taking a hybrid approach.  \u201cFor example a wealthy individual that owns an EXPLORER aircraft, but uses it only for one month of the year. In the rest of the year, this individual will also charter it out to other operators/users.\u201d    So far, the response has been overwhelmingly positive, he says, noting that they\u2019ve already had inquiries from customers looking to implement one or more of the EXPLORER`s technical gadgets into their current or future cabin completions projects.   He notes that it\u2019s unlikely a plane owner would take on the entire concept as a whole, but given it\u2019s technically feasible, the cabin could be produced as shown. Instead, customers are likely to adapt certain design elements according to their own needs.   \u201cThe simple reason is that the VIP Completions business, especially for wide-body aircraft, is highly individual to match the personal needs of the owner \u2026 The large majority of aircraft we complete for our customers are thus truly unique.\u201d   How close is it to that superyacht experience?  Given superyachts have a lot more freedom in terms of anchoring and mobility, we asked Timm how common it is for owners to stay overnight on their plane while it\u2019s on the ground at an airport.  He says various airports will allow them to park their aircraft and virtually \u201clive\u201d there for a certain amount of time.   \u201cSome of our customers already use this,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe reasons are various and have to do with the fact that these customers often also use the aircraft as their office space and thus receive their customers on-site.  \u201cOthers prefer to stay on the plane overnight for security reasons. In the described EXPLORER use case, however, the airport acts as the home base and starting point for further adventures/explorations.\u201d  ",

            "text": "Tesla shares are about to get three times less expensive. The company announced Friday that its board approved a 3-for-1 stock split, its first split since August 2020.The split would need to be approved by shareholders at the company\u2019s annual meeting in August. Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) closed Friday at a little over $696 per share. If the split were to happen today, its stock would be worth $232 a share. Don\u2019t worry, Tesla stockholders (which is pretty much everyone with a retirement account, these days) \u2013 your stakes will still be worth the same. You\u2019ll be holding three times more shares when all is said and done. Companies split their stocks for numerous reasons: Splits can put their stock within the reach of smaller, individual investors. It helps companies gain liquidity and splits can create more demand for a company\u2019s stock. Although deep-pocketed institutional investors don\u2019t care about the company\u2019s overall stock price, individual investors might be turned off by high-priced shares. The growth of zero-fee trading apps, including Robinhood, E-Trade and others, have made stock splits much more important in recent years. Tesla said it took those factors into consideration \u2013 as well as employees who get paid in company stock.   \u201cWe believe the stock split would help reset the market price of our common stock so that our employees will have more flexibility in managing their equity, all of which, in our view, may help maximize stockholder value,\u201d Tesla said in a regulatory filing Friday. \u201cIn addition, as retail investors have expressed a high level of interest in investing in our stock, we believe the stock split will also make our common stock more accessible to our retail shareholders.\u201d Tesla announced plans for a split in March, but did not announce a ratio. On Friday it noted that its stock has risen 43.5% since its last stock split almost three years ago, although shares have tumbled 30% since it announced those split plans. It may have planned to have a bigger share split had it not fallen so much. This year as Big Tech and the broader market have taken a beating from inflation and higher interest rates. But Tesla, in particular, has struggled this year in part because of CEO Elon Musk\u2019s attempt to leverage his massive Tesla stake to purchase Twitter. He even sold $8.5 billion worth of Tesla shares to raise cash to be used towards the purchase, which helped put downward pressure on Tesla share price. Other Big Tech companies also have recently announced stock splits to help boost their affordability and attractiveness to everyday investors. Amazon\u2019s\n            \n                (AMZN) 20-for-1 stock split went into effect Monday. Alphabet, which owns Google\n            \n                (GOOGL), also approved a 20-for-1 split that will take effect in July. Online retailer Shopify\n            \n                (SHOP) has a 10-for-1 stock split planned for later in June, while meme stock darling GameStop proposed splitting its stock as well. Tesla\u2019s move may also be aimed at getting it included in the famed Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tends to include less expensive stocks. Apple\n            \n                (AAPL), for example, announced a 7-for-1 stock split in 2014 and got included in the Dow in 2015. The split is no guarantee that it will be included in the Dow, but the index may want the world\u2019s most valuable car company and a pioneer in electric vehicles. Shares of Tesla rose 1% in extended trading. Tesla also announced that Larry Ellison, the chairman of Oracle\n            \n                (ORCL) had decided to leave the board. Ellison has been on the Tesla board since December 2018. Major company stock splits have become very in vogue in recent years. But one company with an alarmingly high stock price has never split and said it never would: Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKA). At $439,780 a share, Berkshire shares are unapproachable for most individual investors. That\u2019s why it offers its B-class shares\n            \n                (BRKB), which have split in the past, for just under $292.",

Unfortunately for investors, analysts at Goldman Sachs see more pain ahead for some (but not all) tech heavyweights. Goldman Sachs analysts downgraded shares of Netflix\n            \n                (NFLX), eBay\n            \n                (EBAY) and gaming/metaverse giant Roblox to rare \u201csell\u201d ratings on Thursday. The Goldman Sachs analysts had previously rated these stocks with a lukewarm \u201cneutral.\u201d The analysts said the downgrades were done after they decided \u201cto incorporate a greater probability of a weaker macro environment and solidly lower revenue growth\u2026to reflect broader industry maturation.\u201d  In other words, rate hikes, increased competition and the fact that consumers are less worried about Covid and leaving their homes more often instead of sheltering in place are catching up to Netflix, Roblox and eBay. Shares of Netflix and eBay both tumbled 5% Friday while Roblox fell 9%. The Goldman Sachs analysts said they downgraded Netflix due to \u201cconcerns around the impact of a consumer recession as well as heightened levels of competition.\u201d They said Netflix is now a \u201cshow-me story.\u201d There are growing worries that cash-strapped consumers may find that they are now paying for too many streaming service and need to cut back.  Netflix is no longer the only streaming game in town, as Disney\n            \n                (DIS), Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN), Apple\n            \n                (AAPL), Paramount, Comcast\n            \n                (CMCSA) and CNN owner Warner Bros. Discovery all have their own services with exclusive content. Goldman Sachs seems less worried about competition for Roblox, saying it is still \u201cthe best positioned company in the gaming/interactive entertainment\u201d business and has good \u201clong-term secular growth opportunities.\u201d  But there are \u201cincreasing concerns around the post-pandemic environment\u201d for Roblox. The Goldman analysts expect \u201cslowing growth\u201d in the near term. As for eBay, the Goldman Sachs analysts noted that \u201cwith the global consumer environment under pressure and eCommerce growth slowing in a post-pandemic world, we see eBay\u2019s\u2026revenue growth at risk, [especially] given its overexposure to international markets.\u201d The Goldman Sachs analysts also reiterated their \u201csell\u201d rating on another big tech firm: Airbnb. The analysts slashed their target price on Airbnb from $150 to $95. The stock currently trades at about $110. The analysts said that even though \u201cpent-up travel demand\u2026remains a tailwind,\u201d there are concerns about a recession, the stock\u2019s valuation and the possibility of \u201cpotential normalization of consumer travel habits\u201d leading to more people staying at hotels as opposed to renting homes when they go on vacation.

            "text": "The first shipments from the federal government\u2019s Operation Fly Formula will bring a total of nearly 1 million pounds of baby formula powder into the United States. That\u2019s just a fraction of what the nation\u2019s families need \u2013 about the same amount of formula typically sold over two days in the US \u2013 but it is a jump-start to easing the shortage.   According to the White House, the first two Operation Fly Formula flights brought in 170,000 pounds of Gerber and Alfamino formulas. Subsequent announcements have included 300,000 pounds of two kinds of formula manufactured in the UK by Kendamil, 380,000 pounds of Bubs brand infant formula from Australia and 110,000 pounds of a formula made in Germany by Nestle called Nan Supreme Pro. Taken together, that\u2019s 960,000 pounds of infant formula, enough to make 11.4 million 8-ounce bottles.    That\u2019s a sizable amount, but how far will that formula really go toward filling America\u2019s bare store shelves?   One way to answer that question is to look at the volume of dry formula that\u2019s typically sold each month in the US. According to the market research firm Information Resources Incorporated, or IRI, an average of about 561,000 pounds of dry powder formula was sold each day in 2021, or about 17 million pounds each month.    The 960,000 pounds coming in through the Operation Fly Formula shipments accounts for about two days\u2019 worth of typical formula sales or about 6% of the powdered formula sold in an average month in 2020 and 2021, according to a CNN analysis. CNN looked back at those years because they represent more typical consumption in a very stable market, before a nationwide formula recall worsened supply chain problems and led to an acute shortage in early 2022.    IRI data is often cited by the White House as a measure of the severity of the shortage. Its data shows that about 26% of formula products were out of stock in the last week of May, up from 10% before the recall.      A White House spokesperson said that CNN\u2019s analysis is \u201cin the ballpark\u201d but that the missions announced so far are \u201conly a small portion\u201d of the commitments made. More flights are \u201con the way and more to be announced,\u201d which would bring in 10 times more formula \u2013 enough to make a total of 127.5 million bottles. On Friday, a day after CNN shared this analysis, the White House announced the latest mission that\u2019s slated to bring an additional 212,000 pounds of formula into the US by the end of the month. IRI did not want to comment on the White House activities specifically but agreed that the analysis was accurate. It noted that, for most products, adding 6% of product into the mix can help ease tension in a strained market.   Also, IRI\u2019s sales data represents national figures, and the Operation Fly Formula deliveries may have more of an impact in certain places, especially for those who need specialty formula.   Other experts agree.    \u201cIt will make a noticeable difference,\u201d said Dr. Steve Abrams, immediate past chair of the American Association of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition.   Abrams says Abbott Nutrition\u2019s Sturgis, Michigan, factory once churned out between 15% and 20% of all the baby formula produced in the US.      That facility reopened about a week ago after closing to remedy safety problems identified by a US Food and Drug Administration inspection. Abbott has said it will focus initial production on making the specialty formula EleCare, an amino-acid based formula for babies and children with complex medical and digestive issues. It will start distributing EleCare around June 20, but powdered Similac will take weeks longer to come back.  \u201cWe\u2019re also working hard to fulfill the steps necessary to restart production of Similac and other formulas and will do so as soon as we can,\u201d the company said Saturday. In the meantime, the FDA is using its enforcement discretion to allow more international manufacturers to sell their baby formula in this country.     Abrams says that although just three international manufacturers have gotten an OK from the FDA to sell new-to-the-US products here, he has heard that several dozen companies have requested clearance. So he expects that more products will soon be on the way.   But beyond the sheer numbers, Abrams says, appearances will be important. Because these formula brands haven\u2019t been seen in the US before, he thinks people are really going to take notice when they arrive \u2013 a solid sign that help is on the way.    \u201cWhen these formulas hit the stores, I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of easing up on hoarding and stressing,\u201d said Abrams, who is also a neonatologist at the University of Texas Dell Medical School. \u201cI think that there\u2019s going to be this big hurrah when people can go to Target and see formula again. So that effect may exceed the volume amount.\u201d    Some of that formula arrived Thursday. Nestle says 62,500 cans of Nan Supreme Pro 1 will be sold through the websites of Gerber, Walmart, Kroger and Amazon within a few days of arrival.  The company says it will sell the product online only so it can give parents and caregivers important instructions on how to use it.  ",

Did you know there are actually two Air Force Ones? (Should that be Airs Force One?) It\u2019s true \u2014 POTUS gets two planes, and technically Air Force One is designated as whichever jet the president is flying on. More fun facts: Boeing was due to deliver two new presidential 747s soon, but they are wildly over budget and behind schedule. On top of all of that, there\u2019s a new headache: The paint job that former President Donald Trump ordered is a major liability. Trump didn\u2019t love the AF1 color scheme, with its light blue stripe that\u2019s been there since the Kennedy administration. He wanted a supposedly more patriotic look, with a red, white and blue palette. In case the state-of-art tech and armada of nuclear-attack-resistant support planes didn\u2019t do enough to scream \u201cTHIS IS AMERICA.\u201d But it turns out the darker blue Trump requested could potentially overheat the sophisticated electronics system that ensures POTUS can stay in secure communication with officials on the ground. The Air Force did not say what the new color scheme would be. And there was no word yet from Trump about how quickly he\u2019d order the military to revert to his design if he\u2019s re-elected\u2026 NUMBER OF THE DAY $4,000 New York, New York, it\u2019s a helluva town. The rent is up and our wages are down \u2026 Ah, New York City. We love you. We really do. But you don\u2019t make it easy. Rents just a record high in May \u2014 the fourth consecutive month of records \u2014 as landlords jacked up prices and revoked pandemic-era concessions. Median rent for an apartment in Manhattan hit $4,000 a month in May, surging 25% from a year ago, according to a report from brokerage firm Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers and Consultants. VALLEY NEWS The \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d ethos in Silicon Valley isn\u2019t aging well.  These days it\u2019s more \u201ccut costs and try to survive.\u201d Here\u2019s the thing: Big Tech has been barreling toward a reckoning for a few years, but 2022 has accelerated the industry\u2019s reality check. Tech stocks are now in their worst rout in a decade, starved of the easy money from the Fed\u2019s pandemic-era stimulus program that fueled those companies\u2019 recent highs. Companies are laying off staff.   As my colleague Catherine Thorbecke writes, investors and industry vets have been sounding the alarm for weeks. Virtually every sector, minus energy and utility stocks, is struggling with high inflation, rising interest rates and general gloominess that has economists and analysts speculating about a recession. But tech \u2014 along with other high-risk investments like SPACs and cryptocurrencies \u2014 has been hit especially hard. Even tech giants like Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (the so-called FAANG stocks) are down by double digits, faring worse than the broader market. It\u2019s enough to remind more seasoned investors of the 2000 Dot-Com Bubble. \u201cFor years, startups generally followed the same playbook, which was grow as fast as possible at whatever the burn rate,\u201d says Matt Kennedy, the senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of pre-IPO research and IPO-focused ETFs. \u201cThat\u2019s what their investors wanted to see. Capital was cheap, so losses didn\u2019t matter.\u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s changed. Once again, profits matter,\u201d he added.  While many comparisons have been made to the anguish wrought by the burst of the Dot-Com bubble, Catherine explains, the tech sector is far more developed now than it was in the past.  \u201cLarge tech companies, even though they\u2019re tightening their belts, are still in a financially advantageous position,\u201d said Dan Wang, an associate professor at Columbia Business School. And unlike 2000, Big Tech\u2019s products are indispensable \u2014 consider the phone or laptop you\u2019re reading this on right now.   Enjoying Nightcap?

            "text": "Shares in Chinese tech companies have surged this week on hopes that Beijing is close to ending a yearlong regulatory crackdown on the industry.  Alibaba\n            \n                (BABA) was up 1.9% on Tuesday, following a 5% gain on Monday. JD.com\n            \n                (JD) climbed 3%, after rising 4.7% the previous day.  Other tech shares have also gained sharply since Monday. TikTok\u2019s rival Kuaishou advanced 1.2% on Tuesday, adding to a 5.1% increase in the prior session. Food delivery service Meituan increased 0.5% on Tuesday and is up 10% so far this week. The gains followed a strong session for Chinese stocks on Wall Street on Monday, when the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index soared 5.4%.  Didi was the top gainer in New York, jumping as much as 67%, after The Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing\u2019s cybersecurity review of the ride-hailing giant was about to wrap up. The move would allow Didi to return to app stores in mainland China, potentially as soon as this week.  \u201cThe headline sparked speculation that Beijing was ending the crackdown on the platform economy to support growth given mounting downside pressure on China growth,\u201d said Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign exchange strategist for Mizuho Bank. However, it would take time to repair business confidence, he added. China\u2019s economic outlook has deteriorated rapidly in recent months amid widespread Covid-related lockdowns. Consumer spending and factory output both shrank sharply in April, while unemployment surged to the highest level since the initial coronavirus outbreak in early 2020. Concerned about the worsening outlook, Beijing has signaled that it will relax its yearlong crackdown on the tech sector \u2014 long a key growth driver and the main source of well-paid employment. In recent weeks, top government officials have tried to lift the spirits of the internet industry and pledged to support tech companies that seek to list in overseas markets. Authorities have also unveiled a new package of 33 stimulus measures to shore up growth post Covid, including tens of billions of dollars of additional tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Key cities like Beijing and Shanghai have gradually reopened and lifted Covid restrictions, with daily life starting to return to normal. Chinese equities are pricing in \u201cthe worst is over\u201d as China reopens its economy, said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Oanda. The benchmark Shanghai Composite edged up 0.2% on Tuesday, poised for a third straight day of gains. It rose 1.3% on Monday. The large-cap CSI 300 was up 0.4%, following a 1.9% advance on Monday.  Hong Kong\u2019s benchmark Hang Seng\n            \n                (HSI) Index, meanwhile, retreated slightly after rising 2.7% in the previous day.",

            "text": "For many average investors, the price of just one Amazon share has been prohibitively expensive. There are a lot of things a person can spend about $2,500 on instead of one tiny piece of \u201cPrime\u201d stock market real estate. A nice vacation? That home entertainment system? Season tickets for your favorite sports team?  That\u2019s about to change.  Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN) is doing what\u2019s known as a stock split, which increases the number of shares outstanding that a company has and also lowers its stock price, making it more affordable for the average investor. The split, which takes effect Monday, will be a 20-for-1 transaction, meaning that if you owned one share of Amazon, you\u2019ll wind up with 20 shares after the split that each cost about 1/20th of the previous price. So the value of your investment does not change, and one Amazon share that traded for just under $2,450 would become 20 shares that each cost a little more than $120. Why is Amazon doing this now? Companies with sky-high stock prices often announce splits in order to make shares seem more affordable to retail investors. Google and YouTube owner Alphabet\n            \n                (GOOGL), which trades at a price of more than $2,300 and has a market cap of nearly $1.5 trillion, also has approved a 20-1 split that will occur in July. Online retailer Shopify\n            \n                (SHOP) has a 10-for-1 stock split planned for later in June, while Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) and meme stock darling GameStop\n            \n                (GME) have proposed splitting their stocks as well. But here\u2019s the thing: Even though a stock split may make it seem like a share is now more affordable, it doesn\u2019t actually make the stock any cheaper when looking at valuation measures like price-to-earnings or price-to-sales ratios.  Amazon will still be worth about $1.3 trillion after the split takes place. The stock will still be trading for more than 150 times earnings forecasts for this year and nearly 2.5 times its estimated 2022 sales \u2013 ratios that are significantly higher than the broader stock market as well as other retail industry leaders like Walmart\n            \n                (WMT) and Target\n            \n                (TGT). Many individual investors who have wanted to own growth stocks like Amazon, Google and Tesla were often forced to buy fractional shares (i.e. pieces of one stock) or get exposure to these companies through popular exchange-traded index funds like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF or Invesco QQQ ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100. That\u2019s why making the share prices of quadruple-digit stocks more accessible is a \u201csmart move,\u201d according to Michael Mullaney, director of global markets research for Boston Partners. This should allow more investors to buy so-called round lots (100 shares) of a company instead of just a handful of shares.   \u201cRetail investor trading has increased dramatically over the past year and a half and has become very important again. It\u2019s not just big institutions and hedge funds,\u201d Mullaney said. \u201cBut it\u2019s impossible for an average investor to buy 100 shares of some of these stocks at these prices.\u201d  Professional investors have taken notice, too.  Amazon\u2019s stock has rallied nearly 6% in the past week, as some traders might be looking to buy before the split takes effect. (Amazon is still down more than 25% this year.) Stock splits for Amazon and Alphabet could serve another purpose as well: it may increase the chances of both companies eventually being added to the Dow.  That prestigious group of 30 leading American companies is a price weighted instead of a market cap weighted index. So at their current share prices, Amazon and Alphabet could not be added to the Dow without having an outsized impact on the daily moves of the index.  UnitedHealth\n            \n                (UNH), which trades for just under $500 a share currently has the biggest weighting in the Dow, followed by Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) and Home Depot\n            \n                (HD), which each trade for more than $300. Its high stock price was one of the main reasons why Apple\n            \n                (AAPL) wasn\u2019t added to the Dow until 2015, several months after a stock split pushed its price from the high triple digits to below $100 a share. So the looming splits for Amazon and Alphabet could pave the way for those tech titans to join Apple and Microsoft, the only two companies in the US with a higher market value than Amazon and Alphabet, in the Dow.  Inflation finally peaking? Big tech stocks aren\u2019t the only things with inflated prices. Consumers and businesses have been dealing with rising prices of commodities and services for the better part of the past year. Investors will get another look at just how high prices have surged when the US government releases its latest consumer price index (CPI) figures on Friday.  Prices rose 8.3% over the past 12 months ending in April. But that increase, while still stubbornly high, was the first drop in year-over-year consumer inflation since August. Consumer prices were up 8.5% in the 12 months that ended in March. So economists are hoping the level of price increases will continue to taper off over the next few months.  Even so, it may take some time for consumer prices to get to a level that\u2019s more comfortable for shoppers \u2026 and the Fed. The Fed ideally would like to see CPI slow to about a 3% to 3.5% clip, if not lower, before declaring a victory against inflation. \u201cThe good news is that inflation numbers should start to come down,\u201d said Ken Shinoda, a portfolio manager with DoubleLine. \u201cThe question is will they come down enough?\u201d Up next Monday: Amazon stock split.

            "text": "A US judge approved the seizure of two of Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich\u2019s private planes, valued at more than $400 million, for violating US export and sanctions laws. The planes, a Gulfstream and a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, which is believed to be one of the most expensive private planes in the world, are in Russia and Dubai, according to an FBI agent\u2019s affidavit to support the seizure warrant. The Commerce Department also announced administrative charges against Abramovich. If he\u2019s found liable, the maximum penalty could be as much as the value of the planes, an administration official said. The US actions are part of an effort to punish Russians known to be close to the Kremlin and apply pressure to Moscow\u2019s economy to try to end the invasion of Ukraine. While Abramovich has not been sanctioned by the US Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, a Justice Department official said the seizure warrant indicates that \u201cno one is above the law and not being on OFAC\u2019s list doesn\u2019t give you a license to evade sanctions or export controls.\u201d Authorities say the American-made planes were flown into and out of Russia without obtaining licenses from the US Commerce Department. Airplanes and aircraft parts are subject to export rules because of their potential military use and national security implications. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February the Commerce Department tightened sanctions and began requiring licenses for the export of planes, which didn\u2019t previously need approval. By early March, Commerce also prohibited an American plane owned by a Russian national from being exported to Russia. In an unusual move, the seizure warrant was made public and not filed under seal. The Justice Department official said the filing was public to reveal the names of shell companies the US believes were used to shield the actual ownership and to encourage dialogue with banks, insurance companies and others to cooperate. The official said it was also intended to send a message to anyone who helps those sanctioned or accused of violating US laws that they run \u201cthe risk of being viewed as obstructionists.\u201d In the affidavit, the FBI agent outlined four layers of shell companies he had unraveled to trace the aircraft to Abramovich. The filing indicated that the FBI had located documents used to set up the companies offshore, in jurisdictions outside of the US\u2019 control and beyond their subpoena power. Those documents indicated that Abramovich was the owner of the companies that had purchased the jets. Authorities say that in mid-March the Gulfstream jet flew to Russia twice, where it remains. In early March the Boeing aircraft flew from Dubai to Russia and back to Dubai, where it remains. The Boeing, originally bought for $93.6 million, was customized and is now valued at about $350 million, according to the FBI affidavit. Andrew Adams, the head of the US\u2019 KleptoCapture task force, which has seized two luxury yachts and bank accounts, previously told CNN that they are taking a broad look at the laws they can apply and the types of assets they can seize, no matter where they are located. \u201cThese seizures are, are going to continue apace, and people recognize that where the seizures are happening around the world are in pockets of the world that might not have been expected,\u201d he previously said, adding, \u201cThere are no safe havens.\u201d",

JetBlue Chief Executive Robin Hayes told CNBC that the airline had made \u201cunprecedented divestiture commitments\u201d to win regulatory approval.  \u201cWe know what it takes to get this deal done,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cWe need the Spirit board to seriously consider our offer.\u201d In the latest revised offer, JetBlue did not offer to unwind its \u201cNortheast Alliance\u201d (NEA) partnership with American Airlines\n            \n                (AAL) \u2013 a key sticking point in its deal talks with Spirit, which has been reluctant to consider any offer from JetBlue due to antitrust concerns. The NEA is already in the crosshairs of the Justice Department, which sued JetBlue in September to unwind the partnership. The latest offer from JetBlue, however, might put pressure on Spirit\u2019s board to consider a deal with them, especially if shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholders Services and Glass Lewis choose to side with the latest JetBlue offer, experts said.  It remains to be seen whether Spirit finally decides to engage with JetBlue. Spirit is still committed to its deal with Frontier, the sources said, but may be forced to switch sides if they face mounting pressure from large institutional shareholders. Spirit had rejected JetBlue\u2019s offer last month saying it had a low likelihood of winning approval from government regulators.  On Monday, JetBlue raised its reverse break-up fee by $150 million to $350 million, which is payable to Spirit shareholders in case the deal falls through due to antitrust reasons. Frontier had agreed to pay $250 million in break-up fees. Last week, proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis recommended that Spirit Airlines investors approve the deal with Frontier Group after another proxy firm, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc, advised against it. The new JetBlue offer will trigger ISS and Glass Lewis opinion revisions on the Frontier deal, the sources added.",

            "text": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says an economic hurricane is coming. Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk says he has a \u201csuper bad feeling\u201d about a recession. Companies are downgrading their earnings forecasts. Oh, and we\u2019re in the midst of an energy and inflation crisis, and stocks have been flirting with a bear market. It\u2019s easy to feel miserable about the economy. And it turns out most Americans do: Only 23% of the US public say economic conditions are \u201csomewhat good\u201d or better, a recent CNN Poll conducted by SSRS found. And yet those same Americans keep spending like crazy \u2014 because nearly everyone has a job. We just got another pretty robust jobs report Friday: America added another 390,000 jobs in May. To put that in context, that\u2019s more than double the average 186,000 jobs the US economy was creating each month during President Donald Trump\u2019s administration before the pandemic \u2014 you know, just a few years ago, when Americans were super jazzed about the economy. So who\u2019s right? The Fed is slamming the brakes If you\u2019re feeling like the US economy is slowing down, you\u2019re not alone. In fact, that slowdown is intentional. The Federal Reserve had been giving the economy a sugar rush since March 2020 by buying billions of dollars of government bonds and corporate debt each month and by keeping rates near zero for two years.  The economy got high on the Fed\u2019s supply, and inflation zoomed to a four-decade high. In March 2022, Fed Chair Jerome Powell finally said, \u201cno m\u00e1s,\u201d and the central bank raised rates. In May, the Fed issued the biggest rate hike in more than 20 years, and it pledged that the beatings would continue until morale improves. A steady stream of historically large rate hikes and a rapid downsizing of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet should help cure the economy\u2019s addiction to free money: By slowing the economy, the Fed hopes to tame inflation. But it could also plunge the economy into a recession. Strong dollar hurts multinationals I know what you\u2019re thinking: What does this mean for giant megacorporations with big, global footprints? Well, Timmy, it\u2019s not great news. Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT) this week downgraded its earnings and sales forecasts for this quarter because the dollar is so strong. Yup, now we have another thing to worry about: Thanks to the Fed, your money may be worth too much.  Rate hikes help boost the value of the dollar, which is near parity with the euro for the first time in two decades. That\u2019s good news if you\u2019re doing some international travel and bad news if you\u2019re a giant American company that makes money overseas (Microsoft brings in just under half of its revenue from foreign countries), because the widgets you sell abroad will suddenly cost more for your customers compared to the widgets you sell in the good ol\u2019 U.S. of A. Before you say, \u201cStick it to the man!\u201d remember those companies pay a lot of people a lot of money, who go spend it, etc. etc. You took Econ 101. The point is: It\u2019s another thing that\u2019s not super great for the economy. The economy may be correcting itself The Fed isn\u2019t alone in helping slow down the economy. Inflation is starting to wear on consumers and retailers. Walmart\n            \n                (WMT), Target\n            \n                (TGT) and a bunch of other big stores said last month that customers are downsizing their purchases, focusing on necessities. Retailers have been downgrading their profit outlooks as they anticipate those clouds on the horizon will get closer and darker. America\u2019s electric housing market is showing signs of running out of sparks, too: Mortgage rates are massively higher than they were just a year ago (OK, that\u2019s also kinda the Fed\u2019s fault), driving some prospective homebuyers out of the market. Sales of existing homes in the United States fell for the third-consecutive month in April. Job growth is also starting to slow just a bit. Although adding nearly 400,000 jobs in a month is great, historically it\u2019s less than the 450,000 to 650,000 jobs America was adding each month last year. May\u2019s jobs total marked the lowest since April 2021. And we still haven\u2019t made up for all the jobs lost in the early days of the pandemic. As the economy continues to bridge that gap, the pace of hiring may slow, because we\u2019re reaching full employment and the job market is naturally running out of steam. Meanwhile, inflation itself is cooling somewhat. Consumer prices were still 8.3% higher in April 2022 than they were in April 2021, but, hey, that\u2019s less than the 8.5% annual inflation rate in March! So that\u2019s something. All that other stuff The problem with the theory that a slowing economy may tame inflation is that government stimulus (both those sweet, sweet stimmy checks and the Fed\u2019s monetary policy) is not solely responsible for the mess we\u2019re in. Russia is turning off the gas in some European countries while Europe looks to move beyond Russian oil. That has created some energy shortages, sending prices through the roof. The Fed can\u2019t do anything about that unless it\u2019s sitting on an oil well (narrator voice: It isn\u2019t). Russia\u2019s continued invasion of Ukraine has sent commodity prices soaring, creating a global food crisis. Meanwhile, China has been locking down its major cities to prevent the spread of Covid, turning the world\u2019s second-largest economy southward and exacerbating shortages that have helped drive prices of just about everything higher. And America\u2019s labor shortage continues to boost wages and has made goods shortages even more worse\u2026er. Suffice it to say, those are problems with no easy solutions. So what are those doomsayers talking about? None of this is great news. At the same time, a natural slowdown is fine, if not welcome. The economy has a fever, and the only prescriptions are more rate hikes and more cowbell, in that order. RSM\u2019s Joe Brusuelas said he was encouraged by Friday\u2019s jobs report for showing signs of economic cooling. And Aneta Markowska of Jefferies told CNN even more contracting would be needed to tame inflation, because wages keep rising, fueling more inflation. So why all the doom and gloom? The economic naysayers seem to be hinting at the same thing: We could face a dire situation down the road if we don\u2019t take the correct actions to prevent it. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh on Friday told CNN there is \u201cno question\u201d a rough economic period is possible and said action must be taken \u201cstep by step.\u201d Dimon said an economic \u201churricane\u201d is coming \u2013 but the question remains whether it would be a rainstorm or a super storm.  As my colleague Julia Horowitz noted in her Before the Bell newsletter Friday: The data is messy, and we\u2019re relying on the Federal Reserve, which has limited ability to control the causes of inflation and a miserable reputation of predicting when to stop raising rates before it plunges the economy into a recession. Or, in my less elegant words: The economy may be heading down the toilet, and we can only pray no one flushes it. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Matt Egan contributed to this report.",

            "text": "You might not know that the standard for today\u2019s airline seat sizing goes all the way back to 1954.  That\u2019s when Boeing first flew the prototype that would lead to the jet age\u2019s iconic 707.  As Boeing developed its aircraft families, it reused core elements like the fuselage, even as it developed new wings and engines.  For instance, the 727 was essentially a 707 but with the engines at the back. The 737 \u2013 still manufactured today \u2013\u00a0was and is essentially a 707 but with two engines instead of four. The 707\u2019s seats, arranged with six in each row in \u201ctourist\u201d or \u201ccoach,\u201d as economy used to be called, were pretty good for 1954, but that was nearly 70 years ago.   You might not know a lot of people who were adults in 1954, but if you do, make the most of their impressive longevity and compare their general size and stature next to a strapping, well-nourished 18-year-old of today.  All things being equal, you\u2019ll probably note that people these days are quite a bit bigger \u2013\u00a0taller, with wider shoulders and wider hips. But the Boeing 737 \u2013 which has a fuselage width of 148 inches (3.76 meters), just like the 707s \u2013 still seats six people in every row.  No wonder planes seem more cramped today, even the slightly wider Airbus A320s, which tends to offer an 18\u201d seat, or the A220 (designed by Bombardier as the C Series), which offers 19\u201d.   But what if these single-aisle airplanes were just, well, bigger? That\u2019s a question that aviation interior consultancy LIFT Aero Design is asking with a concept called Paradym.  Managing Director Daniel Baron and design partner Aaron Yong are refreshingly open that Paradym really does need a new paradigm: wider planes. \u201cParadym is a configuration concept for the next generation of single-aisle aircraft,\u201d Baron tells CNN.  \u201cIt adopts a higher standard of comfort in economy class using wide triple seats. What\u2019s totally different is the idea of a new single-aisle aircraft that is considerably wider than today\u2019s 737 or A320 families.  \u201cEvery row in Paradym would have wide triple seats, with 20 inches between armrests instead of the current 17-18. Every row would also have two armrests between seats instead of one.\u201d The concept would allow airlines to modify these three seats to offer different levels of service according to demand, including economy and premium economy. There is a lie-flat option as well.   Changing traveler needs LIFT is asking the question at a particularly pivotal time, particularly for the narrowbody single-aisle aircraft that make up most of the world\u2019s short-to-medium-haul fleet, and a small but growing part of its long-haul services. Boeing has stretched the 1960s airframe of the Boeing 737 as far as it can with the 737 MAX. Airbus is getting that way with the A320neo evolution of the 1980s\u2019 A320. Add that to the opportunities for hydrogen power, and it seems likely that both airplane makers will need to build a fully new plane for their next narrowbody.  Now is the time to talk about making that plane a bit wider. \u201cThe simple fact is that in the age of rising airfares, work-from-home-forever and the incoming metaverse revolution, airlines will need to reinvent themselves to stay relevant,\u201d Baron argues.   \u201cSpace in long-haul economy class has been shrinking as more space is allocated to premium classes for increasingly luxurious seats. And throughout the world, humans are getting larger in every direction. The seat width standards of yesterday may no longer be sufficient to keep frequent long haul flying attractive, especially with ultra long-haul flights now stretching 16-20 hours.\u201d  Covid-19, too, has changed the way that many people perceive their own personal \u201cbubble\u201d of space, while rising rates of onboard disruption from unruly passengers seem likely linked to the fact that seat rows are, by and large, a few inches closer to each other than they were in previous years, and that there are more seats in each row. When the Boeing 777 first started flying in the 1990s, almost all mainline airlines put nine economy seats in each row. Today, almost all of them have 10. When Boeing designed the 787 Dreamliner in the 2000s, it advertised a comfortable eight-abreast seating standard and a nine-abreast option for low cost carriers \u2013\u00a0but, in reality, only Japan Airlines took the eight-abreast seating. From an airline accountant\u2019s point of view, this makes sense. The received wisdom in the aviation industry \u2013\u00a0and the ongoing success of low-cost carriers \u2013\u00a0is that any comfort qualms are settled by cheaper ticket prices, and that very few passengers choose their flight on anything other than price and schedule. \u2018A cabin with no curtains or dividers\u2019 Airlines, Baron explains, \u201chave access to highly sophisticated revenue management software to adjust fares, but at the end of the day, cannot physically adjust seats in multi-class aircraft to meet ever-fluctuating demand.\u201d  Some have tried, like with the kind of convertible seat previously used by some European carriers to create a wider berth for their middle-seat-free-economy Eurobusiness-style seating, but this has now largely been removed.  \u201cMoving forward,\u201d Baron says, \u201cfor airlines the key to sustainable profitability will be the ability to tailor the entire experience to customer needs.\u201d These can change even for the same person between trips: a road warrior has different needs if she is on a one-hour day flight to Omaha alone versus with her family flying eight hours overnight to Europe on vacation.  \u201cWe already see a trend toward product unbundling,\u201d LIFT\u2019s Aaron Yong says, referring to airlines selling individual mini-upgrade products like extra legroom seats, better meals, lounge access, more luggage, and so on.   \u201cIn the future, demand for flexibility in seat product and inflight service options will only rise. In this context, the primary advantage of Paradym for airlines is the ability to sell multiple products with a single seat model throughout the aircraft. Customers would be able to book any experience on offer by the airline, with the airline able to continually tweak in order to optimize revenue generation for the flight, using every row in the aircraft, until departure.\u201d \u201cParadym envisions a cabin with no curtains or dividers,\u201d Yong explains, comparing triple seat sets to sets of four seats, or quads.  \u201cThe concept of traditional classes is replaced by products. The airline could sell any row from nose to tail as economy, premium economy and/or a lie flat product ie, the customer purchases three seats and gets a wide sleeping surface nearly as long as a quad. It could be combined with premium food, IFE and amenities and sold as\u00a0\u2018premium economy flat\u2019, a brand new product category.\u201d That might not be for the famous names with their firmly established brands and well-known brands: Delta One, United Polaris, British Airways Club World, and so on.  But new airlines start up all the time, and often the old guard realizes that there can be real benefits to the new crowd\u2019s way of doing things.  Is that enough, though, for a Paradym shift?",

            "title": "This Italian airline just got a sassy new look",
            "text": "When it launched in October 2021, ITA Airways, Italy\u2019s new national carrier, promised to bring a \u201c100% Italian experience\u201d to the skies.  And now, nearly eight months later, the airline has unveiled its new look, including new uniforms and food planned by Italian celebrity chefs. The new look was unveiled alongside ITA\u2019s three new long-haul Airbus A350-900s \u2013 the plane which is, according to the company, their \u201cnew ambassador.\u201d   Sticking to their all-Italian pledge, the interiors of the A350 were styled by Walter De Silva, a car designer who worked for Fiat and Seat, before becoming head designer at Volkswagen. De Silva took his inspiration from the song \u201cIl cielo in una stanza,\u201d or \u201cThe sky in a room,\u201d he said in a press release.   That means bringing blue inside the aircraft \u2013 but not the bright blue planned for ITA planes\u2019 exteriors, but a more subtle, midnight blue. In economy seating, that blue becomes the base of the seat, with a sand-colored stripe down the middle. The colors are switched for \u201ccomfort economy\u201d seats which have a little more legroom, and for business class seats. There\u2019s a nod to the tricolore flag on the headrests, too.   For long-haul flights there will also be mood lighting depending on the stage of flight (boarding, take off, mid-flight, and meal times) as well as for sunrise, sunset and night time.  ITA plans to gradually upgrade its fleet from its current Alitalia aircraft to a fleet of new Airbuses, predicting that by late 2025, 75% of the fleet will be less environmentally damaging, new-generation aircraft.   Meanwhile, the uniforms \u2013 designed by Brunello Cucinelli \u2013 take a leap towards casual wear, with women able to wear white cap-sleeved T-shirts with sweater vests on top. A more traditional uniform, closer to the dark blue uniforms of Alitalia, is another option for crew. Women can choose between a skirt or pants, while the men\u2019s uniforms pep up Alitalia\u2019s navy suits with big gold buttons. Fiona Sinclair Scott, CNN Style\u2019s global editor, sees the new uniforms as a modernization of the classic flight attendant look. \u201cThere was a time when air travel was synonymous with ultimate luxury, regardless of seat assignment. The uniforms and dress codes of flight attendants, who were predominantly women, were designed to exude glamour and femininity, perhaps at the expense of comfort for those staff working long hours,\u201d she says.   \u201cToday, travel is more commonplace and cabin crews are more gender-balanced. The culture of travel has changed and we\u2019re undoubtedly seeing this reflected in uniforms.  \u201cWorkplace dress codes have relaxed in almost every industry so it\u2019s not surprising to see the inclusion of a T-shirt in these new designs, for example. While the new designs retain some of the hallmarks of flight attendant-wear, they\u2019ve been modernized with more casual styling such as the slightly cropped or turned-up trousers and the option of a boot for women. \u201cBrunello Cucinelli presented several double-breasted suits in his last two menswear collections and they\u2019ve carried over into this line too.\u201d   The uniforms will be rolled out over the next few months, according to the airline. ITA\u2019s gradual introduction of new looks is down to cost-cutting measures for the airline which was born from Alitalia\u2019s bankruptcy. And then there\u2019s the food. From June 2, intercontinental flights will serve meals planned by some of Italy\u2019s best chefs, starting with Enrico Bartolini \u2013 the only chef in history to have been awarded four Michelin stars in one year. Bartolini\u2019s debut menu for business class includes pappa al pomodoro, the signature tomato-and-bread warm \u201cpap\u201d from his native Tuscany, and chicken flavored with Amalfi essences, like lemon.  Economy will see a \u201ctotally renewed menu,\u201d while every item of food and drink on board will be an Italian brand or recipe. In the future, that focus on italianit\u00e0 will see coffee served as an \u201cexperience\u201d and wellness \u201cunique experiences\u201d on board. Whether that will include guided meditations, as several airlines already have on their in-flight entertainment systems, or full-on in-seat massages, as Virgin Atlantic used to offer, is not yet clear. ITA\u2019s gradual roll-out applies to its route map, too. It is launching routes from Rome to Los Angeles, Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires this month.",

            "text": "The chief executive of Qatar Airways has defended a plan to operate more than 160 extra flights to shuttle spectators from the region to Doha and back each day, for what has been advertised as the first \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d FIFA World Cup. Qatar Airways announced on Thursday it had partnered with regional carriers to allow World Cup ticket holders to fly into Doha and back from neighboring countries just for the day. Climate advocates say the decision flies in the face of the tournament\u2019s sustainability goals.  \u201cPlease don\u2019t believe people saying only negative [things],\u201d Akbar Al Baker told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson in an interview on Monday, adding that he was confident the flights would be full.  \u201c[We] have airplanes which have very low emissions compared to the normal aircraft most of the other airlines fly,\u201d including long-haul flights, he said. He did not elaborate on how the planes\u2019 emissions would be lower than others, but the airline\u2019s website says it uses \u201cone of the youngest fleets in the sky\u201d and has implemented 70 fuel optimization programs. Aviation is a major contributor to human-caused climate change. Qatar\u2019s economy is oil-based and has one of the biggest per capita carbon footprints in the world.    Before Thursday\u2019s announcement, organizers had estimated a carbon footprint for the tournament of more than 3.6 million metric tons of CO2, more than half of which will come from traveling supporters. The emissions from the new daily flights \u2013 from Dubai, Muscat, Riyadh, Jeddah and Kuwait \u2013 will add to the current estimate. In response to questions from CNN, FIFA said its previous carbon footprint estimate was published in February 2021 and that actual differences would be addressed once the tournament has concluded.  Qatar has said it will offset the emissions by \u201cinvesting in green projects\u201d \u2013 a common way for companies and people to cancel the impact of their footprint. Organizers have established a \u201cGlobal Carbon Council\u201d tasked with \u201cidentifying quality projects.\u201d  Climate experts, however, have highlighted the limitations of offsetting programs, such as tree planting, arguing that they are overused and their impact sometimes overstated, to allow for business-as-usual emissions from burning fossil fuels.  Carbon Market Watch published a report Tuesday that said the World Cup\u2019s carbon credit plan supported projects with a \u201clow level of environmental integrity\u201d and had so far issued only 130,000 credits of the pledged 1.8 million. The World Cup is due to start in late November. The Carbon Market Watch report also claims FIFA\u2019s estimated carbon emissions for the tournament have been grossly underestimated, criticizing \u201cthe choice of accounting approach.\u201d Commenting on the report, Qatar\u2019s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, which is responsible for the event, said it was \u201cspeculative and inaccurate to draw conclusions\u201d on its commitment to carbon neutrality. \u201cThe methodology used to calculate the carbon-neutral commitment is best in practice and was designed to be based on actual activity data, after the FIFA World Cup has concluded,\u201d  it said in a statement sent in response to CNN\u2019s questions. \u201cThis will be published, and any discrepancies will be explained and offset.\u201d  FIFA also responded to the report and defended its own accounting method, saying it was based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a widely used standard.  It added it had not \u201cmisled its stakeholders\u201d and was \u201cfully aware of the risks that mega-events pose on the economy, the natural environment and on people and communities.\u201d  In a September press release, the Qatari organizers of the event said one of the advantages of hosting the World Cup was \u201cthe compact nature\u201d of their country. The short distance between stadiums would negate the need for domestic air travel by fans and reduce the carbon footprint of the tournament. It went on to say air travel is \u201crecognized as one of the world\u2019s largest sources of carbon emissions.\u201d But there have been growing concerns that the small country of less than 3 million people may not be able to cope with so many fans. Flying spectators in and out in a day would alleviate the need for higher levels of accommodation. Al Baker, however, said it was always the plan to run the extra flights to shuttle people in just for the day.  \u201cHis Highness the Emir always wanted to share the benefit of this tournament with all of our neighbors,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt is feasible because, first and foremost, we have good state-of-the-art facilities. They process people very quickly. We have also brought in massive transportation facilities including the metro,\u201d Al Baker said.",

            "text": "What\u2019s the difference between flying on a small plane versus a large one, besides the price? Many misconceptions and preconceptions abound. Some people swear they only get airsickness on small planes, while others insist the on-board experience is more personalized. A small plane is one with a maximum certificated takeoff weight of 12,500 pounds or less, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  These planes, made by companies such as Cessna and Piper, can hold anywhere from 1-20 passengers. They\u2019re used for private aviation, but not exclusively. Some smaller planes can operate commercially on short routes or operate sightseeing flights. One example is the tourist flights that go over Peru\u2019s Nazca Lines \u2013 most are operated on a 12-seat Cessna Grand Caravan, on which six people are lined along each side of the plane to guarantee everyone a window seat.  Toni-Grace Bush, a flight instructor based in Brisbane, Australia, addresses some of the most common questions about flying on these aircraft.     Are you more likely to get motion sickness on a small craft? In short \u2013 yes. \u201cMotion sickness is definitely more prevalent in general aviation because of how much more small craft feel pockets of air,\u201d Bush explains. \u201c[The] smaller craft that I fly around are below 5,000 feet, which is typically where a lot of the more volatile weather vectors can be.\u201d  She lists several of the most common causes of air queasiness: heat, loud noises and turbulence. The latter two are particularly prevalent on smaller planes. \u201cIt\u2019s much bumpier, and you do feel the turbulence more, especially during takeoff and landing.\u201d Bush compares it to sailing: \u201cThe faster the boat travels, the more it skims over the waves and the less turbulence it feels. It\u2019s the same with aircraft.\u201d If you are more prone to motion sickness, go ahead and take your remedy of choice ahead of boarding \u2013 even if you don\u2019t end up needing it, better safe than sorry. Bush has experience doing aerobatics, so she knows how to handle various levels of queasiness. She offers up these suggestions: \u201cMake sure you are well rested, have a little food in your tummy but not too much, and make sure you\u2019re hydrated.\u201d   Is there more freedom in terms of what you can bring on board? Not really. Smaller aircraft have weight limits, so you need to plan ahead and pack responsibly. You also need to follow the same rules you would if flying on a bigger jet. \u201cA lot of the legislation airlines have to abide for what you can and can\u2019t access is still relevant on small aircraft,\u201d says Bush. For example, in her native Australia travelers must have permission to carry a firearm on any aircraft, regardless of size. Local laws still apply, so do your research first. There are also weight limits on board smaller planes. Travelers may have to step on the scale before boarding and have their baggage weighed as well.  \u201cTravel as lightly as possible,\u201d Bush advises. \u201cif you have to travel with other personal belongings, then the pilot would have to sacrifice fuel to accommodate for that.\u201d     Why are small planes so loud?  Small planes are loud for the same reason that its passengers are more likely to experience turbulence: There isn\u2019t as much space to absorb wind force and sound. Bush advises everyone on a small plane to have adequate ear protection, especially kids, whose ears are more sensitive.  Some planes provide ear coverings, but it\u2019s never a bad idea to have your own handy. \u201cOnce you lose your hearing, you lose your hearing,\u201d she warns. Ear damage can be permanent, so plan ahead.  Are small planes more dangerous? This is a common question, especially when attention is drawn to high-profile incidents involving public figures flying on board private planes.  But you should take a deep breath and try not to assume the worst. \u201cThere is always potential for an accident/incident to occur no matter what size the aircraft is,\u201d explains Bush. \u201cWhile there are more variables \u2013 age (of the plane), condition of aircraft systems, experience of pilot, weather \u2013 in general aviation aircraft that may lead to accidents/incidents in smaller aircraft \u2026 the aviation industry is held to a high safety standard regardless of the size of the plane.\u201d On planes, just like anywhere else, having knowledge and a sense of control will make you feel more at ease.  According to data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), there are at most a few dozen commercial plane crashes per year in the United States. Between 2010 and 2021, there were a grand total of two fatalities on board commercial craft.   Is it better to bring pets on smaller craft? You have probably seen headlines about the desperate people hiring private planes to ferry their pets out of places with strict quarantines and Covid lockdowns.  Private and commercial aviation both have their pros and cons in this department.   If you can afford to fly animals on smaller specialty craft, it may be worth it just for your own peace of mind \u2013 some high-end aviation companies, like VistaJet, have specially trained crew members on board who know how to work with animals and have taken pet CPR courses.  Both will require a fair amount of paperwork, so you should keep up to date on shots and health visits, and get your pet a passport if needed. (Yep, that\u2019s a real thing.) Ask your vet for advice in advance. Some private plane companies have dedicated staff members who will walk you through the process \u2013 from documentation to boarding \u2013 as part of the cost of the ticket. ",

The deal is a boost for Boeing\n            \n                (BA), anchoring long-standing customer Norwegian to the US plane maker after the Oslo-based airline earlier this year said it would consider switching to rival Airbus\n            \n                (EADSF). For Norwegian, the deal marks a return to aircraft ownership after it was forced to resort to leasing deals during bankruptcy proceedings that rescued the company last year.   The deal includes compensation to Norwegian as settlement for previous disputes over Max and Dreamliner aircraft deliveries and technical issues, triggering a financial gain of 2 billion Norwegian crowns ($212.2 million), the airline said. Norwegian\u2019s shares jumped 8.4% by 0857 GMT, outperforming a 0.3% gain in Oslo\u2019s benchmark index. The shares have now risen about 12% since the airline was recapitalized a year ago. The conflict with Boeing was the sole issue that had not been resolved during last year\u2019s restructuring of the airline, Norwegian Air Chief Executive Geir Karlsen told Reuters. \u201cThis was the final piece of the puzzle \u2026 it will terminate the lawsuits,\u201d Karlsen said. The financial gain will be booked as soon as a deal is signed, expected by the end of June, boosting the airline\u2019s equity.  The first 50 aircraft will be delivered between 2025 and 2028, corresponding to current lease expirations, resulting in a limited net increase of the company\u2019s current fleet. \u201cThis is a landmark deal that sets out a path whereby Norwegian will own a large share of its fleet,\u201d board Chair Svein Harald Oeygard said. \u201cThis will result in lower all-in costs and increased financial robustness, enabling us to further solidify our Nordic stronghold.\u201d Norwegian in February told Reuters it was considering a switch to Airbus unless ongoing litigation with Boeing over previous aircraft cancellations was resolved in a timely fashion. The deal with Norwegian is Boeing\u2019s second major European order in recent weeks for Max aircraft following a deal with airlines giant IAG.",

            "text": "To most investors, navigating today\u2019s stock market is as treacherous as walking the plank. But for luxury investors, it\u2019s more like strutting down the catwalk.  The United States may very well be hurtling toward a recession and the Nasdaq is suffering its worst 100-day performance on record. But luxury spending is up 14% year to date, according to Bank of America aggregated US credit & debit card data. In short: Our weekdays are filled with photos of traders holding their heads in their hands at the New York Stock Exchange, and our weekends have been filled with photos of Kanye West and Balenciaga models stomping through the narrow alleyways of \u2026 that same exchange.  \u201cMoney is probably the biggest fetish in the world,\u201d said Demna, the creative director of Balenciaga, while backstage at his NYSE fashion show last weekend, The luxe fashion house is now selling NYSE-branded shirts for $800. And why not? US luxury spending was 47% higher in 2021 than in pre-Covid 2019, while jewelry spending was 40% higher, according to Bank of America data. General stock market chaos isn\u2019t a headwind either, they say.  \u201cWe believe that many investors think that US luxury demand is highly correlated to stock market performance as a large proportion of household wealth is tied up in this asset class,\u201d wrote Bank of America analysts in a recent note. But that\u2019s far from the case: The bank\u2019s data showed that in the 10 years prior to Covid, the correlation between luxury spending and the S&P 500 was less than 30%. There was no correlation at all between the price of cryptocurrency and luxury spending.  \u201cVery strong demand from US luxury customers was the biggest positive tailwind in 2021. The strength has continued in 2022 despite a more complex macroeconomic backdrop. Higher-income consumer demand for luxury is accelerating, which we attribute to reopening and more purchase occasions (return of weddings, galas, holidays, etc.),\u201d they wrote.  If there werea Walmart vs. Weitzman matchup today, the luxe shoe brand would take the belt. Walmart and Target have felt the brunt of rising inflation and supply-chain kinks.  \u201cUS inflation levels, particularly in food and fuel, created more pressure on margin mix and operating costs than we expected,\u201d said Walmart CEO Doug McMilon after the company posted weaker-than-expected first quarter earnings and cut its full-year profit forecast last week.  Walmart stock is down more than 18% for the month and Target is down nearly 30%. By contrast, Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) fell just 5.6%, Burberry is up more than 8% and Tapestry, the company behind Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, has grown by more than 2%. The S&P 500 is about 3% lower for the month.  As the West presents some good news for luxury brands, China\u2019s Covid-related shutdowns, however, have caused some concern. China\u2019s strict containment measures in response to the latest surge in Covid have shuttered luxury stores and left goods intended to be shipped around the world stuck in Chinese ports. But increased demand in the US and Europe has offset those losses, said Ferragamo CEO Marco Gobbetti during a recent conference call.  The second quarter is also less exposed to Chinese consumption because there\u2019s less travel and less important shopping holidays, giving luxury brands some breathing room as Asia begins to lift restrictions again. The hope is that by the third quarter, Chinese consumers will revert to \u201crevenge shopping\u201d from pent-up demand during lockdowns.  Still, luxury stocks are priced as though they\u2019re in recession, wrote Bank of America analysts. \u201cThe luxury goods sector continues to come under pressure now as a result of the rising Covid cases in China,\u201d said the note. There have been six prior pullbacks of the luxury industry over the past two decades: The 2000-2001 dot com bubble, the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, the 2013-2014 Chinese anti-corruption campaign, China-US trade hostilities in 2018, the Covid pandemic; and China\u2019s Common Prosperity announcement in 2021. Those pullbacks have grown shorter and less severe over time. The first three pullbacks, on average, resulted in a 52% decline peak-to-trough over 85 weeks and took 119 weeks to recover back to the previous peak, BofA analysts found. But the last three pullbacks declined just -22% on average in 8 weeks and took only 20 weeks to recover back to previous highs. If the patterns remain the same, then \u201chistory shows Covid-related restrictions in China are not likely to destroy luxury demand, only shift the timing, and that a share price pullback on this (low-multiple event) would be a particularly good buying opportunity,\u201d wrote Bank of America analysts.  The evidence at hand might indicate that this downturn isn\u2019t hitting all Americans equally. The recovery from the short-lived Covid recession was what people refer to as K-shaped. That happens when separate communities recover from economic downturns at varying rates. Some sectors of society may experience renewed growth while others continue to lag.  Growth in US fashion luxury spending grew among all income groups in 2021 as the economy recovered from Covid shocks and markets shot higher. That hasn\u2019t been the case in 2022. Luxury spending growth has been strongest amongst the higher-income cohort, up 26% year-over-year. Lower-income earners have dropped their consumption of luxury goods by 5%.  It\u2019s impossible to draw conclusions from such a small data sample, but the numbers sugget that this downturn could be a repeat of the 2020 K-shaped recession when many who worked in white-collar jobs recovered quickly as the government handed out stimulus payments and stocks and home prices appreciated. Those without savings and who worked service jobs continued to suffer, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Today, it appears that Walmart shoppers are getting dinged while Balenciaga shoppers are getting $800 NYSE shirts. Republican Senators fight back against ESG push \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility\u201d is an adage that both Spider-Man and asset managers have taken to heart. Some Republican Senators don\u2019t like that \u2013 at least when it comes to asset managers.  Over the past few decades investors have flocked to index-tracking funds that give them broad access to markets for accessible prices. Large asset managers, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, have grown accordingly. Together the three companies manage $22 trillion in assets. That\u2019s equivalent to more than half the value of all shares for all the companies in the S&P 500.  That\u2019s a lot of money. And a lot of shares. And that means these asset managers have loads of voting power over public companies.  Lately they\u2019ve been using that power to advocate for ESG-friendly changes. They\u2019ve pushed companies to diversify their executive staff and boards, to focus on environmentally-friendly policies and to invest in labor.  This year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink asked companies to set short-, medium- and long-term goals to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cThese targets, and the quality of plans to meet them, are critical to the long-term economic interests of your shareholders,\u201d he said. Leaders in the Alaska energy sector were unhappy with that pressure. They complained to their Republican Senator Dan Sullivan, who in turn introduced legislation that would allow voting choices to be available to individual investors in passive funds if money managers own more than 1% of a company\u2019s shares. In other words, the investors parking money in the funds, not the fund managers, would have the voting power. The bill is co-sponsored by 11 other Republican Senators.  \u201cThe whole ESG movement is not reflective of what America wants,\u201d said Sullivan in a recent \u201cSquawk Box\u201d interview. \u201cWhy should these three companies that have monopoly power be able to vote on all these shares? It\u2019s distorted the market tremendously to have these three companies that have massive, massive power. They own 88% of the S&P. That is a distortion of capital markets and it reflects on the energy policies we are talking about.\u201d BlackRock said late last year that it would soon roll out technology to allow proxy voting by clients.

            "text": "Chipmaker Broadcom is buying cloud services provider VMware in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $61 billion to speed up its expansion into the enterprise software business. The purchase announced on Thursday is the second-biggest globally so far in 2022, after Microsoft\u2019s $68.7 billion buyout of video game maker Activision Blizzard. VMware shareholders will get $142.50 per share under the purchase, resulting in a premium of nearly 49% to the stock\u2019s close on May 22, when talks of the deal were first reported. Broadcom will assume $8 billion of VMware net debt, the company said. Broadcom shares were up 1.6% in premarket trading, while VMWare fell nearly 1%. Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan had said the company is seeing that enterprise spending is \u201con fire.\u201d Buying VMware would give Broadcom access to the software firm\u2019s cloud clients and their data centers, and will help it capitalize on this trend further. Software became a substantial part of Broadcom\u2019s business after it acquired CA Technologies for $18.9 billion in 2018 and Symantec\u2019s security division for $10.7 billion in 2019. The bid to buy VMware is Broadcom\u2019s second-biggest takeover attempt, after its failed attempt to buy smartphone chip behemoth Qualcomm for more than $100 billion in 2018.",

The Tango D10S \u2013 a 12-seater financed by an Argentine fintech company - is designed as a flying museum in tribute to the former World Cup winner, who died of a heart attack in November 2020.   It features a picture of Maradona kissing the World Cup trophy on the fuselage, while his face is also on the tail. The wings feature both of his goals from Argentina\u2019s 2-1 victory over England in the 1986 World Cup quarter-final: the \u2018Hand of God\u2019 goal on the left wing and the winner, a goal widely regarded as the greatest of all time, on the right. \u201cI am mad about Maradona, one of those people who still watch videos of Diego before I go to sleep at night,\u201d Gaston Kolker, CEO of fintech company Give and Get, told Reuters. \u201cThis is the first World Cup without Maradona and maybe the last with (Lionel) Messi. I said, I want to make Diego\u2019s plane, I want to make Diego\u2019s plane. And so we launched Tango D10S. \u201cWhen Maradona\u2019s team mates saw it, the World Cup winners from 1986, they were amazed, they were hypnotized by the aircraft,\u201d Kolker said at an unveiling with other members from that World Cup winning side.  The plan is to fly the plane around Argentina and eventually to Qatar for the World Cup in November. Fans will be able to board the aircraft and leave a message for Maradona in the cockpit, \u2018interact\u2019 with the late player through artificial intelligence, and see memorabilia from him and others players from the 1986 team.   It will also be available for private hire before being auctioned for charity. \u201cWe can\u2019t believe or understand this craziness, the love involved,\u201d Maradona\u2019s daughter Dalma said. \u201cHow far will fans go? As far as a plane.\u201d",

            "text": "Boeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft made a safe return home from its five-day stay at the International Space Station on Wednesday, concluding a long-awaited test mission that could pave the way for the Starliner to launch astronauts for the first time later this year.  After detaching from its port at the ISS Wednesday afternoon, the spacecraft spent about four hours gradually lowering its altitude. As it approached Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the spacecraft lit its thrusters in a fiery blaze of heat and speed before deploying parachutes to slow its descent. It landed in a puff of sand at 6:49 pm ET in a remote area of the New Mexican desert, called White Sands, which has long been the site of aerospace and weapons tests. The capsule touched down three-tenths of a mile away from the targeted landing site, which the webcast hosts described as \u201c\u201dbasically a bullseye.\u201d The safe return of the capsule marks a major milestone for Boeing, which has spent years trying to right the program after a string of mishaps and delays that tarnished the once-sterling reputation of the company\u2019s space business. This mission was crewed only by a spacesuit-clad mannequin for this test mission, but NASA and Boeing could deem the Starliner ready to fly its first load of NASA astronauts to the ISS by the end of 2022.  Officials plan to conduct an extensive review of the data collected on this trip, which did encounter a few minor setbacks. They included issues with four of the spacecraft\u2019s on-board thrusters, which orient and maneuver the vehicle as it flies through space. The thruster hitch did not impact the overall mission, as the Starliner is equipped with backups, Boeing and NASA officials told reporters. But it does raise questions about the root cause of the problem and whether it could point to deeper issues on a spacecraft that has grappled with numerous technical hangups throughout its development. Notably, the first attempt to send the Starliner on an orbital test run in late 2019 had to be cut short \u2014 taking the vehicle directly back to land rather than to an ISS docking \u2014 after software issues sent the vehicle off course. It took nearly two years of troubleshooting before the Starliner was ready to return to the launch pad. Then, an issue with sticky valves further delayed the capsule\u2019s return to flight. Despite its setbacks, NASA has stood by Boeing, which is one of two companies \u2014 the other being SpaceX \u2014 that the space agency tapped to build an astronaut-worthy spacecraft after the Space Shuttle Program retired in 2011. While even the space agency initially expected that Boeing, a decades-long partner of NASA\u2019s, would beat SpaceX to the launch pad, Boeing is now two years behind its rival. SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon spacecraft entered operation in 2020 and has flown five missions for NASA so far.  \u201cWe intended to learn a lot,\u201d Boeing\u2019s Starliner program manager Mark Nappi told reporters Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take that information and apply it in the development of our spacecraft. We are very satisfied by what we\u2019ve learned how the team has reacted to it.\u201d NASA\u2019s hope is that Boeing\u2019s Starliner and SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon will give its human spaceflight program redundancy, meaning that if one spacecraft or the other enounters and issue and has to be grounded, it won\u2019t affect NASA\u2019s ability to get crew to the ISS.",

            "text": "Samsung on Tuesday outlined a plan to pour more than $350 billion into its businesses and create tens of thousands of new jobs over the next five years. Despite an uncertain economic environment exacerbated by long-running supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine, the South Korean conglomerate said that it would invest 450 trillion won ($356 billion) through 2026, primarily in core businesses such as chipmaking and biopharmaceuticals. That marks a 30% jump from what it spent in the previous five-year period. The bulk of the investment \u2014 360 trillion Korean won ($285 billion) \u2014 will be invested in South Korea. It did not specify where the rest of the funding would be allocated.  The group is also embarking on a hiring spree that will create 80,000 new jobs through 2026, \u201cor about 16,000 positions annually,\u201d it said in a statement. Previously, its goal was to generate 40,000 jobs from 2021 to 2023.  Most of the jobs are expected to be in South Korea. But the tech giant also has research and development centers across the globe, including in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, and the Philippines. Samsung is best known for its electronics division, with its popular smartphones and televisions. In recent years, the company has leaned further into its role as a provider of semiconductors as manufacturers around the world suffer from shortages. Memory chips, which have proved to be a key moneymaker for Samsung, will continue to be a focus area with further investment planned, according to the firm. On the consumer side, the company plans to beef up its development of 6G, the next generation of wireless telecommunications technology. The news comes just days after US President Joe Biden visited a Samsung semiconductor factory at the start of a visit to Asia.  \u201cSo much of the future of the world is going to be written here, in the Indo-Pacific, in the next several decades,\u201d Biden said while stopping by the plant in South Korea.",

            "text": "Boeing managed to dock a spacecraft at the International Space Station late last week, but it was not without several minor hangups.  The mission kicked off Thursday evening with a Florida launch, and the Starliner \u2014 which is designed to carry astronauts but is flying without people for this test \u2014 docked with the ISS Friday night at 8:28 pm ET. The docking occurred about an hour later than expected as ground crews worked through a few issues, including a software issue that skewed graphics, sort of like a misaligned GPS map. There were also issues with sensors and some docking components that were not initially moving correctly. The capsule has a docking ring that pops out as it approaches its port and is used to latch on to the ISS. During the first attempt at docking, some components didn\u2019t move into the proper configuration. Ground teams had to try the pop-out process a second time to get everything in the right place. There had also been a small problem with the Starliner\u2019s cooling loops, which are part of the system that regulates the spacecraft\u2019s temperature. All those issues had to be analyzed or fixed in time for the Starliner to move ahead, and the docking ultimately went off without a major issue. \u201cIt was really nail-biting watching that vehicle sit out there for a while until it was it was time to come in,\u201d Mark Nappi, Boeing\u2019s Starliner program manager, told reporters Friday night. Looming over the mission, however, has been several other issues with the spacecraft\u2019s on-board thrusters, which maneuver and orient that vehicle as it sails through space. Two of those thrusters shut down prematurely shortly after the spacecraft reached orbit. A couple of other thrusters had problems later on.  Despite the setbacks, the spacecraft was performing \u201cbeautifully,\u201d according to Steve Stich, the manager of NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, which oversees Starliner as well as SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon program. \u201cOf course this is a test flight, and as those that probably watched throughout the day, you saw that we\u2019re learning along the way, and it\u2019s very exciting,\u201d Stich said on a press call Friday night. NASA and Boeing officials said that the thruster issues aren\u2019t major concerns because the Starliner has \u201ca lot\u201d of built-in backups, Stich said. There are 48 such thrusters on the vehicle, and the capsule\u2019s onboard computers can choose to use one thruster over another if it detects anything slightly off. Although Boeing does want to understand why the thrusters weren\u2019t working as planned, according to Nappi, it might not happen.  \u201cWe may never know what the real cause of this is,\u201d he said.  Engineers narrowed the thruster issues down to \u201csix or seven\u201d possible causes, with three that seemed most likely. Zeroing in on the exact issue may require engineers to see the thrusters in person, something that can\u2019t happen because the thrusters are attached to the service module \u2014 a part that will be jettisoned and left to burn up in the atmosphere before the Starliner makes its controlled return to Earth. That\u2019s expected to happen in the next few days. The Starliner will undock from the ISS, maneuver its way toward home, then use its thrusters to slice back into the thick part of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere before parachuting to a landing in the desert of New Mexico. If all that goes well, it will be massive win for Boeing, which is coming off of years of delays and development hangups with Starliner. The spacecraft\u2019s first attempt at completing an orbital test mission in 2019 had to be returned from space prematurely, without completing an ISS docking, because of software issues. A second attempt to launch Starliner to the ISS in August last year was scrapped after pre-flight checks discovered issues with key valves becoming stuck.  If this mission is completed safely, Boeing\u2019s Starliner could launch astronauts by the end of 2022.",

            "text": "Investors took a break from selling in May and going away, for one day at least.  Stocks soared Monday, as positive news about earnings from banking powerhouse JPMorgan Chase and comments from President Joe Biden about the possibility of lifting some US tariffs on China boosted sentiment on Wall Street. The Dow gained nearly 620 points Monday, a gain of about 2%. Dow component JPMorgan Chase\n            \n                (JPM) surged 6% after the Wall Street giant raised its outlook for interest income, a key measure of profitability.   Fellow financials Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS), American Express\n            \n                (AXP) and Visa\n            \n                (V) were among the other big winners in the Dow Monday. The S&P 500 rose 1.9%. JPMorgan Chase was one of the best performers in that blue-chip index too. Citigroup\n            \n                (C), Bank of America\n            \n                (BAC), Wells Fargo\n            \n                (WFC) and Comerica\n            \n                (CMA) were also S&P 500 leaders. Banks have been market losers so far this year, even though many financials should benefit from the fact that the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates. Higher rates should boost lending profits, but investors seem more worried about surging inflation and rate hikes eventually leading to a slowdown in the housing market and broader economy. The strong outlook from JPMorgan Chase may temporarily put some of those fears to rest.  Mahmood Noorani, co-founder and CEO at Quant Insight, said many financial stocks were oversold and had become cheap. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF\n            \n                (XLF), which owns most of the top banks, surged more than 3% Monday. But Noorani added that the broader market may not rebound for good until there is \u201cmore visibility\u201d about how fast the Fed is going to raise rates and when the hiking cycle will end. \u201cAll measures of uncertainty will remain elevated. At the moment the Fed tells us it\u2019s done, the sell-off will reverse,\u201d he said. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index was up 1.6% Monday. Talk from Biden about possibly rolling back tariffs on Chinese imports would be good news for the tech sector, which does a lot of business in China. Shares of Apple\n            \n                (AAPL) and Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT) were also among the leaders in the Dow, as were industrial giants Caterpillar\n            \n                (CAT) and Boeing\n            \n                (BA), which also generate a solid chunk of sales from China. Biden\u2019s comments were cheered by investors, even though he also warned about possible military action against China if it attacked Taiwan. Biden has continued to talk tough about China, but he has also suggested that he\u2019s willing to reconsider some of the restrictions put in place by the Trump administration. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also said last week that she\u2019s concerned about the impact that the tariffs are having on American consumers and businesses. The trade skirmish with China may be partly to blame for supply chain disruptions and high inflation.  But it will take more than a one day rally for the mood on Wall Street to really improve. The CNN Business Fear & Greed Index, which measures seven gauges of investor sentiment, remains at Extreme Fear levels. Stocks are also still down sharply for the month of May and all of 2022. The S&P 500 is not far from bear market territory, having plunged about 17% this year. The Nasdaq is already in a bear market, having plummeted more than 26% so far in 2022. The Dow is down 12% this year.",

            "text": "A shipment of 35 tons of baby formula has arrived Sunday in Indianapolis on a US military aircraft from Germany to address a nationwide shortage. The prescription formula will be distributed to areas around the country where there is the most acute need, a Biden administration official earlier told CNN. But the official said none of the first shipment would land on store shelves in the US, adding that Sunday\u2019s shipment is hypoallergenic and will be fed to babies intolerant of protein in cow milk. The shipment included 132 pallets of formula, which arrived on one C-17 cargo plane. The formula originated from Zurich, Switzerland, and was trucked to Germany, where it was loaded on the C-17 and flown to the US. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who greeted the arrival of the delivery in Indianapolis, said Sunday\u2019s shipment \u2013 the first of Operation Fly Formula \u2013 would provide enough formula for 9,000 babies and 18,000 toddlers for one week.  \u201cIt is a large shipment of very specific and specialized formula. Formula for moms and dads who have children who have allergies where the regular formula just simply will not work,\u201d the secretary said at a news conference in Indianapolis shortly after the shipment landed.  The Biden administration official told CNN earlier that the product contained in the first shipment will be distributed to hospitals, doctors, home health care facilities and pharmacies in regions \u201cwhere the needs are most acute.\u201d The aircraft on Sunday transported pallets of Nestl\u00e9 Health Science formula \u2013 including Alfamino Infant and Alfamino Junior. At the site of the arrival in Indianapolis, a Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson said, \u201cSome cases are ready for distribution in the next couple of days. Others will be released into the supply chain after standard quality testing is completed.\u201d The White House announced later Sunday that the second flight of Operation Fly Formula, which includes \u201c114 pallets of Gerber Good Start\u00ae Extensive HA infant formula,\u201d was expected to \u201ctake place in the coming days.\u201d The White House said the \u201ctotal amount of formula arriving in the first round of Operation Fly Formula\u201d is the equivalent of 1.5 million doses of eight-ounce bottles. President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced Operation Fly Formula, which directs the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture to utilize the Defense Department\u2019s commercial planes to import formula from abroad. Separately, the Biden administration on Sunday evening announced the first two Defense Production Act authorizations for infant formula amid the ongoing nationwide formula shortage. The two \u201cpriority orders,\u201d the administration said, are Reckitt and Abbott Nutrition, the baby formula manufacturer at the heart of a nationwide formula recall. The authorizations would allow those companies to urgently receive materials such as sugar, corn syrup, filters, which help make formula. Frustration for American families The shipment comes as the shortage of baby formula has caused major disruptions and frustration for some desperate American families. Already, some families have begun rationing their supply of formula, while others have turned to hospitals when they can\u2019t find the kind they need. And in a clear sign of the deep effects of the crisis, a doctor at Le Bonheur Children\u2019s Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, said last week that he admitted two young patients \u2013 a toddler and a preschooler \u2013 because the specialty formula they need is out of stock and they haven\u2019t been able to tolerate any replacements. Clinical dietitians at Medical University of South Carolina Shawn Jenkins Children\u2019s Hospital in Charleston have reported that at least four babies were recently hospitalized for complications related to the ongoing formula shortage, according to a spokesperson for MUSC. The spokesperson said three of the four babies were hospitalized due to intolerance of formula that parents had to try because of shortages, while one was sickened by mineral imbalances from caregivers mixing their own formula. On Sunday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams declared a state of emergency over the nationwide shortage of the supply of infant formula. A statement from his office said the move would \u201cempower the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) to prevent price gouging for formula.\u201d Retailers nationwide have been struggling to keep shelves fully stocked as supply chain problems persist, slowing down both production and distribution of goods. According to market research firm IRI, stores\u2019 infant formula inventories in mid-January were down 17% from where they were in mid-February 2020, just before the pandemic hit US shores. The shutting down of the country\u2019s largest formula plant in February exacerbated pandemic-related supply chain issues and supercharged the nationwide shortage. The out-of-stock rate for baby formula hovered between 2% and 8% in the first half of 2021, but began rising sharply last July. Between November 2021 and early April 2022, the out-of-stock rate jumped to 31%, data from Datasembly showed. That rate increased another 9 percentage points in just three weeks in April, and now stands at 40%, the statistics show. The baby formula shortage has thrown the White House into crisis mode and opened yet another political wound going into an already challenging midterm election season, frustrating the West Wing and the rest of the administration as they struggle with how little control they have over a situation that is centered at the US Food and Drug Administration, an independent agency that the White House neither controls nor gets direct reports from. Officials have faced criticism that the FDA moved too slowly to address warning signs. At the same time, they have been attempting to learn whether formula companies are actually short on ingredients, while also trying to tackle potential price gouging. Vilsack said in Indianapolis on Sunday that the federal government is working with suppliers of baby formula in the US to increase production and address the nationwide shortage. He had said the government is working to help get the Abbott facility in Michigan up and running, through the aid of the Defense Production Act.  The agriculture secretary also said an agreement with the FDA would allow the Abbott facility and others to \u201cjump ahead of line for the necessary supplies that are necessary and required in order to produce the formula.\u201d More flights expected Earlier Sunday, President Joe Biden touted the first flight from his administration\u2019s baby formula airlift operation on Twitter.   \u201cFolks, I\u2019m excited to tell you that the first flight from Operation Fly Formula is loaded up with more than 70,000 pounds of infant formula and about to land in Indiana. Our team is working around the clock to get safe formula to everyone who needs it,\u201d Biden said on Twitter. National Economic Council director Brian Deese told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that as part of the airlift operation, more flights with baby formula \u201cwill be coming in early this week.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep ramping that up until we get there,\u201d Deese said.  Pressed by Bash on how the US ended up in a position in which baby formula has to be airlifted into the country, Deese in part blamed market consolidation.  \u201cIt goes back to this question of how we can bring more competition in our economy, have more providers have this formula so that no individual company has this much control over supply chains,\u201d he said.  The Biden administration official told CNN earlier that the product was coming from a factory that has already gone through US FDA approval \u2013 meaning US inspectors would only need to conduct \u201cspot checks\u201d Sunday after the product lands. Those checks include ensuring that the product was not damaged in transit and has appropriate labeling. An FDA inspector was onsite to conduct the spot check. Separately, Nestl\u00e9 is also going to conduct its own quality check at its local distribution site. \u201cThis shipment is essentially going to get off this cargo plane, then the Federal Express folks are going to take it from there, they are going to deliver it to a distribution center that the Nestl\u00e9 Gerber folks have here in Indiana, and then it\u2019s going to go on trucks and it\u2019s going to be delivered in hospitals and home health care clinics across the country, providing support and help,\u201d Vilsack said Sunday. Additionally, the Biden administration is engaged in conversations with makers of other European baby formula to approve and obtain excess supplies for US distribution, the administration official told CNN. Indianapolis was chosen as the arrival site for the formula because the Nestl\u00e9 distribution site is located there. The official added that the administration is plugging into the existing distribution chain. \u201cWe\u2019re turning a two-week process into 72 hours,\u201d the official said. This story and headline have been updated for additional developments.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered the first flights supporting the newly created Operation Fly Formula program, and they will \u201cdepart Ramstein Air Base in Germany over the course of this weekend,\u201d the White House official said. \u201cDue to the urgency of the situation, these flights will comprise U.S. military aircraft,\u201d the official said.  Using military aircraft for this endeavor is unusual and underscores the urgent nature of the situation.  The administration\u2019s plan going forward is to use commercially contracted aircraft, but none were available this weekend, according to an official. The official promised further updates on the remaining 114 pallets of Gerber Good Start Extensive HA, \u201cwhich are expected to arrive in the coming days.\u201d The first flights over the weekend will transport 132 pallets of Nestl\u00e9 Health Science formula \u2013 including Alfamino Infant and Alfamino Junior \u2013 to Indianapolis. The White House has said these specific formulas have been prioritized because they serve a critical medical purpose and are in short supply in the United States because of the Abbott Nutrition plant closure in Michigan. The FDA has reached an agreement with Abbott Nutrition to reopen the plant, which has been shuttered for months because of contamination issues. The agreement lays out steps the manufacturer must take to restart production at its plant.  The baby formula shortage has thrown the White House into crisis mode and opened yet another political wound going into an already challenging midterm election season, frustrating the West Wing and the rest of the administration as they struggle with how little control they have over a situation that is centered at the US Food and Drug Administration, an independent agency that the White House neither controls nor gets direct reports from. Officials are now confronting criticism that the FDA moved too slowly to address warning signs. At the same time, they\u2019re attempting to learn whether formula companies are actually short on ingredients, while also trying to tackle potential price gouging. President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced Operation Fly Formula, which directs the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture to utilize the Defense Department\u2019s commercial planes to import formula from abroad. He also said he would be invoking the Defense Production Act, which allows the government more control over industrial production during emergencies, to direct suppliers of formula ingredients to prioritize delivery to the manufacturers of formula.   Biden\u2019s administration has also taken other steps over the last two weeks to address concerns about a months-long formula shortage, which has parents in different parts of the country scouring stores to feed their children. The administration established a website last week, HHS.gov/formula, to provide resources to families in need. But when a CNN reporter tested out some of those options, the exercise resulted in apologetic customer service representatives, one hold time that lasted well over an hour and serious challenges in finding baby formula through some of the main suggestions listed on the new HHS website. This story has been updated with additional details Friday.",

            "title": "Boeing launches Starliner astronaut capsule on uncrewed test mission",
            "text": "Boeing launched its Starliner spacecraft, designed to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station, on an uncrewed test mission toward the orbiting outpost Thursday evening. After two prior attempts to complete such a mission failed, Boeing\u2019s goal is to prove the spacecraft can dock with the ISS. It must succeed before it can move on to missions with people on board. The spacecraft took to the skies at 6:54 pm ET Thursday, riding atop an Atlas V rocket that launched from Florida\u2019s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. After the rocket delivered the capsule into orbit, the spacecraft fired up its own thrusters to orient it in the right direction. Boeing officials confirmed the Starliner\u2019s \u201corbital insertion\u201d \u2014 a sign the spacecraft is on the right path \u2014 about half an hour after liftoff. But during a post-launch briefing, officials revealed that the thrusters didn\u2019t work exactly as intended.  \u201cWe had two to thrusters fail,\u201d Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing\u2019s Starliner program, said. \u201cThe first one that fired, it fired for a second and then it shut down. The flight control system did was what it\u2019s supposed to, and it turned it over to the second thruster.\u201d That thruster then fired for only about 25 seconds before shutting down, according to Nappi. The flight control system again took over and kicked on a third thruster, which fired as intended. \u201cThe system is designed to be redundant and it preformed like it was supposed to,\u201d Nappi told reporters Thursday night. The issue is not expected to impact the overall mission, Nappi said. On board this flight are some supplies for the astronauts already on board the ISS as well as a spacesuit-clad mannequin, named Rosie, after the World War II-era Rosie the Riveter.  Starliner has proven a difficult program for Boeing, which originally hoped the spacecraft would be operational in 2017 but has been plagued by delays and development hangups. The first attempt of this test flight, called OFT-1, in 2019 was cut short because of an issue with the Starliner\u2019s onboard clock. The error caused the thrusters onboard the capsule to misfire, knocking it off course, and officials decided to bring the spacecraft back home rather than continue the mission. It took more than a year to root out that issue and a series of other software problems. More recently, the Starliner has been beleaguered by valve issues. When the spacecraft was rolled out to the launch pad in August of 2021, a pre-flight check revealed that key valves had been stuck in place, and engineers weren\u2019t able to immediately troubleshoot the issue. Eventually the capsule had to be rolled back from the launch pad. When engineers were not able to fix it at the site, it ultimately had to be taken all the way back to Boeing\u2019s factory for more thorough troubleshooting. The valves have since become an ongoing source of contention for the company. According to a recent report from Reuters, the subcontractor that manufactures the valves, Alabama-based Aerojet Rocketdyne, has been at odds with Boeing over the root cause of the valve issue.  Boeing and NASA disagree, according to the report and comments from NASA officials during recent press conferences. Their investigation pointed to moisture getting into the valves and causing \u201ccorrosion\u201d and \u201cbinding,\u201d Boeing vice president and Starliner program manager, Mark Nappi, said at a press conference last week. That led the company to devise a short-term solution, creating a purge system, which involves a small bag, designed to keep out corrosion-causing moisture. NASA and Boeing say they\u2019re comfortable with this solution. \u201cWe\u2019re in really good shape to go fly that system,\u201d NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich said last week.  But that may not be the end of it. Boeing revealed last week that it may ultimately have to redesign the valves. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of additional testing that we want to go do, and based on those results, we\u2019ll solidify what kind of changes we\u2019ll make in the future,\u201d Nappi said. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably know more in the coming months.\u201d If Boeing does move forward with a more extensive redesign of the valves, it\u2019s not clear how long that would take or if it could further delay Boeing\u2019s first astronaut mission, which, at this point, is years behind schedule. The hangups with Starliner have also cost the company about half a billion dollars, according to public documents. Meanwhile, SpaceX, once thought to be the underdog competitor in NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, has already launched five astronaut missions for NASA as well as two tourism missions. The inaugural astronaut launch of its vehicle, the Crew Dragon, became the first to carry astronauts to orbit from US soil since the Space Shuttle Program retired in 2011. ",

            "text": "Boeing is the world\u2019s largest aerospace company, a primary US defense contractor, and a titan of a global aviation duopoly. A few years ago, the idea that it would dominate commercial space was a given, and companies like SpaceX, a relatively young business relying on a strategy of moving fast and breaking things, would take a back seat to the move level-headed and experienced Boeing.  That, however, did not come to fruition.  Errors, delays and failures beleaguered the spacecraft\u2019s development. There was a botched test flight, software issues, sticky valves and a lawsuit involving an executive at a subcontractor who is said to have lost his leg during a Starliner test. After initially giving SpaceX closer scrutiny than Boeing, officials later said they regretted that as many of Starliner\u2019s issues slipped through the cracks. SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s relatively new entrant into the spaceflight business, ultimately beat Boeing to the launch pad. The company\u2019s Crew Dragon spacecraft has now logged five astronaut launches for NASA since it entered service in 2020. Meanwhile, Boeing is still trying to get through an uncrewed test flight. The company will make its second attempt this week, hoping a flawless performance will mend its image as the fallen star of human spaceflight. The controversies surrounding Starliner have also added to other woes within Boeing\u2019s commercial aircraft division that have chipped away at the company\u2019s formerly rock-solid image over the past several years. Here\u2019s a look back at Starliner\u2019s trying past. OFT-1 In 2014, NASA awarded fixed-price contracts \u2014 meaning the space agency would only pay the initial agreed-upon price and not a penny more \u2014 to Boeing and SpaceX. The move cemented their slots as the companies that would take NASA astronauts back to space under the Commercial Crew program. Boeing\u2019s awards totaled $4.2 billion, a significant markup compared to the $2.6 billion SpaceX was given, though the company has said that\u2019s because SpaceX had already received millions for development of an uncrewed version of its Dragon vehicle. Though both spacecrafts were expected to blast astronauts into space just a few years later, as the end of the decade neared, it became clear that SpaceX was outpacing Boeing. When the company\u2019s first uncrewed orbital flight test, dubbed OFT-1, reached the launch pad in December 2019, SpaceX had already beaten it by six months. And almost immediately after Starliner launched on December 20, 2019, it was clear something was wrong. Later, it was revealed that Starliner\u2019s internal clock was off by 11 hours, which caused the spacecraft to misfire and stumble off course, NASA and Boeing officials told reporters. Starliner was forced to make an early return to Earth.  Months later, a second serious software issue was revealed, with one government safety official saying it could have caused a \u201ccatastrophic failure.\u201d Boeing\n            \n                (BA) was able to identify and correct the error before it impacted Starliner\u2019s behavior, however.  Boeing agreed to fix the issues and pay for a second attempt at the uncrewed test flight, setting aside nearly half a billion dollars. Months of troubleshooting, safety reviews and investigations followed the test flight. Former astronaut pulls out of mission Former NASA astronaut Chris Ferguson, who left the government astronaut corps in 2011 to help Boeing design and build the Starliner, was slated to command the first crewed mission of Starliner as a private astronaut. But after the failure of its inaugural flight test, Ferguson announced he could no longer fly on the vehicle, citing scheduling conflicts.  NASA and Boeing made the announcement in late 2020, saying Ferguson made the decision for \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d Ferguson said in a follow-up tweet that he planned to prioritize his family, and he \u201cmade several commitments which I simply cannot risk missing.\u201d Though the crewed mission has been rescheduled several times, there do not appear to be plans to return Ferguson to the mission.  A NASA astronaut, Barry \u201cButch\u201d Wilmore, was assigned to take Ferguson\u2019s place. Sticky valves and Florida humidity Boeing believed it was ready to put Starliner back to the test last year, and it scheduled a second attempt at the orbital flight test \u2014 this one dubbed OFT-2 \u2014 for August.  More problems quickly arose. When the spacecraft was rolled out to its launch pad and began going through pre-flight ground checks, engineers discovered that key valves on the Starliner were sticking. Eventually Boeing announced that the problem could not be fixed on the launch pad, and the whole vehicle had to be rolled back to the assembly building for further troubleshooting. By mid-August, Boeing had given up trying to fix the issues on site. The Starliner had to be sent all the way back to Boeing\u2019s factory. In press conferences leading up to Thursday\u2019s test fight, Boeing officials revealed that they will fly OFT-2 this week with a \u201cshort-term\u201d fix in place, but the company may ultimately opt to redesign the valve system.  Other issues Adding to the questions surrounding Boeing\u2019s safety practices as Starliner heads back to the launch pad this week is a recent report from Reuters, which highlighted a previously overlooked lawsuit filed against Boeing last year by a subcontractor who was said to have his leg partially amputated after an accident that occurred ahead of a 2017 Starliner parachute test.  Boeing confirmed in a statement that a lawsuit was filed on behalf of the employee and the subcontractor. \u201cThe matter was settled by all of the parties; the terms of the settlement are confidential,\u201d the statement reads. Court documents confirm the matter was settled in December 2021.",

            "text": "Black box data recovered from a China Eastern flight that crashed in March suggests someone in the cockpit intentionally downed the plane, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a preliminary assessment from United States officials. The Boeing 737-800 was flying from Kunming to Guangzhou when it nosedived from 29,000 feet mid air into the mountains, killing all 132 passengers and crew on board. It was China\u2019s deadliest air disaster in decades. Information extracted from the plane\u2019s damaged flight-data recorder shows human input orders to the controls sent the plane into its deadly dive, according to the Journal, citing people familiar with the probe.  \u201cThe plane did what it was told to do by someone in the cockpit,\u201d the Journal quoted a person who is familiar with American officials\u2019 preliminary assessment as saying. The plane\u2019s flight-data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were recovered from the crash and sent to the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in Washington DC for analysis, Chinese state media earlier. American officials involved in the investigation are focusing on the actions of a pilot, the Journal reported, adding that it is also possible that someone else on the plane could have broken into the cockpit and deliberately caused the crash.  Chinese investigators have not revealed any mechanical or technical problems with the aircraft that could have caused the crash and might require further action across the industry \u2013 as is typical in such events \u2013 a fact American officials believe lends credibility to their assessment, the journal reported. CNN has reached out to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and China Eastern Airlines for comment. In a statement to the Journal, China Eastern said no evidence has emerged that could determine whether or not there were problems with the aircraft involved in the accident. The airline told the Journal that the pilots\u2019 health and family conditions were good, and added that their financial status was also in good shape. \u201cAny unofficial speculation may interfere with the accident investigation and affect the real progress of the global air transport industry,\u201d the airline told the Journal. On Wednesday, China\u2019s state-run newspaper the Global Times cited a statement from the CAAC, which said it had reached out to the NTSB investigators who denied \u201creleasing information on the investigation to any media outlets.\u201d According to the Global Times, the CAAC said the investigation is ongoing in a \u201cscientific and rigorous\u201d manner, and pledged to release \u201ctimely and accurate\u201d updates.  In a summary of its preliminary report released on April 20, the CAAC said the two black boxes were \u201cseverely damaged\u201d and \u201cthe data restoration and analysis work is still in progress.\u201d The report said the flight crew and maintenance personnel \u201cmet the relevant standards\u201d and there were no items on board that had been declared as dangerous goods, nor were there any forecasts of dangerous weather. Before the plane deviated from the cruising altitude, the radio communications between the crew and the air traffic control department did not show any abnormality, according to the report. Rumors about a copilot intentionally crashing the plane had circulated widely on China\u2019s internet by early April, with some pointing to the CAAC\u2019s remarks on the mental health of aviation staff following the crash. At a meeting on aviation safety on April 6, CAAC director Feng Zhenglin urged Communist Party officials at all levels to \u201cstabilize the thoughts of their teams, make utmost efforts to solve employees\u2019 problems in their work, life and study, and ensure their physical and mental health.\u201d \u201cIn particular, officials should do their best in the ideological work of pilots to lay a solid foundation for the front line to operate safely,\u201d Feng said. The speculations about pilot suicide causing the crash have previously prompted the CAAC to issue a denial. \u201cThese rumors\u2026have seriously misled the public and interfered with the investigation of the accident,\u201d Wu Shijie, a CAAC official, told a press conference on April 11, adding that police were carrying out investigations to hold the rumor mongers responsible.",

            "text": "JP Morgan Chase investors on Tuesday voted down a multimillion-dollar payout for CEO Jamie Dimon. The pay proposal they rejected included a massive $52.6 million retention bonus as part of Dimon\u2019s 2021 compensation package, just months after the bank\u2019s board approved the incentive. With the bonus, Dimon\u2019s total compensation was $84.4 million in 2021, up from $31.7 million in 2020.  But Dimon may yet get that payout. The compensation package is for 2021 and results of the \u201csay on pay\u201d votes are non-binding. Still, this is an embarrassing blow to the bank, not to mention Dimon himself, and JPMorgan\u2019s board said it takes investor feedback \u201cseriously.\u201d  The new compensation package was designed to keep Dimon at the helm of the bank for the next five years by awarding him 1.5 million stock options that vest in 2026. Shareholders also voted down a similar one-time $27.8 million special awards package for JPMorgan Chase COO Daniel Pinto. Less than a third of shareholders approved Dimon\u2019s pay package at the bank\u2019s annual meeting this week. That\u2019s the first time since 2009, when JPMorgan first began investor votes on executive compensation, that a majority voted against such a measure. Last year 90% of shareholders voted in favor of the bank\u2019s 2020 pay packages. The rejection suggests that shareholders may be unhappy with Dimon, who has led the bank since 2006 and guided JPMorgan through two recessions as it emerged to become  the biggest US bank by assets. Or maybe they thought the pay increase was just too high.  Two \u200b\u200bprominent proxy advisory firms, Glass, Lewis & Co. and Institutional Shareholder Services, campaigned heavily against the bonuses, arguing that the huge payday didn\u2019t line up with the bank\u2019s recent performance. JPMorgan shares are down more than 25% in 2022, and are performing worst among the large US banks.  \u201cExcessive one-off grants to the CEO and COO amid tepid relative performance worsen longstanding concerns regarding the company\u2019s executive pay program,\u201d Glass, Lewis & Co. wrote in a report to shareholders. \u201cThe lack of performance-based vesting conditions tied to the awards while the Company has not achieved adequate alignment between executive pay and performance warrants shareholders scrutiny,\u201d they wrote.  A JPMorgan spokesperson said after the vote that the compensation package was a rare one-time payment meant to reflect \u201cexemplary leadership.\u201d  Goldman Sachs\u2019s 2021 pay package, meanwhile, included a one-time bonus of $50 million for CEO David Solomon and passed with almost 82% shareholder approval. Goldman stock is down about 22% in 2022. ",

            "text": "AerCap Holdings, the aircraft leasing giant that is the world\u2019s largest owner of jets, lost 113 planes when Russia seized them in response to sanctions triggered by the war in Ukraine. The seizures of the planes and 11 jet engines by Russian authorities caused AerCap to take a $2.7 billion pre-tax charge during the quarter, causing the company to report a net loss of $2 billion rather than the $500 million profit it would have made without the hit. But company executives said the quarter was actually a good one and they see better times ahead as global demand for flying continues to recover from the Covid pandemic. \u201cBut for the impact of Russia, this is a strong underlying quarter for the company,\u201d said CEO Aengus Kelly in comments to analysts. \u201cAcross all our business lines \u2026 we are seeing improving demand, increased utilization of our assets and the improving financial health of our customers.\u201d Investors agreed and shares of Dublin-based AerCap gained 6% in afternoon trading following the report. The company was able to recover 22 jets and 3 engines before they were seized by Russian authorities. It has filed insurance claims to seek to recover the lost aircraft, although some of those claims are with Russian insurance companies. Those policies are backed by Western re-insurance companies, but AerCap stated that \u201cthe timing and amount of any recoveries under these policies are uncertain.\u201d The company owns a total of 1,624 aircraft, far more than owned or operated any single airline. The jets lost to Russia represented less than 5% of the net value of Aercap\u2019s fleet, which grew larger during the pandemic by purchasing rival leasing firm GECAS from General Electric\n            \n                (GE). Aercap should easily ride out the financial loss of the jets, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director with AeroDynamic Advisory. Even if the war were to end and the sanctions were to be lifted, the planes have lost their operating certificates in the eyes of Western aviation regulators. \u201cOnce the documentation goes, there\u2019s very little point in even trying to get them back,\u201d he said. When Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, Russia\u2019s air carriers were operating 861 commercial planes, according to data from aviation analytics firm Cirium. Just over half of those planes, with an estimated market value of $9.2 billion, were owned by non-Russian leasing companies.  Sanctions by multiple countries required international aircraft leasing companies that owned  the jets to repossess them by the end of March. An estimated 79 jets were repossessed, but Russia announced it was nationalizing hundreds more.",

            "text": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway has been a top investor in Wells Fargo for the past few years, despite the company\u2019s fake account scandal, overcharging foreign-exchange customers and myriad other problems.  Now, the Oracle of Omaha has finally thrown in the towel. Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKB) disclosed late Monday that it sold its remaining stake in Wells Fargo\n            \n                (WFC) during the first quarter, according to the conglomerate\u2019s latest filing of holdings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shares of Wells Fargo\n            \n                (WFC) rallied with other bank stocks Tuesday, however.  Berkshire still owned a tiny stake in Wells Fargo as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, but had been cutting the position gradually since 2019. Many Berkshire investors had been pressuring the company to sell all its holdings in the bank, arguing that its continuing problems were a stain on Berkshire.  Critics of Wells Fargo often cited Buffett\u2019s comments during a 1991 congressional hearing  about issues with Wall Street investment bank Salomon Brothers. Buffett was an investor in Salomon at the time and later became its chairman following a bond trading scandal that led to the ouster of several top executives.  \u201cLose money for the firm, and I will be understanding; lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless,\u201d Buffett said during the hearing. Berkshire may now be done with Wells Fargo, but the company is still invested in many other big banks and financial firms. Bank of America\n            \n                (BAC) and American Express\n            \n                (AXP) are currently two of Berkshire\u2019s top four stock holdings. Buffett\u2019s company also owns insurance giant Geico and several other financial services subsidiaries. Berkshire also made a new purchase of more than 55 million shares in Wells Fargo rival Citigroup\n            \n                (C) during the first quarter, a stake worth about $3 billion as of the end of the quarter. Shares of Citigroup\n            \n                (C) surged nearly 8% on the news. Berkshire bought a smaller stake in Ally Financial\n            \n                (ALLY) during the quarter. Buffett runs the portfolio with two other top Berkshire investment managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, who is also the CEO of Geico. This triumvirate is shaking up Berkshire\u2019s investments. In addition to its stakes in Citigroup and Ally, Berkshire also bought new positions in CBS owner Paramount Global, chemicals company Celanese\n            \n                (CE), healthcare giant McKesson\n            \n                (MCK) and insurer Markel\n            \n                (MKL) during the quarter. Shares of all four stocks were up Tuesday, with Paramount soaring 14% and Celanese\n            \n                (CE) gaining 8%. Berkshire slashed its position in telecom giant Verizon\n            \n                (VZ) as well and now only holds a small stake in the firm. Verizon\n            \n                (VZ)\u2019s stock was flat.  Berkshire also confirmed some previously disclosed investments in the SEC filing that Buffett discussed at Berkshire\u2019s shareholder meeting at the end of April, including a boost to its stakes in oil giants Chevron\n            \n                (CVX) and Occidental Petroleum\n            \n                (OXY) and a bigger bet on Activision Blizzard\n            \n                (ATVI), the video game maker that Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT) plans to buy.",

At the Red Bull Paper Wings World Final on May 14, one competitor threw a paper airplane 200.49 feet \u2013 almost the length of six school buses placed end-to-end.  Held in Hangar-7 at Salzburg Airport, the event is the official paper airplane world championships and consists of three categories: longest distance, longest airtime and aerobatics.  The distance and airtime pilots constructed their planes by folding a single, standardized sheet of A4 paper provided by organizers. The rules dictate that there can be no other modifications such as cutting, tearing, gluing or stapling. For the aerobatics event, however, multiple types of paper planes are permitted with no restrictions on size, paper quality or construction technique. Lazar Krsti\u0107 \u2013 winner of the distance category \u2013 avenged his second-place finish in 2019. Since then, he has been determined to take victory, spending the intervening three years redesigning his plane, refining his throwing technique, and even adding over 20 pounds of muscle to his physique for extra power and strength. Yicheng Sun of Great Britain finished second with a throw of 187.4 feet. Rana Muhammad Usman Saeed from Pakistan won the airtime event with a flight of 14.86 seconds, nearly two seconds longer than second-placed Esteban Neira of Chile.  The aerobatics category was assessed more subjectively by a judging panel which awarded points based on creativity, overall flight performance and technical proficiency.  South Korea\u2019s Lee Seunghoon was victorious in this discipline thanks to his minute-long routine featuring magician-like choreography and gravity-defying planes that twisted and twirled mid-air.

            "text": "The CEO of Ryanair let loose a scathing, obscenity-laden attack on Boeing management Monday, saying company executives need either an immediate \u201creboot, or a boot up the a**.\u201d \u201cAt the moment we think Boeing management is running around like headless chickens, not able to sell aircraft, and then even the aircraft they deliver, they\u2019re not able to deliver them on time,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Leary, CEO of Ryanair, Europe\u2019s largest discount carrier, which has ordered nearly 400 jets from Boeing since 2010. O\u2019Leary and Boeing had an unusually public dispute last fall about negotiations on a possible order for the next generation of the 737 Max, with Ireland-based Ryanair breaking off talks because of a pricing squabble.  The CEO\u2019s unusually blunt comments Monday were focused on Boeing\u2019s delayed deliveries of planes. O\u2019Leary said Ryanair had to scale back its spring and summer schedules because planes it had expected the aircraft maker to deliver by the end of April probably won\u2019t arrive until the end of June.  He was livid about the delays, especially because Ryanair is purchasing planes known as white tails, which Boeing had built for other airlines. The original purchaser of those planes canceled the order during a prolonged 20-month grounding of the 737 Max that followed two fatal crashes. \u201cI can understand why there may be various challenges manufacturing new aircraft, but aircraft that you built and made two years ago that all you had \u2026 to do was put petrol in them and f***ing fly them to Dublin, really I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re taking two to three month delays on that,\u201d he said on a conference call with investors about the airline\u2019s financial results. \u201cIt is redolent of very poor management performance in Seattle.\u201d Boeing declined to comment on O\u2019Leary\u2019s remarks.  Criticizing management O\u2019Leary said Boeing makes great planes, but it might be time to change management. \u201cEither the existing management needs to up its game, or they need to change the existing management, would be our view of life,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy to work with existing management but they need to bloody well improve on what they\u2019ve been doing delivering to us over the last 12 months. \u2026 We\u2019re a willing customer, but we\u2019re struggling with slow deliveries and an inability to do a deal on new aircraft despite the number of white tails they have sitting on the f***ing ground in Seattle.\u201d Boeing has faced numerous problems in recent years, including the 737 Max crisis that cost it more than $20 billion. The company also was hit with an FAA-ordered halt of deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner last June due to quality control problems. And it faced delays winning approval for its next-generation widebody jet, the 777X, that forced Boeing to push back the first deliveries of the plane by two years to at least 2025.  Boeing also took substantial losses in its military and space businesses, including a recent $660 million charge on the two planes it is completing that will be used as the new Air Force Ones. It\u2019s also combating delays in building a spacecraft to carry US astronauts to the International Space Station. \u201cIf they get their s*** together, we\u2019d be willing to take more aircraft for summer \u201923 and summer \u201824,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cThere\u2019s growth there to be won.\u201d  He also said the airline is willing to restart negotiations on an order for the new generation of the 737 Max, although he pointed out that has yet to win FAA approval, making it risky to depend upon. So Ryanair is also looking at possibly purchasing 50 jets on the second hand market instead. And he had choice words for Boeing\u2019s sales staff. \u201cYou wonder what the hell their sales team has done in the last two years,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cFrankly most of them seem to sitting at home in their f***ing jimjams working from home instead of being out there selling planes to customers.\u201d O\u2019Leary also criticized Boeing\u2019s recently announced plan to move its corporate headquarters from Chicago to Arlington, Virginia, a suburb of Washington. \u201cMoving the headquarters to Virginia from Chicago, while it may be good for the defense side of the business, doesn\u2019t fix the fundamental underlying problems on the civilian aircraft side in Seattle,\u201d he said. Other customer criticism In addition to O\u2019Leary, several other airlines have complained on recent conference calls \u2014 although in far less colorful language \u2014 about the problems they face from the 787 or 777X delays. Domhnal Slattery, the CEO of Avolon, one of the world\u2019s leading aircraft leasing companies, suggested earlier this month that Boeing needs a change in culture \u2014 and maybe leadership. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that Boeing has lost its way,\u201d Slattery said at the Airfinance Journal conference, in comments first reported by Reuters and confirmed by Avolon. \u201cBoeing has a storied history \u2026 They build great airplanes. But it\u2019s said that culture eats strategy for breakfast and that is what has happened at Boeing.\u201d",

            "text": "JetBlue is going hostile in its effort to acquire Spirit\n            \n                (SAVE), the latest twist in an industry battle for the low-cost carrier. Spirit previously rejected a takeover offer from JetBlue\n            \n                (JBLU), favoring an earlier deal to merge with fellow budget airline Frontier.   Now, JetBlue is appealing directly to Spirit\u2019s shareholders, urging them to vote against the Frontier deal while launching its own all-cash offer of $30 per share. JetBlue said in a statement Monday that its offer represented a \u201c60% premium to the value of the Frontier transaction.\u201d The airline added that it was willing to negotiate a $33-per-share deal if Spirit agrees to provide information about its business that JetBlue claims has been withheld.  \u201cThe Spirit Board failed to provide us the necessary diligence information it had provided Frontier and then summarily rejected our proposal, which addressed its regulatory concerns, without asking us even a single question about it,\u201d JetBlue said in a letter addressed to Spirit shareholders. \u201cThe Spirit Board based its rejection on unsupportable claims that are easily refuted.\u201d Spirit\u2019s rejection Spirit rejected a $33 a share cash offer from JetBlue on April 2, saying that it didn\u2019t believe a merger with the company would be cleared by regulators, and that \u201cgiven this substantial completion risk, we believe JetBlue\u2019s economic offer is illusory.\u201d Instead, the Spirit board said it was sticking with a cash and stock deal it reached in January with Frontier. That deal was valued at that time at $25.83 for each Spirit share. But Frontier shares have since fallen. Shares of Frontier were slightly higher in premarket trading Monday on news of JetBlue\u2019s hostile takeover attempt, but even with the rise, its offer for Spirit is worth less than $20 a share. Shares of Spirit were also higher on the JetBlue news, while JetBlue shares were narrowly lower. Spirit did not immediate reply to a request for comment. Creating a bigger competitor If Spirit and Frontier were to combine, the new airline would leapfrog JetBlue\n            \n                (JBLU) and Alaska Air\n            \n                (ALK) in the number of miles flown by paying passengers, according to 2021 statistics, putting it behind the four major airlines that control about 80% of the nation\u2019s air traffic \u2014 American, Delta\n            \n                (DAL), United\n            \n                (UAL) and Southwest Airlines\n            \n                (LUV).  Both Spirit and Frontier operate as ultra low-cost carriers, with very low base fares and extra charges for just about anything else a passenger needs, including carry-on baggage.  They depend much more on bargain-hunting leisure travelers, and carry fewer business travelers than their larger rivals. Spirit argues that the fact that JetBlue charges higher fares on average than Spirit or Frontier is another reason that regulators are unlikely to accept a deal. \u201cSpirit believes that merging with Frontier will enable the combined ultra-low cost carrier business to achieve scale, improve operational reliability, have increased relevance to consumers, and do an even better job of delivering ultra-low fares to more consumers and competing more effectively against the Big Four carriers, as well as against JetBlue,\u201d Spirit said two weeks ago when it rejected JetBlue.  But JetBlue argued at that time that its fares are lower than those on the four major airlines, and when it enters a new route, fares for the major carriers are cut by about 16% because of the competition.  The company said that is greater than the reduction in fares by the big four when either Spirit or Frontier enter a market. Spirit\u2019s reputation Although passengers might like low fares, many don\u2019t like the experience of flying with the low-cost airlines. Spirit had by far the highest number of complaints, with 13.25 complaints per 100,000 passengers,   from January through September 2021, according to the US Department of Transportation. JetBlue had the second most complaints on that basis with 6.85, while Frontier had the third most in the industry with 5.76. Frontier had by far the worst rate of complaints in the same period of 2020, when it recorded 60.24 complaints per 100,000 customers.  Frontier and Spirit also had the industry\u2019s worst customer satisfaction ratings, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Meanwhile JetBlue scored at the top or near the top in customer satisfaction rankings in different categories of travelers in a recent survey of 7,000 airline passengers by JD Power. Antitrust concerns The Biden administration has been much more active in challenging mergers and other combinations with the stated goal of promoting greater competition. For example, JetBlue recently entered into an alliance with American Airlines that allows the two carriers to book passengers on each other\u2019s flights. In September, the Justice Department sued to end the agreement, saying it was bad for competition and airfares in the Northeast.  Both American and JetBlue have argued that passengers benefit from the agreement and are fighting the suit. Spirit argues that as long as JetBlue\u2019s alliance with American remains in place, there is no chance that JetBlue would be allowed by regulators to buy Spirit.",

All 113 passengers and nine crew members were \u201cevacuated safely,\u201d the airline said in a statement. More than 40 passengers with minor injuries were taken to hospital, according to a statement from the Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said 36 people suffered bruises and sprains during the evacuation.  \u201cAccording to the flight crew, the plane experienced an anomaly during takeoff. They stopped the takeoff following the procedures,\u201d the CAAC said. \u201cAfter the plane skidded off the runway, the engine scraped the ground and caught fire. (The fire) has been extinguished.\u201d The flight was bound for Nyingchi in Tibet. Footage posted on Chinese social media shows flames engulfing the front of the aircraft and a plume of black smoke billowing in the sky. Another video shows passengers running from the airplane. The cause of the accident is under investigation and flight operations at the airport have returned to normal, the airport said. The flight schedule shows the aircraft is an Airbus A319 that had been in service with the airline for nine and a half years. The incident came less than two months after a China Eastern Airlines jetliner carrying 132 people crashed in the mountains of southern China\u2019s Guangxi region, killing everyone on board. Authorities are still investigating the cause of the crash.",

It was, he stressed, a \u201cserious situation.\u201d Air Traffic Controller Robert Morgan, a certified flight instructor, was on a break when the call came in from the plane, headed out from the Bahamas.  \u201cI rush over there and I walk in and the room is really busy \u2026 and they\u2019re like, \u2018Hey, this pilot\u2019s incapacitated.

            "title": "Boeing clashes with key supplier ahead of Starliner spacecraft launch",
            "text": "Boeing Co. is feuding with Aerojet Rocketdyne, a key supplier for its Starliner spacecraft, as the U.S. aerospace giant races to test launch the uncrewed astronaut capsule and mend its reputation in the space sector, people familiar with the matter said. The CST-100 Starliner is scheduled for a May 19 Florida launch atop an Atlas 5 rocket to the International Space Station, with Boeing aiming to show NASA that the spacecraft is safe to ferry astronauts to and from the orbiting outpost. Software failures cut short a similar 2019 uncrewed test flight. The mission is a crucial step toward re-establishing Boeing as a viable rival to billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, a drive complicated by Boeing\u2019s disagreement with propulsion system supplier Aerojet, according to three people who spoke on condition of anonymity. Chicago-based Boeing\n            \n                (BA) (BA) and El Segundo, California-based Aerojet (ARJD) are at odds over the cause of a problem involving fuel valves in the Starliner propulsion system that forced a postponement of a test flight last July, with the two companies faulting one another, the sources said. The disagreement, which has not been reported before, comes at time when Boeing already is scrambling to emerge from successive crises that have hobbled its jetliner business and drained cash. The Aerojet dispute is the latest illustration of Boeing\u2019s struggles with Starliner, a program costing the company $595 million in charges since 2019. Facing fixed-price NASA contracts that leave Boeing with little wiggle room financially, the company has pressed forward with the Starliner test. Boeing in a statement provided by a spokesperson to Reuters acknowledged for the first time that it ultimately intends to redesign Starliner\u2019s valve system to prevent a repeat of the issue that forced last year\u2019s test-flight postponement. The Boeing statement said that \u201cwe are working on short- and long-term design changes to the valves.\u201d Thirteen fuel valves that are part of a propulsion system that helps steer Starliner in space were discovered stuck and unresponsive in the closed position, prompting last year\u2019s postponement. The various technical setbacks have pushed Starliner\u2019s first flight with people aboard into an unknown future, placing it far behind Musk\u2019s SpaceX, whose Crew Dragon capsule, developed under the same NASA program as Starliner, has already flown five astronaut crews for the U.S. space agency. NASA hopes Boeing can provide additional options to carry astronauts to the space station. NASA in March awarded SpaceX three more missions to make up for Boeing\u2019s delays. A team of Boeing and NASA engineers is in general agreement that the cause of the stuck valves involves a chemical reaction between propellant, aluminum materials and the intrusion of moisture from Starliner\u2019s humid Florida launch site. Aerojet engineers and lawyers see it differently, blaming a cleaning chemical that Boeing has used in ground tests, two of the sources said. An Aerojet representative declined to comment. \u2018ROOT CAUSE\u2019 \u201cTesting to determine root cause of the valve issue is complete,\u201d Boeing said in its statement, and the work did not find the problems described by Aerojet. NASA shares that view, Steve Stich, who oversees the Boeing and SpaceX crew programs for the space agency, told Reuters. Boeing also said Aerojet did not meet its contractual requirements to make the propulsion system resilient enough to resist the problems caused by the chemical reactions. Boeing last week wheeled Starliner back to the launch pad for a third time ahead of the upcoming launch, having swapped out the propulsion system for a new one with a temporary fix that prevents moisture from seeping into the valve section. Boeing and NASA said they did not recreate any fully stuck valves during nine months of testing, instead measuring the degree to which valves struggled to open. This approach was used in order to get Starliner back to the launchpad quickly, two of the sources said. NASA, Boeing, Aerojet and independent safety advisers are set to meet this week to reach a final determination on the cause of the valve problems and decide whether the temporary fix will work. Boeing officials privately regard Aerojet\u2019s explanation for the faulty valves as a bid to deflect responsibility for the costly delay for Starliner and to avoid paying for a redesigned valve system, two of the sources said. \u201cIt\u2019s laughable,\u201d one person involved in the joint Boeing-NASA investigation of the value issue said of Aerojet\u2019s claim, speaking anonymously to discuss confidential supplier relations. \u201cGetting a valve maker or propulsion system provider to write down, \u2018Yeah, I screwed that up\u2019 \u2026 that\u2019s never gonna happen.\u201d After testing and software issues caused Starliner\u2019s 2019 failure to dock at the space station, NASA officials acknowledged they had trusted Boeing too much when they decided to devote more engineering oversight to the newer SpaceX than the aerospace giant. The feud with Aerojet is not Boeing\u2019s first Starliner subcontractor quarrel. In 2017, Starliner had an accident during a ground test that forced the president of a different subcontractor to have his leg medically amputated. The subcontractor sued, and Boeing subsequently settled the case.",

            "text": "The airports are crowded, the flights are packed and air travel in the US and beyond is back in full swing. But the return to the skies in the wake of the pandemic hasn\u2019t been entirely smooth: passengers seem more badly behaved than ever, flight cancellations feel increasingly commonplace and airlines are hiking fares as fuel prices soar. Perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that North American airplane passenger satisfaction is declining across the board, at least according to consumer research company J.D. Power\u2019s 2022 North American Airline Satisfaction Study. J.D. Power\u2019s report suggests that customers are frustrated by ticket cost, flight crew performance and even the aircraft they\u2019re traveling on \u2013 and that\u2019s true whether they opt to travel economy, premium economy or business. The study finds overall North American airline passenger satisfaction at 798 out of 1,000, down over 20 points from last year\u2019s report. Still, certain airlines have come out on top in the report. Economy passengers rated Southwest Airlines highest with 849 points, while JetBlue triumphed in premium economy (851 points) and first/business (878 points). Michael Taylor, travel intelligence lead at J.D. Power, said the overall decline in North American passenger satisfaction isn\u2019t \u201cbad news,\u201d suggesting airlines could learn from the results to improve their offerings. \u201cIf airlines can find ways to manage these growing volumes while making some small adjustments to help passengers feel more valued, they should be able to manage this return to \u2018normal,\u2019\u201d said Taylor in a statement.  A new era of flying  Last year\u2019s North American Airline Satisfaction Study results indicated travelers were enjoying some of the unexpected benefits of pandemic-era flights: fewer passengers, emptier flights and ticket flexibility. Taylor suggested that the comparison between those height-of-Covid flights and travel today was behind this year\u2019s drop in satisfaction. \u201cFewer passengers meant more space on airplanes, less waiting in line and more attention from flight attendants. But that business model was simply not sustainable,\u201d he said.  Equally, the report suggests there are some leftovers from pandemic flying that passengers would rather see the back of. J.D. Power draws a link between a decrease in food and beverage satisfaction in premium economy and business and the fact that many airlines didn\u2019t serve alcohol on board for much of last year. As well as food and beverage options, the North America Airline Satisfaction Study also examined how happy passengers were with aircraft, baggage, boarding, check-in, cost and fees, flight crew, in-flight services and reservations. Some 7,004 airplane passengers were surveyed from March 2021 through March 2022. J.D. Power\u2019s top North American airlines for economy passengers 1. Southwest Airlines 2. JetBlue Airways 3.

            "text": "Boeing is moving its headquarters from Chicago to a suburb of Washington, DC. But some analysts think this move is one in the wrong direction. Boeing was based in Seattle from its founding in 1916 to 2001. During its heyday it was renowned as an engineering-driven company that made the best, safest planes. But many industry watchers felt that reputation was lost as Boeing shifted to focus on the bottom line \u2014 and they point to its 2001 decision to move headquarters from Seattle to Chicago as a stark sign of that ill-advised shift. The company\u2019s Thursday announcement that it will move once again, to Arlington, Virginia, only gives critics more fuel: By moving into the shadow of both the Pentagon and Congress, Boeing seems to be signaling it has lost the commercial race to Airbus and wants to be seen as primarily a defense and space contractor. The fact that the announcement comes the same week Airbus\n            \n                (EADSF) revealed it\u2019s increasing production of commercial jets at its factory in Mobile, Alabama, only seems to drive home that point. \u201cOne company is saying \u2018We\u2019re going to build lots of jets.\u2019 The other is saying \u2018We\u2019re going to lobby the Pentagon and Congress for defense dollars.\u2019 It\u2019s a big contrast,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory and a leading aerospace analyst. Boeing said in a press release that the Arlington move is designed to bring the company closer to its \u201ccustomers and stakeholders, and its access to world-class engineering and technical talent.\u201d \u2018The road not taken\u2019 Aboulafia isn\u2019t surprised Boeing decided to move its headquarters to Arlington, but he is disappointed. A move back to the Seattle area  would have sent a strong signal that Boeing is was once again ready to embrace engineering, he added. \u201cIt would have been great for morale and shown an intent to focus on their badly neglected commercial airline products,\u201d said Aboulafia. \u201cImagine the power if they said \u2018We\u2019re going to back to our roots.\u2019 It\u2019s just disappointing. It\u2019s the road not taken.\u201d Boeing\u2019s engineering and quality problems have posed major challenges for the company. The crashes of two of 737 Max jets that killed all 346 people on board the flights led to a crippling 20-month grounding of the plane. It also was one of the most expensive corporate blunders in history, costing Boeing in excess of $20 billion. But it\u2019s had problems, delays and financial charges for just about all of its other passenger jets too. While the Max is now back in the air carrying passengers in most markets around the globe, that hasn\u2019t solved perhaps its most serious problem: It\u2019s has fallen well behind Airbus in commercial plane sales and deliveries, particularly among single-aisle jets.  Cozying up to the Pentagon and Congress could help Boeing in its defense and space businesses, but even in those fields it\u2019s struggling to keep up with other defense contractors like Lockheed\n            \n                (LMT) and Raytheon\n            \n                (RTN), as well as upstart space companies such as SpaceX. Plus, moving to suburban DC doesn\u2019t get Boeing many benefits, said Ron Epstein, aerospace analyst for Bank of America. The company already has nearly 100 lobbyists and a lobbying budget of $13.4 million a year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 Open Secrets website, which tracks lobbying. That\u2019s the fifth most of any individual company. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would accuse Boeing of not having enough presence in DC,\u201d said Epstein. \u201cWhen I saw the announcement, it was a bit of a head-scratcher. You have to ask, what does that get them?\u201d It\u2019s not just analysts and critics in the media who are questioning Boeing\u2019s culture. Last week, Domhnal Slattery, the CEO of Avolon, one of the world\u2019s leading aircraft leasing companies and a major Boeing customer, suggested the company needs a change in culture \u2014 and maybe leadership.  \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that Boeing has lost its way,\u201d he said at the Airfinance Journal conference in Dublin on Thursday, in comments first reported by Reuters. \u201cBoeing has a storied history\u2026They build great airplanes. But it\u2019s said that culture eats strategy for breakfast and that is what has happened at Boeing.\u201d A spokesman for Avolon confirmed the comments, although he cautioned that Slattery wasn\u2019t speaking specifically about Boeing\u2019s headquarters decision. Rep. Peter DeFazio, the Oregon Democrat who chairs the House Transportation Committee, also blasted Boeing\u2019s move. \u201cMoving their headquarters to Chicago and away from their roots in the Pacific Northwest was a tragic mistake that\u2026 empowered Wall Street bean-counters over the line engineers who built their once-great reputation,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cBoeing\u2019s problem isn\u2019t a lack of access to government, but rather its ongoing production problems and the failures of management and the board that led to the fatal crashes of the 737 Max.\u201d \u201cBoeing should focus on making safe airplanes \u2014 not lobbying federal regulators and Congress,\u201d he concluded. Some of the company\u2019s problems \u2014 particularly the body blow it caused to airlines\u2019 finances and demand for new planes \u2014 were beyond Boeing\u2019s control. Even Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun admits most of the problems have been self-inflicted. \u201cI will be the first to admit that they were not events caused by the outside world, but unfortunately, missteps inside,\u201d he told investors in a January conference call. Still, he insisted Boeing has taken steps to improve its attention to engineering. \u201cOur culture is focused on getting as close to our work as we possibly can from the very top of the company through the engineering rank,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting much better. In fact, we\u2019re getting really good at it.\u201d Beyond the Max and the pandemic, however, Boeing has other problems to solve. Quality control issues with its widebody 787 Dreamliner has forced delivery to be on hold for nearly a year. And certification problems for its newest widebody, the 777X, has pushed back its planned first delivery of the passenger version by two years, to at least 2025. Meanwhile, Boeing\u2019s attempts to fix all of its problems with the Max, the 777X and Dreamliner has taken time and attention away from its original plan to come up with a new long-range single-aisle jet to compete with the hot selling Airbus A321XLR.  \u201cPretty much every single one of their programs has taken a [financial] charge, and that\u2019s across both commercial and defense,\u201d said Epstein. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing to do, to design and build aircraft.  Nobody\u2019s perfect. But Boeing seems to have more warts on their programs than all of their peers. It all goes back to engineering. Is moving to Arlington changing the engineering culture in a good way? It\u2019s hard to see.\u201d ",

Officials responded to a report of a small-engine aircraft crash less than 10 miles from Houston\u2019s Hobby Airport around 4 p.m. \u201cFour civilians were aboard the aircraft at the time of the crash, all self-extricated, with no injuries reported,\u201d the Houston Fire Department said on Twitter. \u201cHouston Fire received reports of a gazebo on fire. [Firefighters] arrived on scene quickly & extinguished the fire.\u201d The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) told CNN in a statement the plane, a twin-engine Cessna 421, crashed after departing from Hobby Airport at around 2:45 p.m. The plane, which is registered in Mexico, was headed to San Antonio International Airport, according to the statement. Lalo Gonzalez was supposed to leave for a trip on Friday when he got a call from his brother-in-law telling him to rush over to his house. Gonzalez discovered a small plane had crashed just a couple of feet from his home. \u201cThe turbine engine and the small plane landed about 13 feet from my home\u2019s back wall,\u201d he told CNN.  Aerial images captured by CNN affiliate KHOU showed the plane in a neighbor\u2019s backyard with a smashed wing, which had torn through a fence. Houston firefighters could be seen dousing flames in the gazebo. In photos taken by Gonzalez, the plane can be seen looking largely intact with a charred turbine engine. Initially, authorities would not allow Gonzalez into his home, which lost electricity, water and gas after the crash, he said. Once police let him and his wife enter for their belongings, they discovered the damage caused by the plane. \u201cMy fence, the patio and all the lawn chairs are damaged,\u201d he said, adding a neighbor\u2019s whirlpool spa was \u201ccompletely burned.\u201d The National Transportation Safety Board will oversee the investigation and will provide additional updates, the FFA said.",

Under Armour \n            \n                (UA)tumbled 25% Friday after the company posted a $60 million loss during its most recent quarter due to supply chain delays and recent Covid-19 lockdowns in China. Chinese authorities imposed a lockdown in Shanghai, China\u2019s financial hub, in late March following a surge in coronavirus cases. Although the government started to lift some restrictions last month, more than 8 million residents are still banned from leaving their residential compounds. Under Armour warned that pressures in Asia will continue to hurt its business this year.  \u201cThese trends, which we believe to be temporary, are also expected to impact how [2022] is shaping up,\u201d Under Armour CEO Patrik Frisk said on an earnings call with analysts Friday. Meanwhile, Adidas\n            \n                (ADDDF) on Friday also said its profit fell last quarter. The sportswear giant reported a net profit of $327 million last quarter, down 38% from the same stretch a year ago. Adidas said the decline was caused by a \u201cchallenging market environment\u201d in China, where sales fell 35%, as well as supply chain disruptions. \u201cRevenues in Greater China are now expected to decline significantly in 2022,\u201d Adidas said. The company\u2019s stock fell 5% Friday. Under Armour\u2019s and Adidas\u2019 sluggish results and forecast dragged down other big sportswear brands, including Nike\n            \n                (NKE) and Lululemon\n            \n                (LULU). Nike\n            \n                (NKE) was off 3% and Lululemon\n            \n                (LULU) dropped 7% Friday. China is a key market for these companies and their supply chain networks also rely heavily on the Asia-Pacific region. Although these brands have been raising prices to combat higher costs, they say consumers are still eager to buy their gear. \u201cThe underlying demand for the brand is there. The brand is getting stronger,\u201d said Under Armour\u2019s Frisk. \u2014 CNN Business\u2019 Anna Cooban contributed to this article.",

            "title": "This solar-powered plane could stay in the air for months",
            "text": "In 2016, a bizarre-looking plane, covered with more than 17,000 solar panels, showed the world a glimpse of the future of flight. With the wingspan of a Boeing 747, but weighing only as much as an SUV, it circumnavigated the Earth without using a drop of fuel.  Called Solar Impulse 2, it was the brainchild of Swiss explorer Bertrand Piccard and Swiss engineer Bertrand Borschberg, built to showcase the potential of renewable energy. After its record-breaking flight, it had accomplished its goal \u2013 but now it\u2019s getting a new lease of life. In 2019 it was bought by Skydweller Aero, a US-Spanish startup which aims to turn the plane into the world\u2019s first commercially viable \u201cpseudo-satellite,\u201d capable of doing the work of an orbiting satellite, but with more flexibility and less environmental impact.  \u201cA pseudo-satellite is an aircraft that stays aloft, let\u2019s say, indefinitely,\u201d says Skydweller\u2019s CEO, Robert Miller. \u201cThat means 30, 60, 90 days \u2013 maybe a year. And as such, it can do basically anything you would imagine a satellite can do.\u201d That includes providing telecommunications and Earth imaging, as well as disaster response and monitoring natural resources.   Cheaper and greener  Using an aircraft for such applications is more flexible and cheaper, because satellites are expensive to build and have to be launched into orbit via a rocket, generally powered by fossil fuels. It\u2019s also more sustainable, because satellites have limited lifespans and eventually get decommissioned, often adding to the problem of space junk. Recent research found that large constellations of satellites could damage the ozone layer by releasing chemicals as they burn on re-entry into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.   After buying Solar Impulse 2, Skydweller spent months modifying it and flew it again for the first time in November 2020. Since then, it has completed 12 test flights, in the sunny weather of southeastern Spain. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of turning it into a drone,\u201d says Miller. \u201cThe pilot is still there for safety, but we now have the ability to fly the aircraft totally autonomously.\u201d   Take-offs and landings are still handled by the pilot, but Miller says the next step is adding systems that will make them automatic. \u201cAfter that, we can remove the pilot from the aircraft. We\u2019re in the process of beginning construction of a second aircraft that has no cockpit at all,\u201d he adds. Removing pilot and cockpit makes room for larger payloads, and is a necessary step to allow the plane to fly for weeks or months (Solar Impulse 2\u2019s longest flight was just under five days).  Miller says that the aircraft could be deployed as early as 2023, and that he believes there will be a market for a fleet of thousands. Companies like Facebook and Google have tested pseudo-satellites in the past, but without ever developing a commercial product.  \u201cThere will certainly be increasing demand for the type of services Skydweller provides,\u201d says Jeremiah Gertler, an aviation analyst at aerospace and defense market analysis company Teal Group. \u201cWhile others are offering similar and different solutions to high altitude and long endurance missions, there is a clear advantage to being the first ant at the picnic.\u201d Monitoring the oceans  As was the case with satellites, the project is attracting early interest for governmental and military applications. The US Navy has invested $5 million in Skydweller to investigate the aircraft\u2019s ability to perform maritime patrols, for which it currently employs drones that can reportedly fly no longer than 30 hours, and the Defense Innovation Unit \u2013 a Defense organization that seeks emerging technology for the US military \u2013 has awarded Skydweller a $14 million contract. Miller, however, says he sees Skydweller as eventually being \u201cmuch more commercial than government-oriented.\u201d Many of its potential applications have environmental benefits, including monitoring the use of natural resources \u2013 for example, scouting the ocean for illegal fishing or for oil leaks from deep sea drilling operations. \u201cThere are ways to do that with remote sensing from an aircraft, but it\u2019s extremely difficult to do it from a satellite,\u201d Miller says.   Telecommunications are likely to be a key use for Skydweller, because using the aircraft to provide internet or cellular access could be economically viable where satellite or traditional infrastructure would not be.  Last November, the company announced a partnership with Telefonica, one of the world\u2019s largest mobile network providers, to develop connectivity solutions that can offer cellular coverage in unserved or underserved regions around the world. Skydweller would operate as a \u201ccell tower in the sky,\u201d with no physical or carbon footprint. It could also provide temporary communications infrastructure in disaster areas.    Skydweller could also offer aerial support during search and rescue operations, for example during forest fires, with the flexibility of being able to take off from existing airports, be deployed thousands of miles away and remain in the air for months \u2013 without carbon emissions.  It is able to fly at night on battery power, using energy stored during the day.   Among the challenges that Skydweller will face is the fact that the plane will need sunshine to fly \u2013 which will limit its use at certain latitudes \u2013 and the regulations regarding unmanned aircraft. \u201cGovernments haven\u2019t gotten their minds around uncrewed vehicles yet, and carving out airspace for a long endurance mission would be a new challenge,\u201d says aviation analyst Gertler.   \u201cIt\u2019s a real race to see whether technology or regulation solves its issues first, but there\u2019s every reason to bet on technology,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt seems likely that they will arrive at the finish line before government has even begun to find the checkered flag.\u201d  ",

            "title": "Qantas reveals details of record-breaking Project Sunrise flights",
            "text": "Qantas has taken an important step toward launching Project Sunrise, its long-dreamed-of goal to establish direct flights between Australia and the cities of New York and London.    The airline has ordered 12 Airbus A350-1000s planes, with hopes that the ultra-long-haul routes can begin operating in 2025. In total, there will be 238 total seats on each plane, which is the lowest number for any Airbus A350s currently in service. Those seats are spread between four classes of service \u2013 first class, business class, premium economy and economy. Comfort will be a must, as these flights will clock in over the 19-hour mark, making them the world\u2019s longest non-stop flights.  Renderings for the plane interiors give some clues about what Qantas is planning for passengers on board. Images of the first class cabins show separate beds, reclining lounge chairs and even closets.  Meanwhile, the least expensive economy class seats will have a pitch of 33 inches, which compares with an average 30-31 inches on most carriers. \u201cWellbeing Zones\u201d will use communal areas of the plane to store healthy snacks and drinks as well as provide travelers a place to get up and stretch.    A dream years in the making  Australia\u2019s national flag carrier has made no secret of its goal to run direct flights between Melbourne and Sydney in Australia and New York City and London. Qantas has dubbed the scheme \u201cProject Sunrise.\u201d The name was inspired by clandestine World War II flights that were made from Perth to Sri Lanka en route to London. They were fraught with danger, and lasted so long they saw two sunrises. \u201cFor more than 100 years, Qantas has been at the forefront of transforming the way the world travels, particularly through direct flights,\u201d Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce said in a statement. \u201cNow, the A350 and Project Sunrise will make almost any city in the world just one flight away from Australia. It\u2019s the last frontier and the final fix for the tyranny of distance that has traditionally challenged travel to Australia.\u201d     In 2019, the airline ran a series of test flights on the Sydney to New York City and Sydney to London routes as an experiment.  The crew and passengers on board had their health monitored during the journey to see how such a long flight could affect future fliers. Tracking devices monitored sleep patterns, activity cycles, food and drink consumption and other data. Like many travel projects around the world, Sunrise was derailed by the coronavirus pandemic.  However, Joyce confirmed that the project was still a priority for Qantas. Last year, the CEO told CNN\u2019s Richard Quest that \u201conce we finish (upgrading Qantas\u2019 domestic fleet), which we\u2019ll do early in 2022, we\u2019ll revisit Sunrise and the likelihood is somewhere like 2024 or 2025 for the first aircraft arriving, given the delay.\u201d    What happens next  Although the first Project Sunrise flights are still years away, Qantas has already started thinking about expanding its ultra-long-haul offerings. The airline confirmed that Paris and Frankfurt are also being considered for future direct flights after the New York City and London routes are established.  In 2019, Qantas also included the city of Brisbane as one of the eastern Australia hubs for these flights, but it\u2019s unclear whether that remains part of the Project Sunrise plan. Meanwhile, a 17-hour nonstop flight connecting Melbourne and Dallas made its debut in March 2022.",

            "title": "Elon Musk sells $8.5 billion worth of Tesla shares",
            "text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk sold $8.5 billion of the electric automaker\u2019s stock in the three days after the Twitter board agreed to sell the company to him. Musk sold 3.7 million shares of Tesla stock on Tuesday, for a total of $3.3 billion, and another 735,000 shares on Wednesday, bringing in $654 million, according to filings he made with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday.  Friday morning he disclosed that he had sold an additional 5.2 million shares for a total of $4.5 billion. All told, he received an average price of $883.09 per share.  The sales represent only 5.6% of the Tesla shares he held outright at the start of the day Tuesday, and less than 4% of his total holdings of Tesla if stock options he controls are included.  The filings do not disclose the reason for the sale, but Musk appears to be raising funds to buy Twitter.  In a tweet Thursday evening, after the initial filings but before the disclosure of Thursday\u2019s sales, Musk said, \u201cNo further TSLA sales planned after today.\u201d  Company insiders, such as Musk, must report purchases or sales of their company\u2019s stock to the SEC to inform the broader investment community of their activity. But they have a couple of days to make that filing and still comply with the rules. Musk\u2019s sales of Tesla shares were large enough to sink the company\u2019s stock price. The 3.7 million shares sold on Tuesday represented 17% of the normal daily trading value in Tesla shares so far this year before Tuesday. Tesla shares lost 12.2% of their value during the course of trading Tuesday, the biggest one-day drop in the company\u2019s stock since September 2020. The stock\u2019s decline prompted a selling spree by other investors, as 45 million shares traded hands \u2013 about twice the volume of trades from the day before.  Tesla investors could also have sold shares this week out of concern that Musk would be unable to give as much time and attention to Tesla. The company has ambitious growth plans and growing competition. Shares of Tesla hardly changed Wednesday and Thursday. The stock was up 3% in early afternoon trading Friday, as his tweet apparently assured investors that his sales were complete. \u201cHow much he\u2019s going to have to sell now appears to be known. That\u2019s the reason for the bounce in the stock,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner of Loup Ventures. \u201cI actually thought he\u2019d have to sell more shares than this.\u201d But Tesla shares are still down nearly 18% since the day before Musk revealed he became Twitter\u2019s largest shareholder. The uncertainty of what the Twitter deal will mean for Tesla and Musk\u2019s commitment to the company has become an overhang on Tesla\u2019s stock, said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities. \u201cBesides the distraction issues, it brings the circus-like situation back into a Tesla story that has nothing to do with Tesla,\u201d said Ives. The uncertainty about the Twitter deal \u2013 shares are trading about 8% below the agreed-upon purchase price \u2013 only adds to the uncertainty for what Musk will do with his Tesla shares, Ives said. \u201cHe says it\u2019s the end and that makes me believe it likely is,\u201d Ives said. \u201cBut the Street will be watching closely to see if it truly is the end.\u201d Musk is expected to use his massive Tesla holdings as a way to finance his purchase of Twitter. But that doesn\u2019t mean he needs to sell all his shares to raise the full purchase price. Instead he can use the shares as collateral for loans to raise the cash.  But there are limits to how much money he can raise simply by pledging his Tesla shares as collateral. He can raise more money by selling some portion of his Tesla shares. Tesla corporate rules state that officers and directors of the company can raise only 25% of the value of the stock being pledged as collateral.  As of June 30, 2021, company filings show Musk already pledged 88.3 million of his Tesla shares as collateral, but those shares were pledged years ago when Tesla shares were worth a small fraction of their current value. He would likely be able to borrow more money even against some of those shares. Even if Musk doesn\u2019t use those shares as collateral, the estimated 67 million unpledged shares that he owns after this week\u2019s sales could be used to borrow nearly $17 billion \u2014 even with the recent decline in Tesla\u2019s share price.  But Munster said Musk probably doesn\u2019t want to go right up to that maximum, because if Tesla stock falls further he could be forced to sell some shares in the future. \u201cThis is a pretty volatile stock. It\u2019s up 10 times in value in just the past few years. Those stocks can go back down,\u201d he said.",

A very unique set of risks that Boeing probably shouldn\u2019t have taken,\u201d CEO David Calhoun said. \u201cBut we are where we are.\u201d    Boeing made the deal in 2018 after Trump publicly criticized the program\u2019s costs, writing \u201cCancel order!\u201d and amid Trump\u2019s tough rhetoric on China that risked consequences for Boeing and other US exporters.   Calhoun spoke on the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call and promised investors \u201ca very different philosophy\u201d to fixing in advance the price for military projects.    Boeing agreed to a fixed $3.9 billion price tag but has since encountered issues and higher costs that threaten to delay delivery of the two 747 jets until the end of 2026, approximately two years later than Boeing promised.    Earlier this month, the Air Force attributed the delay to a \u201ccombination of factors including impacts from the Covid-19 pandemic, interiors supplier transition, manpower limitations, wiring design timelines and test execution rates.\u201d Boeing declined at the time to comment on the delay.    Calhoun said the coronavirus pandemic complicated work because only a limited number of workers have the high-level security clearances necessary to work on the project.    \u201cWhen a Covid line goes down or a group of workers steps out, we don\u2019t have a whole bunch of cleared people to step into their shoes,\u201d he said.  \u201cFor VC-25B where the clearances are ultra-high, it\u2019s really tough,\u201d he continued, using the military model number to describe the jets.    The former President, with his deal-making persona, took an unusually hands-on approach to the Air Force One deal. He personally met with Boeing big-wigs at the White House to seal the deal. He also shared drawings for a new red, white and blue color scheme for the jets.    Other factors complicated the Trump-Boeing relationship. The company faced business pressure from his sharp criticism of China.  Following a pair of deadly crashes, the President personally announced the grounding of Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX jet \u2013 a matter typically handled by the Federal Aviation Administration. And his acting defense secretary, who ultimately withdrew from consideration for the permanent job after allegations of domestic violence surfaced, was a former Boeing executive.     ",

            "text": "The bad news keeps piling up for Boeing. The company is delaying the debut of its newest passenger jet to 2025, and it reported a much bigger-than-expected quarterly loss. The aircraft builder announced Wednesday it would temporarily pause the start of production for its 777X passenger jet, which it planned to start delivering to customers by the end of 2023. Demand for long-range and widebody passenger jets, a key to Boeing\u2019s commercial jet business, continues to be hurt by weak demand for international flights during the pandemic.  But Boeing attributed much of the delay to a longer certification process by the Federal Aviation Administration than in the past. Boeing said it didn\u2019t want to start production before the certification process was complete or near complete and then have to a large inventory of planes that required changes before it could deliver them. \u201cThey take a little longer than they used to,\u201d CEO Dave Calhoun said about regulators during a call with investors. \u201cThey\u2019re a little more thorough than they used to. Boeing is better for it in the long run.\u201d Demand for Boeing\u2019s freighter aircraft has remained strong, so it will go forward with the recently launched 777X freighter before it starts production of the 777X passenger jet. Boeing will continue to build both the earlier passenger and freighter versions of its 777 jet, known as the 777 Classic. Those models are due to be replaced by the 777X.  Pushing back plans for the 777X passenger jet will result in a total of $1.5 billion of abnormal costs for Boeing starting in the second quarter and continuing until production resumes. The company also booked $1.2 billion in special charges in the first quarter, including a $660 million charge related to higher supplier costs, higher costs to finalize technical requirements and schedule delays for completion of jets that will be used as the next Air Force One planes. It also includes $212 million in charges related to disruption of business caused by sanctions on Russia triggered by its invasion of Ukraine and a $367 million charge related to supply chain constraints, Covid-19 and inflationary pressures on its Red Hawk military jet. \u201cIt was a messier quarter than any of us would have liked,\u201d said CEO David Calhoun in an interview on CNBC. Even excluding those charges, the company posted a core operating loss of $1.5 billion in the first quarter, much worse than the $353 million operating loss Boeing posted in the first quarter of 2021. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had forecast a core operating loss of just $399 million in the quarter. The company also had an 8% drop in revenue to $14 billion compared to a year earlier. Analysts had been forecasting revenue to rise to $16 billion. Calhoun said the company remains confident in the 777X, despite the problems. He said the current certification process with the Federal Aviation Administration is one of the reasons to push back production of the plane. \u201cWe remain confident in the 777 program and our customers continue to see the value,\u201d he said in the note to Boeing staff. \u201cAirplane programs serve our market for several decades, and it is important we take the time now to position for long-term success.\u201d Boeing said it has taken an important step to restart deliveries of another widebody jet, the 787 Dreamliner, which have been halted since June of 2021 due to quality control concerns. Boeing disclosed Wednesday that it has submitted a certification plan to the FAA that would allow deliveries to resume, although it could not give an estimate as to when that will happen. \u201cEveryone would love for me to give you a date,\u201d Calhoun said in his CNBC interview. \u201cI can\u2019t do that because the FAA controls that process. We are confident and comfortable we\u2019ve submitted the best that Boeing can submit.\u201d As for the loss on the Air Force One planes, Calhoun said it was due to Boeing agreeing to provide the planes for a fixed price not knowing the delays that would be caused by Covid and by the rise in costs of materials and services provided by its partners. \u201cI\u2019m just going to call a very unique moment, a very unique negotiation, a very unique set of risks that Boeing probably shouldn\u2019t have taken,\u201d he told investors. \u201cBut we are where we are, and we\u2019re going to deliver great airplanes. And we\u2019re going to recognize the costs associated with it.\u201d Shares of Boeing\n            \n                (BA), a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, fell more than 7% in midday trading Wednesday.",

Morgan Stanley\n            \n                (MS) advised the Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) CEO on his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter\n            \n                (TWTR). The bank also helped secure $25.5 billion in funding for the deal, including $12.5 billion in loans that use Musk\u2019s Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) stock as collateral. That should lead to lucrative fees and interest income for Morgan Stanley\n            \n                (MS).  Investment banks usually get about a 1% to 3% cut of the value of a merger deal, which is split among all the banks involved. Based on the $44 billion purchase price, that works out to a range of $440 million to $1.3 billion.  So Morgan Stanley could be looking at taking in tens \u2014 or even hundreds \u2014 of millions of dollars from advising Musk, plus the Wall Street bragging rights. Morgan Stanley is one of the world\u2019s preeminent financial firms. According to so-called league tables tracked by the Financial Times, the bank raked in the second-largest amount of fees from investment banking in the first quarter. Its $852 million in fees so far this year trailed only Goldman Sachs, and was up 87% from the first quarter of 2021. Morgan Stanley said in its first-quarter earnings report that advisory revenue for mergers nearly doubled from a year ago. But overall investment banking revenue was held back by a slowdown in initial public offerings and corporate bond sales during a rocky first three months for the broader market. The bank had no comment about the company\u2019s work for Musk or Tesla.  But it shouldn\u2019t be a huge surprise that Musk is working with Morgan Stanley. After all, he has a more than decade\u2019s long relationship with the company. And the bank was one of four underwriters for Tesla\u2019s 2010 IPO, along with Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS), JPMorgan Chase\n            \n                (JPM) and Deutsche Bank\n            \n                (DB). Morgan Stanley\u2019s auto analyst, Adam Jonas, is one of the biggest Tesla bulls on Wall Street. Jonas currently has a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on Tesla stock and a $1,300 price target, 30% above the current stock price of roughly $1,000 a share. Jonas has also recently written positive reports about the prospects for two of Musk\u2019s multi-billion dollar privately held companies, SpaceX and The Boring Company. Jonas even suggested in 2017 that Tesla and SpaceX should merge, and more recently predicted that SpaceX could eventually help make Musk a trillionaire. So even if Musk\u2019s takeover of Twitter doesn\u2019t turn the company into a social media juggernaut that can challenge the likes of Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms\n            \n                (FB), Snapchat\n            \n                (SNAP) or TikTok, Morgan Stanley could still benefit.  Anything the investment bank does moving forward to stay in Musk\u2019s good graces could be beneficial, especially if the world\u2019s wealthiest person seeks advice on more mergers for Tesla, an IPO for SpaceX or The Boring Company or whatever other whim requiring him to raise more cash strikes his fancy.",

            "title": "Green jet fuel is here \u2013 so why are airlines not using it?",
            "text": "There is a small chance that your next flight will be powered, at least in part, by used cooking oils or agricultural waste.  These are among the ingredients of SAF \u2013 Sustainable Aviation Fuel \u2013 a new type of jet fuel that promises to curb carbon emissions by 80% on average, according to IATA, the International Air Transport Association.  The first commercial flights using SAF took off in 2011, and it has since grown to become a key element in making air transport more sustainable.  The aviation industry has pledged that, by 2050, its global carbon emissions will be half that of what they were in 2005. It then hopes to reach net zero, or the complete absence of emissions, as early as a decade after that. That\u2019s an extremely ambitious plan, and one in which SAF accounts for 50% to 75% of the total reduction in emissions, depending on the different scenarios that can play out between now and then.  And yet in 2019 \u2013 the last year of business as usual before the pandemic \u2013 SAF accounted for just 0.1% of all jet fuel used worldwide, according to the World Economic Forum. So why aren\u2019t airlines using more of it? Scaling up SAF is a \u201cdrop in\u201d fuel, which means it can be used now, in existing aircraft, with little or no modifications. \u201cThis is critical and very beneficial for the aviation industry, because there is no need to invest in new infrastructure or new aircraft, and it\u2019s great for airports too, because they can use the same storage and fueling infrastructure \u2013 from that perspective, SAF is excellent,\u201d says Andreas Schafer, a professor of energy and transport at University College London. In its bid to become more sustainable, aviation is also looking at next-generation technologies like hydrogen and electric-powered flight, but these require transformational changes that are still many years away. As Boeing\u2019s CEO David Calhoun put it, SAF is \u201cthe only answer between now and 2050.\u201d  SAF has a low carbon footprint because it\u2019s made from waste products, where the carbon has already been emitted, or from plants that use up CO2 to grow.  The problem is that it\u2019s currently much more expensive to produce than regular jet fuel, even with today\u2019s elevated oil prices. \u201cThere\u2019s no real business case for the sector to invest in it at the moment,\u201d explains Schafer, meaning that airlines have no incentive to use SAF other than to reduce emissions \u2013 but at current prices and amidst a global crisis brought on by Covid, that is a luxury they can\u2019t afford. To make the price go down, production needs to ramp up significantly and new types of SAF must come to the market.  Today, most SAF comes in the form of biofuel produced from waste fats such as used cooking oil, or from oil trees purposely grown on degraded land. However, there is not enough of these raw materials right now to supply the industry at a meaningful scale. Powered by trash In the near future, higher-cost biofuel could be produced from agricultural waste products, such as plant stems or husks, and residues from wood processing, as well as non-edible plants grown on purpose like miscanthus, similar to bamboo.  Even municipal waste, the household trash that often goes to landfill, has the potential to be turned into SAF.  Finally, further ahead, we will be able to make another type of SAF called \u201cpower to liquid.\u201d This method uses renewable energy to extract hydrogen from water and then mix it with CO2 taken directly from the air. The result is a synthetic liquid fuel that is carbon neutral and comes in a potentially endless supply \u2013 enough to satisfy the demand of the entire aviation industry. According to a cost analysis run by Schafer and his team, current SAF made from waste oils costs at least 50% more than regular jet fuel.  The second type, the higher-cost biofuel, can go for up to three times as much, and the \u201cpower to liquid\u201d one comes at nearly four times the price of jet fuel. And that\u2019s based on oil prices of $100 per barrel \u2013 the difference will only increase if oil prices go back to lower levels. How can we bring these costs down? \u201cWe need to expand the production of low-cost biofuels and then invest into the production of high-cost ones and power to liquid,\u201d says Schafer.  \u201cSeveral thousand production plants need to be built. And that\u2019s not all, because you need the renewable power generation infrastructure for power to liquid. And that\u2019s gigantic: half the electricity produced today globally would be required for the aviation sector in 2050. So the scale is enormous, and we better get started soon.\u201d  A challenging future The first commercial flight that used a blend of biofuels and regular jet fuel was operated by KLM in 2011, but test flights date back to 2008, with Virgin Atlantic and Air New Zealand among the earliest adopters.  Since then, many major airlines have used SAF in commercial flights, including SAS, Lufthansa, Qantas, Alaska and United, among others: according to IATA, over 370,000 flights with SAF in the fuel mix have taken off since 2016 alone. Aircraft and engine manufacturers are also conducting tests, signaling a global interest. In March 2022, for example, Airbus flew an A380 for three hours powering one of its Rolls-Royce engines entirely with SAF made from cooking oil and other waste fats.  However, progress has slowed down due to the pandemic, and the industry\u2019s pre-Covid goal of reaching 2% use of SAF by 2025 \u2013 from 0.1% in 2019 \u2013 now seems doubtful.  \u201cWe\u2019re certainly behind the 2025 goal and I think it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019ll get there naturally,\u201d says Glenn McDonald, an aviation analyst at Aerodynamic Advisory, suggesting that outside intervention is needed to make SAF more attractive, either via subsidies that make it cheaper or via a carbon tax that makes traditional jet fuel more expensive. It doesn\u2019t help that aviation is a global and fragmented industry with rules and regulations that vary from one country to the next. It\u2019s likely that progress will be uneven: Norway, for example, has mandated since 2020 that 0.5% of all jet fuel used domestically must be SAF, a share that must grow to 30% by 2030.  Preference shift According to McDonald, there are encouraging signs. \u201cAirlines are starting to take it more seriously because they see a shift in consumer preferences, especially among younger travelers, and they know they will have to meet these goals in order to be a viable industry in the 2050s,\u201d he says.  \u201cA common refrain we hear in the aerospace and aviation sector is that we don\u2019t want to become the new tobacco industry, where the business model isn\u2019t aligned with public policy and consumer attitudes.\u201d  For passengers, the shift to SAF might be entirely unnoticeable, because no visible aspect of a flight is affected by the change in fuel.  However, as airlines feel more pressure to use SAF before its cost aligns with regular jet fuel \u2013 no sooner than the 2030s according to the World Economic Forum \u2013 they might offload some of the costs on passengers, resulting in an increase in fares of up to 15%, according to Schafer. \u201cFrom a consumer perspective, that\u2019s not much, but from an airline perspective, it can be, because the profitability of airlines is typically well below 15%. So this will cause more restructuring in the market.\u201d",

            "text": "Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson seems to have joined the ranks of unruly airline passengers. \u201cUnfortunately, Mr. Tyson had an incident on a flight with an aggressive passenger who began harassing him and threw a water bottle at him while he was in his seat,\u201d Joann Mignano, a representative for Tyson, said in a statement.  Video obtained by TMZ Sports was taken on a JetBlue plane in San Francisco, according to TMZ. It shows a man repeatedly hitting what appears to be another passenger in the seat behind him.  The video published by TMZ does not show the entirety of the incident. A water bottle is not visible in the footage posted by the outlet. The video of the blows lasts about 10 seconds and features audio of a person who seems to be trying to defuse the situation, calling \u201chey Mike, Mike.\u201d  Melvin George Townsend III, the man Tyson appears to have hit, denies throwing a water bottle at Tyson, as the former boxer\u2019s representative previously alleged. Townsend\u2019s attorney Matt Morgan said his client is a \u201cbig Mike Tyson fan,\u201d in a statement obtained by CNN Friday afternoon. \u201cWhen Mr. Tyson boarded the plane he became overly excited. At first their interaction was cordial. At a certain point Mr. Tyson became agitated by an overly excited fan and began to strike him. This situation could have been avoided simply by contacting a flight attendant. Our client denies throwing a water bottle prior to being struck by Mr. Tyson,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cTo state the obvious, as one of the greatest fighters of all time, Mr. Tyson should have known not to use his hands on an overly excited fan,\u201d he added. On Wednesday evening around 10 p.m. PT,  police officers \u201cwere dispatched to a physical altercation onboard an airplane located at the Domestic Terminal of the San Francisco International Airport,\u201d according to the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD). Two people believed to be involved in the incident were detained, police said. One person was treated for non-life-threatening injuries, according to a statement from SFPD. \u201cThat subject provided minimal details of the incident and refused to cooperate further with the police investigation,\u201d the police said. Both people were released \u201cpending further investigation.\u201d SFPD declined to identify either subject. The police department said it was aware of video that may have captured the altercation, and it has shared the video with the San Mateo County Sheriff\u2019s Office. San Mateo County Sheriff\u2019s Detective Javier Acosta told CNN that office would handle the investigation moving forward and declined to name either subject, citing the ongoing investigation. JetBlue Airways has not responded to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Tyson was in San Francisco on Wednesday at the 420 Hippie Hill event in Golden Gate Park to promote his cannabis brand, according to the event\u2019s website and video posted online.   Cracking down on unruly passengers The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  said Thursday morning that it did not have a report at the time about an unruly passenger incident aboard a JetBlue flight on Wednesday.  \u201cThe FAA looks into all airline reports of passenger disturbances,\u201d the agency said in a statement to CNN. The FAA directed CNN to local law enforcement for further information. Unruly passenger behavior has spiked during the pandemic, with 2021 the worst year on record for reports of bad behavior on planes. A whopping 5,981 reports of unruly passengers were logged by the FAA in 2021. The agency introduced a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy on January 13, 2021, after a sharp rise in unruly passenger incidents in 2020. The FAA said that under the policy, it may issue fines to passengers for unruly behavior instead of warning letters or counseling. And cases can result in criminal investigations and charges.  The FAA said Wednesday that it will make its zero tolerance policy against unruly passengers permanent. That announcement came after the federal mask mandate for public transportation was struck down on Monday. The Justice Department has filed an appeal to that ruling. The incident aboard the JetBlue flight on Wednesday did not appear to involve masks, which are not currently required. However, mask-related incidents currently make up the majority of reports of unruly passenger behavior. In 2022, the FAA has already received 1,233 unruly passenger reports. ",

Dow component American Express\n            \n                (AXP) was off nearly 3% in response to its latest earnings. Stocks finished near their lows of the day. The Dow was down as much as 1,019 points heading into the close. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq each dropped more than 2.5%, too. All three indexes were in the red for the week, with the Nasdaq sliding almost 4% in the past five days. The Dow has now fallen for four straight weeks while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have declined for the past three weeks. Powell confirmed what many bond investors already suspected\u2026that a half-point interest rate hike is \u201con the table\u201d for the Fed\u2019s next meeting in May. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond has spiked to 2.9% in recent days\u2026the highest level since December 2018. Stock traders seem to be worried that even more aggressive rate hikes are in the cards beyond May.  Federal funds futures on the CME are indicating that the market is now pricing in a more than 90% chance of a three-quarter percentage point hike at the June meeting. That would bring rates, which were at zero just two months ago, to 1.5%. Rates haven\u2019t been raised that sharply since November 1994.  The Fed is hoping that the rate hikes will put an end to runaway inflation. Economists and investors are concerned that surging interest rates will slow the housing market and consumer spending, and usher in a recession. Some experts think that worries about the Fed going too far are overblown. \u201cMarkets are very uneasy about the growing likelihood of a policy error by the Federal Reserve,\u201d said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s madness really.  Most investors would be well served to ignore the machinations of the pricing craziness and wait to see what actually happens with rates.\u201d The CNN Business Fear & Greed Index, which measures seven indicators of market sentiment, fell into Fear mode Friday.  \u201cFed worries and disappointing earnings are a lethal combination given how tenuous market sentiment is at the moment,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.",

That\u2019s why investors shouldn\u2019t assume that Netflix\u2019s problems are bad for the rest of the tech sector or that Tesla\u2019s good news gives traders the all clear sign to buy every momentum stock in sight. \u201cFirst quarter results so far highlight our view that investors need to be selective,\u201d said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a report this week.  Haefele added that \u201cTesla\u2019s record profit underlines rising global demand for electric vehicles,\u201d and also pointed out that \u201cthe disappointing outcome for Netflix shouldn\u2019t obscure the robust outlook for subscription services.\u201d Netflix\u2019s big miss could wind up being a company specific issue. It\u2019s not necessarily a reason to shun all of the other FAANGs. Of course, investors are still willing to flock to companies that are reporting strong results. The success of Tesla shows that traders are not afraid of high-priced stocks that value investing gurus like Warren Buffett tend to avoid.  Yes, Tesla is expensive when you look at traditional price-to-earnings ratios and compare Tesla with the rest of the auto industry. But as long as Tesla lives up to the hype, that may not matter.  \u201cTesla\u2019s ability to achieve a trillion dollar valuation\u2026is a confirmation that paying up for future earnings potential is still a rational investment with the right business model,\u201d said Louis Navellier, founder of Navellier & Associates, in a report Thursday.

            "text": "Anheuser-Busch InBev said on Friday it would sell its stake in Russian joint-venture AB InBev Efes which will result in a $1.1 billion impairment charge in its first quarter results. The announcement by the world\u2019s largest brewer, based in Belgium, comes after similar moves from its rivals Carlsberg\n            \n                (CABGY) and Heineken\n            \n                (HEINY). In March, AB InBev suspended sales of its Budweiser brand in Russia and forfeited financial benefit from its Russian joint venture, following the lead of other major brewers in reaction to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow dubs a \u201cspecial operation.\u201d \u201cAB InBev today announced that it will sell its non-controlling interest in the AB InBev Efes joint venture and is in active discussions with its partner, Turkish brewer Anadolu Efes, to acquire this interest,\u201d AB InBev said in a statement.  AB InBev has a 24% stake in Anadolu Efes, part of its 2016 purchase of its next largest rival SABMiller. They formed the AB InBev Efes joint venture in 2018, combining their respective Russian and Ukrainian businesses. The joint venture has 11 breweries in Russia, employing 3,500 people and three in Ukraine, employing 1,800. Carlsberg is the leading Western player in Russia, followed by AB InBev. The Danish brewer said on Thursday its decision to sell its business in Russia would result in a writedown of about $1.39 billion. Dutch rival Heineken has said its Russia exit would amount to related charges of about 400 million euros ($434 million). AB InBev also said it had introduced Chernigivske, Ukraine\u2019s most popular beer brand, to many countries, including Britain, Germany, Belgium, France and the Netherlands. \u201cAll profits from the sale of Chernigivske will go to support humanitarian relief efforts and AB InBev is guaranteeing at least five million dollars of support from this humanitarian initiative,\u201d it said.",

            "title": "After two years of losses, airlines expect record revenue",
            "text": "After two years of massive losses, US airlines are about to start reporting profits once again. Both American and United reported first-quarter losses but expect to book record revenue in the current period, just two years removed from a near halt in air travel caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. American said its bookings and revenue in March were already the best month in the company\u2019s history. And both airlines expect to return to profitability in the second quarter, despite significantly higher fuel prices. Fuel is the second largest cost for airlines after employee compensation. In the first three months of the year, airlines were still weighed down by surging Covid cases and rising jet fuel prices brought on by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The first quarter is traditionally the weakest for airlines, but the most recent losses were far smaller than a year ago thanks to stronger than expected revenue. And revenues are about to get much, much stronger.  \u201cIn March, we saw what\u2019s possible,\u201d said Robert Isom, American\u2019s new CEO. \u201cWith surging demand brought on by reduced infection rates, relaxed restrictions and tremendous pent-up demand for people to travel, demand is as strong as we\u2019ve ever seen it.\u201d Sales are taking off again Late Wednesday, United reported a loss of $1.4 billion in the first quarter, about $1 billion less than the loss it reported in the same period a year ago after special items, such as federal financial support, are excluded.  On Thursday, American also reported a loss of $1.5 billion, about $1.2 billion less than a year ago. The airline said it was profitable in March, and that those profits should continue through the second quarter. Both American and United reported that first quarter revenue more than doubled compared to a year ago. American\u2019s revenue rose 122% to $8.9 billion, and United\u2019s was up 135% to  $7.6 billion.  The second quarter, which starts with the spring travel season and ends with summer travel in full force, is expected to be much better. The airlines\u2019 first-quarter revenue was still below the same period of 2019. But it was a very strong result given that there were still restrictions on international travel and business travel has not fully returned.  American estimates that corporate business travel was still only half of what it was before the pandemic, although it says bookings show that is rapidly improving as more companies reopen offices. Isom said overall business travel is forecast to reach 90% of pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter. Both airlines are flying at a lower capacity than they did before the pandemic because  international and business travel haven\u2019t bounced back fully. They\u2019re also operating with less staff, and it takes time to hire back qualified pilots and flight attendants. Fuller planes, higher airfares Unfortunately for customers, that means much fuller planes and higher fares.  The average per-mile airfare on United and American is about the same as it was in the first quarter of 2019. Since business and international travel is still lagging, having overall average fares close to 2019 levels means that domestic leisure travelers are paying more than they did, on average, before the pandemic.  One reason revenue is expected to be so strong in the second quarter is leisure travelers looking to book trips later in the year, before fares go any higher. \u201cAs we all well know after the last couple of years, a lot could change by the time the summer travel season arrives. But right now we\u2019re on track for a busy \u2014 and pricey \u2014 season ahead,\u201d Philip Baggaley, chief credit analyst for airlines at Standard & Poor\u2019s, said in a column for CNN Business. But the bad news for airline passengers is good news for airline investors. Shares of American rose 11% in premarket trading Thursday. United\n            \n                (UAL) shares were up 9%. And shares of rivals Delta\n            \n                (DAL), which reported results last week, and Southwest\n            \n                (LUV), which reports next week, were both up more than 3%.",

            "text": "The Ukrainian Air Force has added about 20 more operational aircraft to its fleet because of an influx of spare parts, according to a senior US defense official. Though the official wouldn\u2019t specify which country had provided the aircraft parts, the official said Wednesday that the US and other countries had worked \u201cto get them the parts they need to get them in the air.\u201d The flow of spare parts has allowed Ukraine to expand its fleet of operational military aircraft, despite Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion. The country has more aircraft now than it did three weeks ago, the official said. A day earlier, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Ukraine had received additional fighter aircraft to add to its numbers.  But on Wednesday, the senior defense official walked that back, saying Ukraine had not received more aircraft but had in fact received aircraft parts to make more of its existing aircraft functional.   Still, the official intimated that at least one country was considering sending Ukraine more aircraft. \u201cI was given to understand that an offer made by another country had actually been effected,\u201d the official said. \u201cThat offer has not been effected, so I was ahead of where things actually were.\u201d It is not known which country has made such an offer. The US has committed to sending Ukraine 16 Mi-17 helicopters, but the administration has declined to get involved in a transfer of MiG-29s from another country to Ukraine via the United States. Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky has repeatedly asked other countries for Soviet-era MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jets, which Ukrainian pilots already know how to fly. Zelensky has asked other Eastern European countries with the fourth-generation airframes to send them to Ukraine, but no country has yet agreed to do so. On Wednesday, the official Twitter account of Ukraine\u2019s Air Force said, \u201cUkraine did not receive new aircraft from partners! With the assistance of the US Government, @KpsZSU received spare parts and components for the restoration and repair of the fleet of aircraft in the Armed Forces, which will allow to put into service more equipment.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s Air Force has been part of its aerial defense network, which also includes S-300 surface-to-air missiles and portable anti-aircraft missiles. The combination of platforms has prevented Russia from establishing air superiority over Ukraine and controlling the skies.  Despite the constant bombardment from Russian missiles and artillery, as well as the strikes on military bases, Ukraine\u2019s Air Force has remained largely intact, though it has suffered some losses. In early March, about two weeks into the war, the defense official said Ukraine has 56 fighter aircraft, which composed about 80% of its fixed-wing fighters. But the Ukrainians weren\u2019t using their aircraft much, flying only five to 10 missions per day, the official said. Even now, with more operational aircraft, the Ukrainian Air Force is still flying a very limited number of daily sorties, another defense official said.",

            "title": "5 unusual airlines that really existed",
            "text": "In the late 1970s, the US government deregulated the airline industry, removing federal control over fares, routes and the entry of new airlines into the market.  As a result, a flurry of new airlines appeared from the 1980s onward, and some of them were particularly unusual. Let\u2019s take a look. Pet Airways Founded in 2009 in Delray Beach, Florida, Pet Airways was an airline exclusively dedicated to pets such as cats and dogs \u2013 or pawsengers, as they called them.  They flew, without their owners, in the main cabin of specially adapted aircraft in which the seats had been replaced with carriers.  Each aircraft could carry about 50 pets, with \u201cPet Attendants\u201d checking on them every 15 minutes. Before taking off, the animals were given a pre-flight walk and a bathroom break in specially designed airport lounges. The idea was that concerned pet owners would rather go to the length of flying their pets through a dedicated airline rather than having them on board their own flight in the cargo hold, a practice the Pet Airways website described as \u201cdangerous,\u201d citing extreme temperature variations and lack of proper lighting.  The airline operated for about two years, serving a dozen US cities including New York, LA, Denver, Chicago and Atlanta. Fares started at $150 and could go as high as $1,200 depending on the size of the animal. In 2012, the airline ran into financial trouble and started canceling flights, before ceasing operations completely the following year, after having ferried about 9,000 pets.  However, its website is still active, and a message states \u201cFlights to Commence, Post Covid, Hopefully Mid-2022,\u201d suggesting there might be a second life on the horizon for the pet airline. Hooters Air  In 2002, Robert Brooks, chairman of the restaurant chain Hooters, acquired Pace Airlines, a charter carrier with a fleet of eight aircraft, mostly Boeing 737s. The next year he turned it into Hooters Air, an airline designed after the restaurant chain.  Its distinction was, other than the bright orange livery design featuring a googly-eyed owl, that two so-called \u201cHooters girls\u201d were on board, mingling with passengers and hosting trivia games with gadget prizes \u2013 wearing the same tank-top-and-orange-shorts \u201cuniform\u201d popularized by the restaurants.  They did not serve food or handle on board duties, however, as these were carried out by three FAA certified flight attendants. The airline was based in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, a vacation hotspot known for its golf courses and seaside resorts, which had lost direct airline traffic in the general restructuring of commercial aviation following 9/11. Due to its budget pricing and direct connections to cities such as Atlanta, Newark and Baltimore, Hooters Air attracted passengers of all kinds \u2013 mostly golfers and tourists, but families as well. However, it was never successful enough to make money, and ceased operations in early 2006, due to the rise in fuel prices following hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  The Lord\u2019s Airline  Strictly no alcohol on board, Bibles and Torahs instead of in-flight magazines, only religious movies on show, and a quarter of the fares devoted to finance missionary work: these were the unique features of The Lord\u2019s Airline, founded by New Jersey businessman Ari Marshall in 1985, when he purchased an old DC-8 that was meant to be the airline\u2019s lone aircraft. The plan was to have three weekly flights from Miami to Ben Gurion Airport in Israel, offering a direct route to Jerusalem, about 30 miles away.  At the time, religious pilgrims looking to reach the Holy Land had to catch a connecting flight to New York. \u201cThe Russians have their airline. The British have one. So does Playboy. So why shouldn\u2019t the Lord have an airline all his own?\u201d Marshall said in 1986, according to The Associated Press. By 1987, however, the airline had failed to qualify for an FAA license because of unfinished modifications and maintenance works on the aircraft. Investors became nervous and removed Marshall, installing a new board of directors to move things along.  The new chairman, Theodore Lyszczasz, did not see eye to eye with Marshall and the two started bickering in the press.  Eventually, Lyszczasz and his brother showed up at Marshall\u2019s house demanding corporate records, which resulted, according to newspaper reports, in a scuffle and Marshall suing them for trespassing. They were acquitted, but the Lord\u2019s Airline eventually perished and the aircraft ended up being scrapped. Smokers Express & SmintAir The FAA banned smoking on all domestic flights in the US in 1990, but William Walts and George Richardson, two entrepreneurs from Florida\u2019s Brevard County, weren\u2019t happy about it. In early 1993 they decided to circumvent the rule by establishing an airline based on a private club. It required a $25 membership fee and was only open to people over 21. The airline was meant to be based at the Space Coast Regional airport in Titusville, Florida, and the plan was to offer steaks and burgers on board with a side of free cigarettes.  Almost a year after it was announced, however, the airline still had no license nor a plane, and although the founders reportedly claimed to have raked in over 5,000 memberships, regulators denied Smokers Express a license to operate, making it disappear in a puff of smoke without ever taking off. In 2006, the idea was revamped by German entrepreneur Alexander Schoppmann, who declared the intention to start Smoker\u2019s International Airways, or SmintAir for short. Schoppmann, who smoked 30 cigarettes a day, wanted to launch a daily service between Tokyo and Dusseldorf, his hometown, home to a large number of Japanese expats and the European offices of hundreds of Japanese companies.  Both countries still had significant numbers of smokers at the time. However, SmintAir suffered the same fate as Smokers Express: it failed to raise the capital required to start operations and never took to the air.  MGM Grand Air Inaugurated in 1987, MGM Grand Air was a first-class only, superluxury airline that initially covered a single route \u2013 LAX to JFK \u2013 using Boeing 727 and Douglas DC-8 aircraft in lavish configurations: the rule was to no flight could have more than 33 passengers, although the planes could carry 100 or more in standard setups. The airline promised no queues, no check-ins and no waiting for luggage \u2013 porters whisked bags onto the plane and returned them at the destination \u2013 and even offered an optional door-to-door limousine service. Special lounges at both airports offered luxury amenities and a concierge service.  On board, there were five flight attendants and a stand up bar, as well as private compartments for meetings. A full meal service with fine wine and champagne was always available and the restroom had golden faucets and monogrammed soap. All of this was offered at just more than the cost as a first class ticket on other airlines. Initially popular with celebrities and the very wealthy, MGM Grand Air eventually opened more routes, but was struggling to fill up all of the 33 seats on its planes. Operations slowed down in the 1990s, as private jets became more widespread, and in 1995 the airline was sold and changed its name to Champion Air, offering chartered flights to sports teams and government agencies. It eventually shut down completely in 2008. Top image: A Hooters plane arrives ft Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, April 3, 2003. Credit: Matthew Peyton/Getty Images",

            "text": "Tesla shareholders have been spending a lot of time following CEO Elon Musk\u2019s grand play to buy Twitter. Come Wednesday night they\u2019ll be focused once again on a company he already controls \u2014 Tesla itself. Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) reports first quarter results after the bell Wednesday. Analysts have a fairly bullish outlook for the companies\u2019 results.  Tesla earnings are expected to jump 142% from a year ago. Other traditional automakers, such as General Motors, Ford\n            \n                (F), Toyota\n            \n                (TM) and Volkswagen\n            \n                (VLKAF), are all expected to report a drop in earnings \u2014 ranging from a 14% decline at VW to a 58% plunge at Ford\n            \n                (F) \u2014 due to supply chain and production problems. But how the company does in the first quarter isn\u2019t the biggest concern for Tesla shareholders. It\u2019s what lies ahead for the company. Here\u2019s a rundown of what to look for in its earnings report and call with investors. Is Elon on the call? Nine months ago, Musk announced he would generally stop participating in the quarterly call, saying it took too much of his time. That lasted exactly one quarter.  By the time Tesla reported record fourth quarter results in January, he was back on the call, though his comments appeared to do more to worry investors than assure them.  Now with concerns among some investors that Musk\u2019s attention is being diverted by his bid for Twitter\n            \n                (TWTR), will he be on the call once again? There are risks for the company either way. \u201cFrom a perception standpoint, if he\u2019s not on the call, it feeds into the thesis that he\u2019s too busy with Twitter,\u201d said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities. At the same time, Musk can be a loose cannon on these calls.  During the early days of the pandemic in April 2020 he lashed out at stay-at-home orders in California that temporarily shut his main factory, calling them \u201cfascist.\u201d If he makes similar comments about far more stringent lockdown rules now in place in much of China, he could anger Chinese authorities, who could make life very difficult for Tesla in the world\u2019s largest market for electric vehicles.  Chinese lockdowns Speaking of which, investors will want to know what\u2019s the outlook for production in China in the face of those lockdown orders.  Tesla is reported to have reopened its plant in Shanghai this week, though the company has yet to confirm that. Investors will want to know if it can stay open, and what is going on with the factories of suppliers of critical parts, such as batteries. \u201cThe main focus of the earnings call must be around supply coming out of China,\u201d said Ives. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest overhang for the stock right now. They\u2019ve already lost about 50,000 cars of production so far in the second quarter. The question is are they going to give any guidance?\u201d Battery development Once upon a time, automakers lived and died by their internal combustion engines. Features such as fuel injection and measures such as horsepower were the keys to attracting buyers and getting top dollars.  Now in the age of EVs, it\u2019s batteries and a new set of performance measures: How far can a car go on a single charge? How fast can it charge? And how much will it cost to build? Tesla\u2019s next generation battery is the 4680, which is expected to provide a breakthrough in both costs and the distance a vehicle can travel on a single charge. Tesla has only recently started using the battery in vehicles, and it is still only available in limited volumes.  The outlook for production of that battery, and the supply of chips and raw materials it needs to build them, is crucial for Tesla\u2019s plans to increase vehicle production. New factories Within the last five weeks, Tesla has started shipping cars from two new factories: one outside of Berlin and one outside of Austin, Texas, where its headquarters is now based. How fast it can ramp up production, particularly with the supply chain problems caused by China\u2019s Covid lockdowns, and to a lesser extent the war in Ukraine, is crucially important if the company is to hit its growth targets for the year. Beyond that, investors will probably be looking for more on the new products set to be built in Austin, namely the Cybertruck pickup and Tesla\u2019s Semi truck. No significant production of either is expected before 2023 at the earliest, but it will be a bad sign if they are pushed back even further, especially with Ford and GM set to roll out their own electric trucks soon. The Ford 150 Lightning is due in showrooms this spring. The Silverado EV is due out next spring. Tesla\u2019s market cap is more than the combined value of the 12 largest automakers on the planet not because it is so much more profitable, but because of its growth projections. If it can\u2019t stick to its better than 50% annual growth path, the company\u2019s stock could take a tumble. What will it mean for Tesla if Musk buys Twitter? Finally, if Musk is on the call it will be particularly interesting to see if he makes any comments about his efforts to buy Twitter. So far his comments have been in broad strokes, not details. And he hasn\u2019t said anything about whether he plans to be involved in the day-to-day management of Twitter. \u201cThere are worries about Musk, at a time he should be so focused on Tesla, how can he juggle so many balls?\u201d said Ives.

            "text": "American banking giant JPMorgan Chase has unveiled plans for its new global headquarters: a 60-story skyscraper powered entirely by renewable energy. Set to complete in 2025, the 1,388-foot-tall tower will become New York\u2019s largest \u201call-electric\u201d building, according to Foster + Partners, the architects behind the design. A series of digital renderings, released last week, show the tower\u2019s stepped form soaring over Midtown Manhattan. In a joint press release, JPMorgan Chase and Foster + Partners said the skyscraper will achieve \u201cnet zero operational emissions\u201d \u2013 in part, by using power from a state hydroelectric plant.  Other energy-efficient design features include triple-glazed windows and systems for storing and reusing water that can reduce usage by 40%. The tower will also make use of \u201cintelligent building technology\u201d by employing sensors to monitor and reduce energy consumption. Construction work has already commenced at the site, which was once home to the 708-foot Union Carbide Building. The architects say that 97% of the building materials from the tower\u2019s predecessor will be \u201crecycled, reused or upcycled.\u201d The new design also promises more than double the amount of ground-level outdoor space at the address, complete with a public plaza and widened sidewalks. Foster + Partners\u2019 founder, the celebrated British architect Norman Foster, said in a statement that the tower was a \u201cnew landmark that responds to its historic location.\u201d \u201cThe unique design rises to the challenge of respecting the rhythm and distinctive streetscape of Park Avenue, while accommodating the vital transport infrastructure of the city below,\u201d he is quoted as saying. \u201cThe result is an elegant solution where the architecture is the structure, and the structure is the architecture, embracing a new vision that will serve JPMorgan Chase now and well into the future.\u201d The unveiling comes just months after former New York Mayor Bill de Blasio passed a law restricting the use of fossil fuels in all new residential and commercial buildings from next year. The legislation requires that all new buildings in the city are constructed to be fully electric by 2027. New York legislators are meanwhile considering new state-wide rules through the proposed All-Electric Buildings Act. The bill was introduced in 2021 by New York State senator Brian Kavanagh and assembly member Emily Gallagher, who say it will cut the state\u2019s carbon emissions by millions of tons while ensuring low-income residents can access affordable power. According to city officials, an estimated 70% of New York\u2019s greenhouse emissions come from buildings. Amid reports of an exodus from New York City during the pandemic, JPMorgan Chase also appears to be putting its weight behind in-person work: The new tower can house up to 14,000 employees across 2.5 million square feet of floor space \u2013 four times the capacity of the old Union Carbide Building.  The design offers occupants various \u201cwellness\u201d facilities, including air filtration systems, a health and fitness center, indoor greenery and \u201ctouchless\u201d technology. Located at 270 Park Avenue, the project forms part of wider plans to transform a 78-block stretch of New York\u2019s Midtown East. In 2017, city authorities voted to rezone the neighborhood, with De Blasio at the time promising \u201cmajor upgrades to subway stations, more expansive space for pedestrians, investments in its iconic landmarks, and a new generation of office buildings.\u201d",

Toyota\n            \n                (TM) said on Monday it\u2019s preparing to resume operations in Changchun, Jilin province \u2014 one of China\u2019s largest auto manufacturing hubs \u2014 following a month-long pause. \u201cWe have been gradually preparing to resume operations in our Changchun plant since late last week,\u201d the Japanese automaker said in a statement. \u201cHowever, the timing for full-scale operation has yet to be determined,\u201d it added. Toyota suspended production at its Changchun factory on March 14. Volkswagen\n            \n                (VLKAF) on Monday restarted production in its Changchun plants, which it also closed in mid-March.  But its Shanghai factory, which it runs in partnership with state-owned automaker SAIC, remains closed.  \u201cThe feasibility of SVW Anting plant [in Shanghai] resumption is under evaluation,\u201d Volkswagen said in a statement. Tesla was reportedly preparing to resume production at its Shanghai plant on Monday following a three-week stoppage, according to Reuters. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comments by CNN Business. China\u2019s worst Covid outbreak in two years has prompted authorities to ramp up the country\u2019s zero-Covid policy, locking down several major cities and tens of millions of people. The strict lockdowns in places such as Shanghai and Jilin have risked delaying shipments at a time when global demand for vehicles is strong.  The stringent Covid curbs have dealt a blow to economic activity. Government statistics showed Monday that consumption slumped in March, while unemployment rose, casting a shadow over the economic outlook. The Jilin government announced over the weekend that it would allow companies to resume work and production, after it declared victory eliminating community spread of the coronavirus outside quarantined areas.  Shanghai, the epicenter of the current Covid outbreak, has been under a lockdown for more than three weeks.  In an attempt to ease disruption, the Shanghai government on Friday published a \u201cwhite list\u201d of 666 companies that will be allowed to resume production. Nearly 40% are automakers, or companies involved in supplying the auto industry. But it\u2019s unclear exactly when those companies will be able to resume production. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Beijing bureau contributed to this report.",

            "text": "Nearly 400 million people across 45 cities in China are under full or partial lockdown as part of China\u2019s strict zero-Covid policy. Together they represent 40%, or $7.2 trillion, of annual gross domestic product for the world\u2019s second-largest economy, according to data from Nomura Holdings. Analysts are ringing warning bells, but say investors aren\u2019t properly assessing how serious the global economic fallout might be from these prolonged isolation orders.  \u201cGlobal markets may still underestimate the impact, because much attention remains focused on the Russian-Ukraine conflict and US Federal Reserve rate hikes,\u201d Lu Ting, Nomura\u2019s chief China economist and colleagues wrote in a note last week.  Most alarming is the indefinite lockdown in Shanghai, a city of 25 million and one of China\u2019s premiere manufacturing and export hubs. The quarantines there have led to food shortages, inability to access medical care, and even reported pet killings. They\u2019ve also left the largest port in the world understaffed.  The Port of Shanghai, which handled over 20% of Chinese freight traffic in 2021, is essentially at a standstill. Food supplies stuck in shipping containers without access to refrigeration are rotting.  Incoming cargo is now stuck at Shanghai marine terminals for an average of eight days before it\u2019s transported elsewhere, a 75% increase since the recent round of lockdowns began. Export storage time has fallen, but that\u2019s likely because there are no new containers being sent to the docks from warehouses, according to supply chain visibility platform project44.  Cargo airlines have canceled all flights in and out of the city, and more than 90% of trucks supporting import and export deliveries are currently out of action.  Shanghai produces 6% of China\u2019s exports, according to the government\u2019s statistical yearbook for 2021, and factory closures in and around the city are further rattling supply chains.  Sony and Apple supplier plants in and around Shanghai are idle. Quanta, the world\u2019s biggest contract notebook manufacturer and a MacBook maker, has stopped production entirely. The plant accounts for about 20% of Quanta\u2019s notebook production capacity, and the company previously estimated it would ship 72 million units this year. Tesla has shuttered its Shanghai Giga factory, which produced about 2,000 electric cars a day.  On Friday, China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said in a statement that it sent a taskforce to Shanghai to work on a plan to resume production at 666 key manufacturers in the locked down city. Tesla executives hope they\u2019ll be allowed to reopen their doors by Monday, ending the factory\u2019s longest pause since its 2019 opening. The automaker has lost over 50,000 units of production thus far, according to materials reviewed by Reuters.  \u201cThe impact on China is major and the knock on effects on the global economy are quite significant,\u201d said Michael Hirson, Eurasia Group\u2019s practice head for China and Northeast Asia. \u201cI think we\u2019re in for more volatility and economic and social disruption for at least the next six months.\u201d The prolonged disruptions to Chinese manufacturing and shipping could help accelerate a key Biden administration initiative aimed at reducing US dependence on Chinese products and supply chains.  But the task comes with serious immediate economic repercussions.  In a report released last week, the World Trade Organization warned of a worst-case scenario involving decoupling global economies, spurred on by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, could reduce long-term global GDP by 5%. That\u2019s highly unlikely given the deep financial connections between China and the US. Investment in each others\u2019 stocks and bonds reached $3.3 trillion at the end of 2020, according to data from Rhodium Group.  \u201cThese are still very intertwined economies,\u201d said Hirson. \u201cThat integration is not something that\u2019s going to be easily reversed because it would be incredibly costly for the US and for the global economy.\u201d  Still, American economic leaders believe decoupling is already underway. Oaktree co-founder Howard Marks wrote in late March that \u201cthe pendulum [has] swung back towards local sourcing\u201d and away from globalization. Blackrock Chairman Larry Fink echoed the sentiment in a letter to the company\u2019s shareholders. \u201cThe Russian invasion of Ukraine,\u201d he wrote, \u201chas put an end to globalization we have experienced over the last three decades. In a speech to the Atlantic Council last week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the US is watching China\u2019s political and economic connections to Russia closely. \u201cGoing forward, it will be increasingly difficult to separate economic issues from broader considerations of national interest, including national security,\u201d she said.  While she said she hopes a \u201cbipolar split\u201d between China and the US can be avoided, \u201cthe world\u2019s attitude towards China and its willingness to embrace further economic integration may well be affected by China\u2019s reaction to our call for resolute action on Russia.\u201d  A third of China, meanwhile, is stuck in quarantine, and its economy is suffering. China\u2019s recent pandemic response is likely to cost at least $46 billion in lost economic output per month, or 3.1% of GDP, according to research from the Chinese University of Hong Kong.  Analysts no longer believe that China\u2019s 2022 target of 5.5% economic growth, the country\u2019s least ambitious goal in three decades, is realistic. The World Bank revised its estimates for Chinese economic growth this week to 5% but noted that if its restrictive policies continue that could fall to 4%.  The economic burdens come at a politically precarious moment. This fall, Chinese President Xi Jinping will petition for a third term as the nation\u2019s leader, breaking with the tradition of a two-term maximum.  ",

            "text": "The images of the wrecked Antonov AN-225 are now an indelible memory for aviation enthusiasts worldwide.  Built in the 1980s to ferry the Soviet space shuttle, the plane got a second life after the Cold War as the world\u2019s largest cargo transporter, achieving records of all kinds, before being destroyed at the end of February at its home base, Hostomel airfield near Kyiv. \u201cThe dream will never die,\u201d tweeted the Antonov company, in reference to the plane\u2019s nickname \u201cMriya,\u201d meaning dream in Ukrainian. Solidarity poured in from every corner of the world.  But can the AN-225 ever fly again? Answering that question firstly requires an assessment of the damage sustained by the aircraft.  CNN\u2019s Vasco Cotovio has seen the wreckage up close, when he visited Hostomel airfield in early April, along with other CNN journalists and the Ukrainian National Police.  \u201cHostomel was the scene of intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces since very early in the war,\u201d he says.  \u201cMoscow\u2019s forces tried to seize the airfield to use it as a forward operating position to which they could fly in additional land units. To do that, they mounted an air assault with attack helicopters.  \u201cThey seemed to have had some initial success, but the Ukrainian response was very quick, hitting the airfield fast and strong \u2013 to prevent any sort of landing,\u201d he says. The condition of the plane left no doubts regarding the possibility of a repair.  \u201cThe nose of the plane was completely destroyed, seemingly the victim of a direct artillery hit,\u201d Cotovio says. \u201cIn addition to that, there was extensive damage to the wings and some of the engines. The tail end section was spared from any large impacts and has a few holes caused by either shrapnel or bullets.  \u201cHad it not been for the direct hit on the nose, the AN-225 might have been repairable,\u201d he says, adding that the area surrounding the plane was littered with spent ammunition, obliterated Russian tanks and trucks and destroyed armored vehicles.  A second coming Andrii Sovenko, a Kyiv-based engineer and aviation expert who has worked for the Antonov Company since 1987 and has flown on the AN-225 as part of its technical crew, has compiled a detailed list of the damage, by looking at a large number of videos and pictures of the wreckage (Antonov personnel are not yet allowed back at Hostomel due to safety concerns).  He confirms that the center section of the fuselage and the nose of the plane \u2013 including the cockpit and the crew rest compartments \u2013 are destroyed, but it\u2019s the plane\u2019s onboard systems and equipment that received the most critical damage. \u201cRestoring them will be the hardest,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is due to the fact that most of the various electrical systems, pumps and filters used on the AN-225 are all from the 1980s.  \u201cThey are simply no longer being made, so it\u2019s unlikely that they can be restored exactly in the way they were,\u201d he says. It\u2019s not all bad news: portions of the wings, including aerodynamic surfaces such as flaps and ailerons, appear to have suffered minor damage, and they could be salvageable.  Most of the six engines also seem intact, and the whole tail section of the plane is affected just by shrapnel damage, leaving it in acceptable condition. Sovenko, who wrote a book about the history of Antonov Airlines detailing his experience of flying on the Mriya, concurs that the plane at Hostomel can\u2019t be repaired. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to talk about the repair or restoration of this aircraft \u2013 we can only talk about the construction of another Mriya, using individual components that can be salvaged from the wreckage and combining them with those that were, back in the 1980s, intended for the construction of a second aircraft.\u201d He refers to the second AN-225 airframe that Antonov has preserved to this day in a large workshop in Kyiv. It was part of an original plan to build two AN-225s, which never panned out.  \u201cThis is a completely finished fuselage, with a new center section already installed on it, as well as the load-carrying structure of the wings and the tail unit. In other words, almost a complete airframe. As far as I know, it was practically undamaged during the Russian artillery bombardment of the plant,\u201d says Sovenko.  A new design There is one main problem with the idea of building out the unused airframe with salvageable parts from Hostomel: it still won\u2019t amount to 100% of the necessary components.  \u201cIt will be impossible to build exactly the same aircraft, with the exact same design and equipment,\u201d Sovenko says. If that is the case, Antonov faces two hurdles: making new and old components work together and potentially having to go through re-certification of the aircraft, to confirm its airworthiness and compliance with current regulations.  The company has experience with the first issue, having updated many of the AN-225\u2019s systems over the years and replacing the old Soviet tech with modern Ukrainian equivalents, but a full certification would require time and increase costs.  Unfortunately, that appears to be almost inevitable: \u201cIt\u2019s pointless to build an aircraft today with a 40-year-old design,\u201d Sovenko adds. \u201cIt\u2019s also quite possible that it will be considered appropriate to make additional changes to the aircraft design, based on the operating experience of the original.\u201d  The AN-225 was never designed to carry commercial cargo, and it was adapted for the job via extensive work performed by Antonov in the late 1990s. Nevertheless, despite its colossal capacity, the plane remained inconvenient to operate from the point of view of the crew. It has to be lowered on its nose \u2013 a maneuver known as the \u201celephant kneel\u201d \u2013 to load cargo, which is rolled onboard using custom tracks and pulleys.  Because of its unique design, only the nose of the plane opens, and it doesn\u2019t have a ramp at the back like its more practical smaller brother, the AN-124. The cargo floor could also use some reinforcement and the degree of compliance of the aircraft with existing airport infrastructure could be increased, adding to the list of desirable improvements in a hypothetical modern version of the aircraft.  Millions or billions? Building out a second Myria won\u2019t be cheap, but it\u2019s hard to establish exactly how much it would cost. Ukrinform, the Ukrainian national news agency, raised eyebrows when it declared that the cost of the operation would be $3 billion. In 2018, Antonov estimated that the completion of the second airframe would cost up to $350 million, although that figure might need to be revised up now.  \u201cNothing is known for certain at the moment,\u201d says Sovenko, \u201cThe cost will depend on how badly damaged the surviving parts of the aircraft are, as well as how many modifications and new equipment will be required. A large portion of the costs will depend on the amount of certification testing deemed necessary. But in any case, we can guess that the final amount will be in the order of hundreds of millions of dollars, not billions.\u201d Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at Aerodynamic Advisory, agrees: \u201cIt depends on whether the plane would be merely a prototype, or if they would want it to enter commercial service, with full certification. Certainly $500 million or so is more reasonable, even with certification, than $3 billion.\u201d  The real question, Aboulafia says, is who would pay for it? \u201cThere\u2019s really not much of a commercial application for this plane, and without that, where would the money come from?\u201d It\u2019s easy to think that most of the costs would be sustained by Antonov, but the company has suffered major losses through the destruction of several other aircraft and facilities; although it\u2019s still operating at a reduced level, its future is uncertain. \u201cI am an optimist. I sincerely and deeply wish that Antonov aircraft will continue to fly in the skies of the future,\u201d says Sovenko, \u201cbut I\u2019m also a realist. And I fully understand that the costs necessary to build the second Mriya will have to be correlated with the financial capabilities of Antonov after the war, as well as with the expected income from the operation of this aircraft.\u201d ",

            "text": "China has begun sending its most advanced fighter aircraft, the J-20, to patrol the East and South China Seas, Chinese state media has reported. Early versions of the J-20 stealth jet used Russian engines \u2013 but those have since been replaced with domestically-produced twin engines. The jets were first shown to the public with the new Chinese engines last year at Airshow China. The deployment is intended to \u201cbetter safeguard China\u2019s airspace security and maritime interests,\u201d state-run tabloid Global Times reported on Wednesday, citing military experts.  Ren Yukun, a spokesperson for the J-20\u2019s state-run manufacturer, added that it was a \u201ctraining routine\u201d for the J-20 to begin conducting patrols now that it\u2019s equipped with Chinese engines, according to Global Times. The announcement comes just weeks after United States Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, the commander of US Pacific Air Forces, said US F-35s and Chinese J-20s came into close proximity with each other over the East China Sea.  The East China Sea and South China Sea have both long been contested regions, with overlapping territorial claims by numerous countries. China claims almost all of the vast South China Sea as its sovereign territory. It has been building up and militarizing its facilities there, turning islands into military bases and airstrips, and allegedly creating a maritime militia that could number in the hundreds of boats. Meanwhile in the East China Sea, China claims sovereignty over the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, also known as the Diaoyu Islands. In recent years, the US has reiterated its promise to defend the Japanese islands in the event of foreign aggression. Experts say the deployment of the J-20s shows two things: China\u2019s increased confidence in its military abilities, and its warning to other countries with a stake in the territorial dispute. With some 200 J-20s reportedly in service, the People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) \u201cnow has in regular service a fleet of advanced stealth fighters as good as the Americans, who remain the benchmark,\u201d said Peter Layton, a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia. He added that China\u2019s message to the world is: \u201cAny foreign military aircraft intruding into China\u2019s claimed airspace in the East and South China Sea may now be intercepted by J-20s.\u201d While such a move would be politically fraught, the J-20\u2019s wide radius of action means it could patrol further out to sea, or stay longer in areas like the East China Sea, Layton said.  Small formations, such as a handful of jets, could also conduct occasional deep patrols into the South China Sea, land to refuel at one of China\u2019s island airbases, then return to the mainland. The PLAAF could even launch missions to overfly any US carrier battle groups that enter the South China Sea. The transition from Russian to Chinese engines also shows China\u2019s growing independence in military manufacturing, Layton said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that China does not need Russian help anymore, it is that Chinese-built aircraft are now superior to Russia.\u201d The fact that the J-20s now have more reliable twin engines than the Russian ones makes these patrols \u201ca much more plausible option,\u201d which could be why they hadn\u2019t been sent on patrol before, said Layton. The J-20 has long been touted as China\u2019s answer to the American F-22 \u2013 considered the world\u2019s premier stealth fighter jet \u2013 and the F-35. A 2017 report by the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the new Chinese engines would give the J-20 low supercruise ability, meaning they could fly at supersonic speeds for prolonged periods. US officials have long said the J-20 can\u2019t stack up to US stealth fighters \u2013 but Wilsbach, the US Pacific Air Forces commander, said last month that the J-20s made a strong impression when they encountered US F-35s over the East China Sea. \u201cWe\u2019re relatively impressed with the command and control that was associated with the J-20s,\u201d Wilsbach said at a Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies conference. The US observed \u201crelatively professional flying\u201d by the Chinese aviators, he said, but noted the US was unsure how China would employ the J-20s, whether in multi-mission roles like the F-35 or in an air superiority role like the F-22. Layton said the US, Japan and other countries will be \u201ckeenly collecting electronic intelligence data\u201d on any J-20s out on coastal patrols, hoping to gather more information on its stealth characteristics, as well as any radio and datalink transmissions.",

            "text": "Wall Street\u2019s biggest players have had a rough start to the year.  All of the biggest US banks saw profits take a hit in the first three months of 2022, ending a pandemic-era boom.  Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo all announced large year-over-year profit declines in their first-quarter earnings reports Thursday, joining JPMorgan Chase, which announced Wednesday that its first-quarter profit fell 42%.  Citi saw a drop of 46%, Goldman Sachs fell 42%, Morgan Stanley dropped 11% and Wells Fargo fell 21%. Since 2020, banks have benefited from the longest bull run in history, record-high trade volumes, surging bank deal values, low interest rates and big reserve releases driving profit spikes.  Now executives are warning that the good times are coming to an end.  \u201cIt was a turbulent quarter dominated by the devastating invasion of Ukraine,\u201d Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in his company\u2019s release Thursday. \u201cThe rapidly evolving market environment had a significant effect on client activity as risk intermediation came to the fore and equity issuance came to a near standstill.\u201d Goldman earned $3.94 billion in the quarter, down from $6.84 billion a year ago. Still, earnings per share came in at $10.76,  analysts had expected $8.89 per share, according to Refinitiv data.   The bank, Solomon said, did well by expanding its role in consumer banking, wealth and asset management where Goldman\u2019s net revenue jumped 21% to $2.1 billion, aided largely by increased management fees and credit card balances. Citi also prepared for big losses caused by geopolitical strife. The bank added $1.9 billion to its reserves in order to prepare for losses from Russia and the Ukraine war. The bank beat estimates, bringing in $2.02 per share, compared with forecasts for $1.43 per share.  Morgan Stanley beat earnings estimates and saw strong revenue from equity and fixed income. The bank outperformed Goldman Sachs in merger and acquisition advisories, but business was still down overall. Equity underwriting deal volumes fell 80% in the quarter for both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, according to Refinitiv data.  Wells Fargo, meanwhile, also warned of economic headwinds on the horizon.  \u201cOur internal indicators continue to point towards the strength of our customers\u2019 financial position, but the Federal Reserve has made it clear that it will take actions necessary to reduce inflation and this will certainly reduce economic growth,\u201d Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said. \u201cIn addition, the war in Ukraine adds additional risk to the downside.\u201d Mortgage loans at Wells Fargo fell 33% from a year ago as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. The company beat earnings per share estimates, bringing in 88 cents per share, higher than the 80-cent estimate from Refinitiv, but didn\u2019t live up to revenue estimates. The bank came in with $17.6 billion, short of the Refinitiv consensus of $17.8 billion. ",

            "text": "Alleghany Corp, which agreed last month to be acquired by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, was sued on Wednesday by a shareholder who accused the insurance company of making inadequate and misleading disclosures about the $11.6 billion takeover. In a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the plaintiff Shiva Stein said Alleghany failed in a proxy statement to adequately explain the financial basis for the \u201cfairness opinion\u201d issued by its bankers at Goldman Sachs, which assessed whether the deal was fair to shareholders. Absent additional disclosures, \u201cplaintiff will be unable to make a fully-informed decision regarding whether to vote in favor of the proposed transaction, and she is thus threatened with irreparable harm,\u201d the complaint said. Stein wants to block Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKB) from buying New York-based Alleghany unless more disclosures are made, and also seeks unspecified damages. The New Jersey resident has not argued that the takeover price is too low. Alleghany did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for the plaintiff did not immediately respond to a similar request. Berkshire is not a defendant. Shareholders like Stein often sue to block corporate mergers when they find the terms unfair or the disclosures too sparse. On April 1, Stein sued Mandiant Inc to block the cybersecurity company\u2019s $5.4 billion takeover by Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, also citing an alleged lack of disclosures to support a Goldman fairness opinion. Berkshire agreed on March 21 to pay $848.02 per share for Alleghany, a 25% premium. Goldman\u2019s fairness opinion called that price \u201cfair from a financial point of view\u201d to Alleghany shareholders. The purchase would expand Berkshire\u2019s large portfolio of insurers, including Geico and General Re. It would also reunite Buffett with Alleghany Chief Executive Joseph Brandon, who led General Re from 2001 to 2008.

            "text": "What caught your eye the last time you looked out of your airplane window? It might have been the winglet, a now ubiquitous appendage at the end of each wing, often used by airlines to display their logo and put their branding in your travel pictures. But the winglet isn\u2019t there for marketing purposes alone \u2013 it actually saves fuel. On average, an aircraft equipped with them can use up to 5% less fuel, and for a typical Boeing 737 commuter plane that can mean 100,000 gallons of fuel a year, according to NASA. The collective savings for airlines are in the billions of dollars. They do so by reducing the natural vortices that form at the wingtips, which can be so strong that smaller aircraft can even flip in mid-air when crossing the wake of very large planes. The effect is so obvious that aerodynamicists were thinking about it even before the Wright brothers completed their first flight. The widespread adoption of winglets, however, is far more recent. A better design As air flows around a plane\u2019s wings, it generates high pressure on the bottom surface and low pressure on the top one, which creates lift. But once the air flowing at the bottom reaches the wingtip, it tends to curl upwards and meet the lower pressure air at the top, generating what is essentially a small tornado. This extends behind the aircraft producing drag, which equals a loss of energy. \u201cThat energy that\u2019s being left in the air is coming from the aircraft,\u201d says Al Bowers, a former chief scientist at NASA\u2019s Neil Armstrong Flight Research Center. \u201cIf there were a way to capture more of that energy and keep it on the aircraft, that would result in less energy being wasted in its wake.\u201d In 1897, British aerodynamicist Frederick W. Lancaster patented \u201cwing endplates,\u201d vertical surfaces to be placed at the end of wings to stop the airflow from the bottom and the top from meeting, reducing drag. \u201cEndplates in many ways act much like winglets do, but the improvement to the lift is rather poor, because flat plates by themselves are not very good aerodynamic surfaces,\u201d explains Bowers. The idea was refined for modern aircraft  in the 1970s by NASA engineer Richard Whitcomb, who imagined vertical wing extensions inspired by the way birds curl up the end of their wings when in need of lift. \u201cIt was Whitcomb who developed the idea that these should be much more aerodynamic surfaces, actually wing-shaped themselves,\u201d says Bowers. \u201cHe realized that setting the angle correctly on them would result in a dramatic drag reduction.\u201d The name winglet, meaning little wing, naturally followed. Whitcomb tested the idea in a wind tunnel and found that winglets could achieve a reduction of drag of about 5%. At the same time, winglet research was happening independently of NASA, and business jet manufacturer LearJet was the first to mount winglets on an actual aircraft, in 1977. Two years later, NASA first flew an Air Force KC-135 test plane \u2013 not too different from a Boeing 707 airliner \u2013 equipped with nine-foot-high winglets. Over 47 test flights, NASA confirmed Whitcomb\u2019s wind tunnel findings. Blended winglets Despite the encouraging results, winglets didn\u2019t immediately attract interest from airlines, because they still added extra weight to the plane and were expensive to install.  \u201cIn the early days, even after Whitcomb, the engineering tools used to design them weren\u2019t all that good and the mantra was \u2018winglets help at low speed but they hurt at high speed,\u2019\u201d says Mark D. Maughmer, an expert in winglet design and a professor of aerospace engineering at Penn State.  \u201cSo they didn\u2019t find their way onto commercial transports at that time because airlines didn\u2019t want the penalty of the winglet.\u201d Things changed when a company called Aviation Partners designed the \u201cblended\u201d winglet. Founded in 1991, it hired former Boeing aerodynamicist Louis Gratzer, who in 1994 received a patent for a new type of winglet design that flows smoothly out of the wingtip, offering a significant increase in efficiency compared to the previous, more angular versions. The first plane to use the blended winglet was the Gulfstream II, a twin-engine business jet with a maximum capacity of 19 passengers. Soon after, Aviation Partners looked to expand into bigger aircraft and started working with Boeing, which had demonstrated interest in winglets by putting them on the 747 for the first time in 1988. \u201cThe entry point with Boeing was the Boeing Business Jet, which is basically a 737,\u201d says Mike Stowell, CEO of Aviation Partners Boeing, a joint venture between Boeing and Aviation Partners. It was formed in 1999 and designs winglets that Boeing installs directly at the factory on new planes, and also retrofits existing Boeing aircraft with blended winglets (a 737 retrofit typically costs $750,000). According to Stowell, some of the appeal of blended winglets is based on their sleek appearance, not just the fuel savings.  \u201cI think some of the [early business customers] wanted a different look \u2013 they didn\u2019t want their plane to look like a commercial aircraft,\u201d he says. \u201cSo for the private guys it\u2019s probably a blend of range and looks, keeping up with the guys next door. For the commercial guys, probably not.  \u201cWe asked one major airline about a specific shape we were looking at, and the quote from the CEO of the airline was \u2018You can put a piano out on the end of the wing \u2013 if it saves fuel, we don\u2019t care.\u2019\u201d Aviation Partners says it has fitted 10,000 aircraft with their winglets \u2013 in the 737, 757 and 767 families, as well as business jets \u2013 which they estimate has saved a total of 13 billion gallons of fuel.  They have since created updated designs, including the \u201csplit scimitar,\u201d designed for the 737, and the \u201cspiroid\u201d winglet, used on some business jets, which includes a loop. The designs are all meant to further improve efficiency and decrease fuel burn. Raked wingtips Unlike Boeing, Airbus was a late adopter of winglets and remained unconvinced of their benefits well into the 2000s. In 2011 it first flew their own winglet design, calling it a \u201csharklet.\u201d \u201cAirbus was late to the game, but they caught up fast,\u201d says Maughmer.  The A320 family \u2013 currently the world\u2019s best-selling airliner with over 16,000 orders \u2013 started having sharklets as an option in 2012, while existing A320s have been retrofitted since 2015. Airbus promised a 4% decrease in fuel burn and a saving of 900 tonnes of CO2 per aircraft per year. In 2013, with the A350, Airbus further refined its winglet design, which was no longer a separate appendage but rather a \u201csmooth three-dimensional twisting of the basic wing shape.\u201d The new design was also applied to the A320neo, a newer version of the popular plane with better engines, which now comes with sharklets as standard. Winglets are now found on almost every small and mid-sized jet in the world, although their efficacy on bigger aircraft is less obvious.  \u201cThey help the climb, but they hurt the cruise,\u201d summarizes Maughmer, explaining why planes that perform mostly long haul flights, therefore spending most of their time in cruise, might benefit less from winglets. As a result, models such as the Boeing 787 and 777 don\u2019t have winglets, but rather raked wingtips, or wingtips that have more backward sweep compared to the rest of the wing \u2013 a design that is more efficient during cruise to suppress wingtip vortices. The fuel savings are comparable to winglets. If you\u2019re a frequent flier, you might also like to know that winglets can make turbulence a bit more bearable, according to Bowers: \u201cThey improve the directional stability of the aircraft,\u201d he says. \u201cI once flew on two different 737s on a trip one time, and one had winglets while the other one did not. The difference was quite dramatic: the one without winglets rode a little harder in turbulence. It was like riding in a sports car on a bumpy road, compared to a luxury sedan.\u201d",

            "text": "Travel is booming, and Delta Air Lines boosted ticket prices. That helped the company weather higher fuel costs in the first quarter, and Delta believes it can turn a profit in the second quarter. The company reported an adjusted net loss of $784 million in the first quarter, which was about $50 million less than Wall Street analysts had expected. Its revenue of $9.3 billion came in about $400 million higher than forecasts. The company said it was profitable in March. Demand for travel is so strong right now that CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC that March was Delta\u2019s best month ever for bookings \u2014 both for flights in March itself and for upcoming travel. \u201cDemand is phenomenal,\u201d he said on CNBC. \u201cThis is continuing in April. Consumers are ready to go.\u201d \u201cThere are clear signs of pent-up demand for travel and experiences as consumers\u2019 spending shifts from goods to services and experiences, travel restrictions lift and business travelers continue to return to the skies,\u201d he told investors on a conference call later Wednesday morning. Bastian said that demand for travel at the beginning of the quarter was negatively affected by the surge of Covid cases from the Omicron variant,  but that demand rebounded quickly as that surge started to subside in mid-February. He added that there has been no sign so far of a negative impact on travel caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. That strong demand has translated into fuller planes and higher fares. Unit revenue, a measure of airfares, should be up more than 10% in the second quarter compared to same period of 2019, Delta anticipates. Its unit revenue in March was above that of March 2019, the first month since the start of the pandemic that the airline has achieved a positive comparison. \u201cWe are successfully recapturing a significant portion of the run-up in fuel,\u201d Bastian told investors. The first quarter is typically the slowest for US airline profits and revenue. But the second quarter, which includes the spring travel season and the start of summer travel, should be stronger.   A growing number of workers are returning to the office after two years of remote work, and business travel is expected to pick up. So is international travel. Those passengers typically pay higher fares than leisure travelers on domestic flights. Domestic business travel was still only about 50% of pre-pandemic levels throughout the first quarter, but by March that had risen to 70%. And a survey of corporate customers found that 90% expect travel to increase in the second quarter said Delta President Glen Hauenstein. Delta said it expects sales in the second quarter to be between 3% and 7% lower than in the same period of 2019, before the pandemic severely disrupted air travel. Yet Delta is flying just 84% of the capacity it flew back then. Part of the reason is the continued restrictions on international travel \u2014 but even domestic capacity is still only back to 90% of where it was before the pandemic.  Delta is doing what it can to increase capacity, Bastian said, including hiring the additional employees it needs to restore more flights to its schedule. But the 15,000 new employees the company has hired since the start of 2021 is still not enough to make up for the loss of staff during the pandemic, when Delta offered early retirement and buyout packages to reduce headcount. \u201cMaybe by end of year, if we really pushed it, we could get back to 100% [of pre-pandemic capacity],\u201d he told CNBC. But he said that\u2019s not the current desire of management. \u201cCandidly, right now, for the amount of demand we have, we\u2019re sitting on a pretty good spot [on capacity],\u201d he said. Hauenstein added that the airline is not seeing any drop in demand as fares move higher. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a lot of resistance to the price points that we have in market,\u201d he said.  But with a greater percentage of available seats already booked for the summer travel season than three years ago, price-sensitive customers need to book early and be flexible with their travel dates. Bastian said that Delta believes that Covid is shifting from a pandemic to a manageable seasonal virus, which is helping demand for travel. And he added that it\u2019s time for the federal mask mandate on travel to end. Most US airline CEOs also have urged the mandate be allowed to expire.  CNN has learned that the Centers for Disease Control now plans extend the mask mandate, which was due to end Monday, for another 15 days. Bastian also disclosed that as of this month Delta is dropping a $200 monthly surcharge on what its employees pay for health insurance if they are not vaccinated. Unlike some other airlines, such as United, Delta never required its employees to get vaccinated. \u201cWe really do believe that the pandemic has moved to a seasonal virus,\u201d he said about the reason for dropping the surcharge.  There is not yet a clear scientific consensus on the seasonality of Covid-19. But while hospitalizations from Covid are down, they are still more likely for those who are not vaccinated. At the time Delta announced a surcharge for its  unvaccinated workers, Bastian said employees hospitalized with the disease cost the company an average of $50,000 each. Still, Delta and the rest of the airline industry face surging fuel prices.  Delta said it expects to pay an average of $3.20 to $3.35 a gallon for jet fuel in the second quarter, up from $2.79 a gallon in the first quarter and only $2.06 a gallon in the first quarter of 2019.  But the company has a major advantage that most of its competitors don\u2019t: it owns its own oil refinery. Higher fuel prices meant the refinery brought in $1.2 billion in revenue in the quarter, up sharply from only $48 million in the first quarter of 2019. Shares of Delta\n            \n                (DAL) jumped 4% in midday trading on the news and guidance.",

The aircraft maker said it is not canceling the orders \u2014 yet. But it has placed them in an accounting limbo which it uses when there are questions about whether jet orders on its books are likely to be completed. The company disclosed Tuesday that it added 141 jets to that accounting classification in March. About two-thirds of those orders \u2014 or just more than 90 \u2014 are for 737 Max jets that have been affected by the war in Ukraine and related economic sanctions. The company has seen an increase of orders added to this accounting limbo in the last two years, as the pandemic caused a sharp drop in demand for new planes. Including the additions in March, there are now nearly 950 commercial jet orders deemed to have that uncertain status, leaving Boeing with a backlog of about 4,300 jets yet to build. Sanctions are preventing any current aircraft sales to Russia. Boeing and other western aircraft makers such as Airbus have also cut off the supply of needed spare parts and maintenance support for planes in Russia in order to comply with sanctions. So doubts about future orders to Russia are no surprise. Boeing\u2019s data show only 30 737 Max jets orders from a Russian carrier, Utair Airlines. But most Russian airlines order jets from Boeing and rival Airbus through leasing companies. So there were likely more Boeing jets destined for Russia before the war.  Even if sanctions are lifted, the relationship between Russia and the leasing companies has probably been permanently damaged by Russia\u2019s move to nationalize and take title of hundreds of planes owned by those companies. Boeing also reported another seven 737 Max jets on order by Ukraine airline, SkyUp. The good news for Boeing\n            \n                (BA) is that it had a net increase of 38 new orders during the month of March.",

Last month, President Vladimir Putin authorized the seizure of US and European-leased commercial aircraft, allowing them to be reregistered and issued with local certificates of airworthiness to keep Russia\u2019s domestic services running and make it harder for the jets to be reclaimed. In doing so, the EU said Russia was deliberately allowing foreign-owned aircraft to continue to fly without meeting safety standards. \u201cThe Russian Federal Air Transport Agency has allowed Russian airlines to operate hundreds of foreign-owned aircraft without a valid certificate of airworthiness,\u201d the European Commission said in a statement.

            "title": "SpaceX just launched paying customers to the ISS. Here\u2019s everything you need to know",
            "text": "A SpaceX rocket carrying three paying customers and a former NASA astronaut took off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Friday morning, kicking off a first-of-its-kind mission that will take the group on a 10-day mission to the International Space Station. The spacecraft, which separated from the rocket after reaching orbit, is now free flying through orbit and will spend all day Friday slowly maneuvering closer to the ISS, where it\u2019s slated to dock Saturday around 7:45 am ET. The trip was brokered by the Houston, Texas-based startup Axiom Space, which seeks to book rocket rides, provide all the necessary training, and coordinate flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it. It\u2019s all in line with the US government\u2019s and the private sector\u2019s goal to boost commercial activity on the ISS and beyond. On board this mission, called AX-1, are Michael Lopez-Alegr\u00eda, a former NASA astronaut turned Axiom employee who is commanding the mission; Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe; Canadian investor Mark Pathy; and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor. It\u2019s not the first time paying customers or otherwise non-astronauts have visited the ISS, as Russia has sold seats on its Soyuz spacecraft for various wealthy thrill seekers in years past. But this is the first mission that includes a crew entirely comprised of private citizens with no active members of a government astronaut corps. It\u2019s also the first time private citizens have traveled to the ISS on a US-made spacecraft.   Here\u2019s everything you need to know. How much did this all cost? Axiom previously disclosed a price of $55 million per seat for a 10-day trip to the ISS, but the company declined to comment on the financial terms for this specific mission \u2014 beyond saying in a press conference last year that the price is in the \u201ctens of millions.\u201d The mission is made possible by very close coordination among Axiom, SpaceX and NASA, since the ISS is government-funded and operated.  And the space agency has revealed some details on how much it\u2019ll charge for use of its 20-year-old orbiting laboratory. Food alone costs $2,000 per day, per person, in space. Getting provisions to and from the space station for a commercial crew is another $88,000 to $164,000 per person, per day. For each mission, bringing on the necessary support from NASA astronauts will cost commercial customers another $5.2 million, and all the mission support and planning that NASA lends is another $4.8 million. Who is flying? Lopez-Alegr\u00eda, a veteran of four trips to space between 1995 and 2007 during his time with NASA, is commanding this mission as an Axiom employee. For more about the three paying customers he\u2019s flying alongside, check out our coverage here. Is it safe to go to the ISS, given the Russia conflict? Russia is the United States\u2019 primary partner on the ISS, and the space station has long been hailed as a symbol of post-Cold War cooperation. US-Russian relations on the ground, however, have hit a fever pitch amid Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The United States and its allies have slapped hefty sanctions on Russia, and the country has retaliated in numerous ways, including by refusing to sell Russian rocket engines to US companies. The head of Russia\u2019s space agency, Roscosmos, has even taken to social media to threaten to pull out of the ISS agreement. Despite all the bluster, NASA has repeatedly sought to reassure that, behind the scenes, NASA and its Russian counterparts are working together seamlessly.  \u201cNASA is aware of recent comments regarding the International Space Station. US sanctions and export control measures continue to allow US-Russia civil space cooperation on the space station,\u201d NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a recent statement. \u201cThe professional relationship between our international partners, astronauts and cosmonauts continues for the safety and mission of all on board the ISS.\u201d Are they astronauts or tourists? This is a question stewing in the spaceflight community right now.  The US government has traditionally awarded astronaut wings to anyone who travels more than 50 miles above the Earth\u2019s surface. But commercial astronaut wings \u2014 a relatively new designation handed out by the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 might not be handed out quite so liberally. Last year, the FAA decided to end the entire Commercial Space Astronaut Wings program on January 1, 2022. Now, the FAA plans to simply list the names of everyone who flies above the 50-mile threshold on a website. Whether it\u2019s fair to still refer to people who pay their way to space as \u201castronauts\u201d is an open question, and countless observers \u2014 including NASA astronauts \u2014 have weighed in.  Not everyone is too concerned about mincing words. \u201cIf you\u2019re strapping your butt to a rocket, I think that\u2019s worth something,\u201d former NASA astronaut Terry Virts told National Geographic when asked about the issue. \u201cWhen I was an F-16 pilot, I didn\u2019t feel jealous about Cessna pilots being called pilots. I think everybody\u2019s going to know if you paid to be a passenger on a five-minute suborbital flight or if you\u2019re the commander of an interplanetary space vehicle. Those are two different things.\u201d If you ask the AX-1 crew, they don\u2019t love being referred to as \u201ctourists.\u201d  \u201cThis mission is very different from what you may have heard of in some of the recent \u2014 especially suborbital \u2014 missions. We are not space tourists,\u201d Lopez-Alegr\u00eda told reporters earlier this month, referring to the brief supersonic flights put on by Jeff Bezos\u2019 company Blue Origin. \u201cI think there\u2019s an important role for space tourism, but it is not what Axiom is about.\u201d The crew did undergo extensive training for this mission, taking on much of the same tasks as professional astronauts-in-training. But the fact is that the three paying customers on this flight \u2014 Stibbe, Pathy, and Connor \u2014 weren\u2019t selected from a pool of thousands of applicants and aren\u2019t dedicating much of their lives to the endeavor. Axiom itself has been more flippant about word usage in the past. \u201cCommercial human spaceflight. Space Tourism. Whatever you call it \u2014 it\u2019s happening. And soon,\u201d the company wrote on its website. What will they do while they\u2019re in space? Each of the crew members has a list of research projects they plan to work on.  Connor will be doing some research on how spaceflight affects senescent cells, which are cells that have ceased the normal replication process and are \u201clinked to multiple age-related diseases,\u201d according to Axiom. That research will be done in partnership with the Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic. Among the items on Pathy\u2019s to-do list is some additional medical research, focused more on children\u2019s health, that he\u2019ll conduct in partnership with several Canadian hospitals, and some conservation-awareness initiatives. Stibbe will also do some research and focus on \u201ceducational and artistic activities to connect the younger generation in Israel and around the globe,\u201d according to Axiom. Stibbe is flying on behalf of the Ramon Foundation \u2014 a space education non-profit named for Israel\u2019s first astronaut, Ilan Ramon, who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003. \u200bStibbe\u2019s Axiom bio says he and Ramon shared a \u201cclose\u201d friendship.  During downtime, the crew will also get a chance to enjoy sweeping views of Earth. And, at some point, they\u2019ll share a meal with the other astronauts on board. Their food was prepared in partnership with celebrity chef and philanthropist Jose Andr\u00e9s. Their meals \u201clean on flavors and traditional dishes of Commander L\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda\u2019s native Spain,\u201d according to Axiom.",

            "title": "Russia has lost 79 planes to sanctions",
            "text": "Sanctions put in place in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine have caused the nation\u2019s air carriers to lose 79 of their commercial jets, nearly 10% of their combined fleets. The sanctions by multiple countries require the international aircraft leasing companies that own the jets to have repossessed them by the end of March. All the repossessed jets were outside of Russia at the time, and the leasing companies have either repossessed them or started the process to do so in court, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm that tracks information about aircraft around the world.  When Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, Russia\u2019s air carriers were operating 861 commercial planes, both passenger and cargo jets, Cirium said. Just over half of those planes, with an estimated market value of $9.2 billion, were owned by non-Russian leasing companies. The Russian aviation industry depends on aircraft built in the West by companies such as Boeing and Airbus, but the planes are owned mostly by US and European leasing companies. The United States and most of Europe closed air space to Russia almost immediately after the invasion, and most of the jets at issue remained in Russia or quickly flew back there.  The Kremlin announced last month that it was nationalizing all the planes that the leasing companies were attempting to repossess and took titles of nearly 500 planes that were in Russia.  Most major leasing companies, including Air Lease Corp\n            \n                (AL)., Aviation Capital Group, Avolon and SMBC Aviation Capital, declined to comment on the planes they had repossessed or Russia\u2019s actions to nationalize the planes still in Russia.  Even some leasing companies in nations that haven\u2019t imposed sanctions on Russia, such as China and the United Arab Emirates, are moving to repossess as many jets as they can get their hands on. That\u2019s because the planes that remain in Russian control have been rendered essentially worthless due to other other sanctions imposed by Europe and the United States, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director with AeroDynamic Advisory. Those sanctions require aircraft makers Boeing\n            \n                (BA) and Airbus\n            \n                (EADSF), as well as engine makers such as General Electric\n            \n                (GE), to stop providing Russian air carriers with spare parts and service support. Russia has indicated it will service those planes internally, but the lack of authorized parts and servicing means that other countries will refuse to recognize the airworthiness certification that those planes need to fly outside of Russia. He said that it makes sense that the Chinese and Arab leasing companies want to repossess their Russian planes if they can, even if no sanctions require them to do so. It\u2019s also likely that many of the jets will be cannibalized for parts to keep some planes in the air, according to Aboulafia, a move that would transform the Russian aviation industry into \u201cthe world\u2019s largest chop shop.\u201d  Chinese and Arab leasing companies also want to keep good relations with the aircraft makers so that they don\u2019t encounter any problems buying planes for their customers outside of Russia. One Russian cargo jet owned by Singapore-based BOC Aviation, a unit of the Bank of China, was flown from Hong Kong and repossessed once it landed in California, according to a report from Reuters. Although Chinese companies don\u2019t want to directly confront Russia, said Aboulafia, they are looking to stay in the good graces of the global aviation industry. \u201cChina is clearly moving to support their Russian friends [by not imposing its own sanctions], but the friendship only goes so far,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is business.\u201d ",

On Tuesday, the company announced deals with three rocket companies that will launch those satellites. The agreement includes two veteran rocket builders \u2014 United Launch Alliance, which is joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and European company Arianespace \u2014 as well as Blue Origin, the rocket company started by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, which is still working to develop a rocket capable of reaching orbit.  Bezos remains the executive chairman of Amazon. The contracts include a total of up to 83 launches, which Amazon is calling one of the largest commercial launch deals ever inked. The launches will take place over about five years. All three rockets that Amazon plans to use for these missions are not in operation yet but are expected to enter service later this year or 2023. Financial details were not disclosed. In an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices and services, said only that the contracts will cost Amazon \u201cbillions.\u201d  He added that the company\u2019s goal is to launch a few test satellites to orbit within the next year or so. And, if all goes to plan, Amazon will deploy at least half the Project Kuiper constellation, or more than 1,600 satellites, by 2026. But the company can begin commercial services with just a few hundred satellites, Limp said. He declined to discuss how much the service might cost consumers.  \u201cWe still have lots of work ahead, but the team has continued to hit milestone after milestone across every aspect of our satellite system,\u201d Limp said in a statement. Notably absent from the list of providers is Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX. Though SpaceX has worked to dominate the commercial launch industry with its reusable rockets, Amazon\u2019s space-based internet business, called Project Kuiper, is expected to compete directly with SpaceX\u2019s own satellite internet business, Starlink. Starlink is well ahead of Project Kuiper and other competitors, as the company has already deployed more than 2,000 satellites and signed on more than 145,000 customers around the world, SpaceX said in January.  It\u2019s not uncommon, however, for a space company to launch a satellite on a competitor\u2019s rocket. SpaceX notably inked a deal to launch satellites for UK-based OneWeb, which is building yet another constellation of internet satellites in low-Earth orbit, the area of orbit extending out about 1,200 miles from the Earth\u2019s surface. (OneWeb made that agreement after its previous launch contract, which involved using Russian rockets, was canceled amid the Ukrainian war.)  Bezos and Musk, however, are thought to have a particularly fraught relationship, with Musk often making his barbs for Bezos public on Twitter and their companies engaging in tense competition for high-profile contracts with NASA and the US military.  Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper has been in quiet development for years. Federal regulators gave approval for the company to launch its satellites in 2020, and few concrete updates have been shared since.  Under the deal announced Tuesday, Arianespace, which has orbital rockets in operation but will plan to use its forthcoming Ariane 6 rocket for Project Kuiper launches, signed a deal for 18 missions. ULA got the lion\u2019s share of the deal, with plans for 38 launches. ULA will use its Vulcan Centaur rocket, which had been slated to fly in early 2022 but has been delayed by development hangups with the engines it will use \u2014 the BE-4 engine, which will be built by Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin. The Vulcan Centaur could fly for the first time later this year. Blue Origin will also use the BE-4 for its New Glenn rocket, which is now planned to enter service in 2023. Amazon signed a deal for 12 launches on that vehicle when it\u2019s ready to fly.",

Condor\u2019s fleet will soon be tricked out in candy-colored bold stripes, inspired by \u201cparasols, bath towels and beach chairs,\u201d according to the airline. Condor was owned by British holiday company Thomas Cook, which collapsed in 2019. Now the leisure airline is striking out on its own, with a new look to celebrate. The colorful stripes, designed by Berlin creative agency Vision Alphabet, aim to evoke nostalgia for vacations past and excitement for vacations of the future. There are five color options: Condor says the blue stripes represent the sea, the yellow stripes recall sunshine, red represents \u201cpassion\u201d, green represents \u201cisland\u201d and a beige-gold stripe should make travelers think of a sandy beach.

Beijing-based Space Transportation (aka Lingkong Tianxing in China) aims to make this prospect a reality with the development of a passenger-carrying vehicle that can hurtle across the skies at one mile per second \u2013 over twice the speed of Concorde. The firm has released an animated publicity video showing passengers (no helmet or spacesuits required) board what appears to be a 12-seater space plane that nestles underneath an aerodynamic delta-shaped structure, flanked by two titanic booster rockets.  The vehicle launches vertically into the heavens, and upon reaching cruise altitude, the space plane separates from its boosters and then skims the edge of space at 7,000 kilometers (4,350 miles) per hour, landing vertically at its destination with the aid of a tripod-type undercarriage.     According to Space Transportation\u2019s website, the company aims to launch its first suborbital space tourism test flight in 2025, followed by a \u201ccomplete full-scale global hypersonic vehicle flight by 2030.\u201d   The initiative, if realized, will be the embodiment of China\u2019s ambitions to straddle the potentially lucrative niches of space tourism as well as hypersonic point-to-point flight for business travelers, and is backed by significant players in the Chinese investment landscape.  Last August, the undertaking garnered over 300 million yuan (about $47 million) in initial financing, jointly led by a Shanghai-based industrial investment fund led by Matrix Partners China and the state-owned Shanghai Guosheng Group.     CNN has reached out to Space Transportation for further comment on its launch plans but has yet to receive a response.  It is rocket science China\u2019s longstanding association with rocket tech dates back to the battle of Kai-Keng in 1232, when the country fended off Mongol invaders using a barrage of \u201carrows of flying fire.\u201d  Chinese archers attached bamboo tubes stuffed with gunpowder to their arrows, which were ignited when launched.  In the present-day context of celestial rivalry, China\u2019s main adversaries are now the US and Russia, while the territory being contested is the stratosphere and lower Earth orbit.  The stakes are high, too. According to recent analysis by Emergen Research, \u201cthe global suborbital transportation and space tourism market revenue is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 16.8%, and market size is projected to increase from $423.7 million in 2020 to $1.44 billion in 2028.\u201d Space tourism on the rise  For now, suborbital flights as a means of getting from point A to point B are a ways off.  But space junkies have an ever-expanding universe of options to choose from to get their cosmic fix \u2013 ultra-high altitude space balloons, parabolic flights for weightlessness experiences, and soon, even space walks might be possible.  SpaceX\u2019s Polaris Dawn mission, slated to launch later this year from the historic Launch Complex 39A at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, will spend up to five days in orbit, during which time the crew will attempt the first commercial spacewalk. The mission is a stepping stone towards eventual missions to the moon, Mars and beyond. But whatever flavor of space tourism piques the interest of wannabe astronauts, ticket prices are astronomic. In December, for example, it was revealed that Grenada diplomat Justin Sun, founder of blockchain-based digital platform Tron, had placed a winning bid for a seat on Blue Origin\u2019s reusable New Shepard rocket.   The $28 million bid money went to Blue Origin\u2019s foundation, Club for the Future, which supports space-based charities to inspire future generations to pursue careers in STEM. Sun and five crewmates will fly on the New Shepard spaceship later this year. Getting closer to the stars, last December, Japanese fashion magnate Yusaku Maezawa, his producer Yozo Hirano, and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin returned safely to Earth in a Russian Soyuz capsule after having spent 12 days on the International Space Station at a round-trip cost in the ballpark of $80 million. And for those on a more modest budget, Virgin Galactic is offering 90-minute space flights, commencing in Q4 this year, at $450,000 a pop.  \u201cDemand for space travel is strong, and we\u2019ve been selling seats ahead of the pace we had planned,\u201d says Michael Colglazier, CEO of Virgin Galactic, in a statement. The company claims that approximately 700 seats have been sold to date. But with the high cost of access to space, the market is, at least for now, seen as the exclusive preserve of the super affluent. \u201cSpace tourism is still an emerging area and is very much a billionaire\u2019s turf,\u201d John H. Schmidt, global aerospace and defense industry lead at Accenture, tells CNN.  \u201cWhile space tourism will likely ramp up, it will take considerable time until costs dramatically drop to reach a far broader audience of passengers than the billionaire-set.\u201d  China gears up for hypersonic passenger flights And that\u2019s where China comes into the picture, with its demonstrable knack for identifying and formulating a scaled-up response to new market opportunities, and driving down prices for consumers.  China is already a significant player in space, with a nationally sponsored road map that supports a spectrum of initiatives, including satellite technologies, moon and Mars landings, interplanetary voyages and deep space exploration.  In a white paper published by the State Council Information Office, China outlines its plans for bolstering its space economy objectives, and these include high-speed transporting of humans. With space tourism\u2019s lucrative potential, it\u2019s hardly surprising that China has been ramping up resources and facilities to enable advancement of its own space plane proposition.  In March 2018, for example, China revealed that it was building a 265-meter-long wind tunnel, which can be used to test scale model hypersonic aircraft prototypes at speeds of up to Mach 25 (30,625 kph) at China\u2019s State Key Laboratory of High Temperature Gas Dynamics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. \u201cHypersonic aircraft may be on the horizon, but we\u2019re still at a very early stage. One of the big challenges is that this area requires rare skills. Governments are investing in research and pilot projects to explore what\u2019s possible and develop the skills to someday build production hypersonic aircraft,\u201d says Accenture\u2019s Schmidt. The viability of hypersonic business travel But what about the broader prospects for space planes?  Executive travelers salivating at the possibility of significantly reducing their travel time (and experiencing breathtaking views of the planet along the way) now have a growing body of evidence to support the business case for high-Mach-speed business flights: Last year, NASA published the findings of two extensive and independent market studies into commercial hypersonic transportation. The first study, produced by Deloitte and based upon work supported by NASA, quantifies the viability for business flights at a range of ultra-high speeds, modeling the business cases for all combinations of three primary variables: cruise Mach number (2.0 to 5.5); passenger capacity (20, 50 and 100) and range (2,500 to 9,000 nautical miles).  The study concluded that there is enough sustainable demand for high-speed transportation and that \u201cdemand will likely come from scheduled air passenger transportation (i.e. airline services) and private jet operations, inclusive of charter services, jet card or membership models.\u201d  The analysis noted that transoceanic, global \u201ccrown jewel\u201d routes are the likely market entry points for scheduled air transportation services, with New York-London; Miami-Sao Paulo; New York-Paris; Los Angeles-Sydney; and Sydney-Singapore being the most promising city pairs for hypersonic flights. The report identified a total addressable market of 90 transoceanic routes that includes 2.25 million annual passengers and a potential for $16.5 billion in revenue. And from an airline operator\u2019s perspective, the study concluded that \u201chigh-speed aircraft that are priced below $146 million remain attractive to operators and individuals alike.\u201d The second NASA study, produced by BryceTech and SAIC, modeled future demand and business operations at speeds between Mach 2 and Mach 7, forecasting premium air travel demand through the year 2060 and assessing the willingness of passengers of different income and wealth levels to pay to save time on flights. That analysis found that more than 300 city pairs can support high-speed commercial and general aviation.  Time is of the essence \u201cThe question is, how many thousands of people a day are willing to pay a full first class fare; would they be willing to pay twice that much to go three or four times as fast? I think that ratio is important,\u201d says Adam Dissel, president of Reaction Engines Inc. Reaction Engines is a significant player in the global hypersonic ecosystem with its hydrogen-powered \u2018SABRE (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine)\u2019 a new class of engine for propelling both high speed aircraft and spacecraft. SABRE is unique in delivering the fuel efficiency of a jet engine with the power and high-speed ability of a rocket engine, designed for spaceplanes that can take off from a runway and go all the way to five times the speed of sound.   The SABRE, Dissel tells CNN, \u201cis an extremely natural fit for both high-speed point-to-point systems and for suborbital or orbital systems. It\u2019s the first of its type and it\u2019s a big enterprise to invent a new propulsion cycle from scratch.\u201d Dissel points to the main advantage between flying hypersonically vs supersonically by noting that \u201cConcorde was a Mach 2-ish kind of aircraft. But you have to factor in arriving at the airport ahead of time, and the fact that Concorde had to take off, accelerate, climb \u2013 it wasn\u2019t moving at Mach 2 the entire flight.\u201d  Traveling from New York to London, instead of 10 hours from airport door to airport door, supersonic only changed that to seven hours, but it didn\u2019t give the business traveler their day back.  \u201cHowever,\u201d says Dissel, \u201cif you can start pushing above Mach 4, you get to a point where you actually could leave the East Coast of the US in the morning, be in London for afternoon meetings, and then be back home that same day. And so it\u2019s a question of valuing time.\u201d Environmental sensibilities While the time-saving benefits of hypersonic flight are irrefutable, the technical and regulatory hurdles ahead for hypersonic travel are numerous. NASA\u2019s market studies have identified a long checklist of hurdles to overcome, including sonic boom restrictions when flying over populated areas; safety certification; emissions concerns; and worries over operating at significantly higher altitudes where there\u2019s the danger of exposure to radiation.  Additionally, there are challenges of having to build the space planes using special materials to cope with the speed and heat friction generated at high Mach speed. And then there would also have to be special pilot training for flying at the threshold of space.  Most of these challenges are technical, which means they\u2019re surmountable at a price. But unlike in the age of Concorde, whose design and development was propped up with an almost limitless supply of public money injected from British and French taxpayers, tomorrow\u2019s hypersonic space planes will mainly be financed through the private sector. The other major difference is that unlike the 1960s, present day sensibilities are more focused around air travel\u2019s environmental impact. The optics won\u2019t look good if hypersonic travelers brag on social media about their two-hour flight from Beijing to Dubai if they\u2019re going to provoke spaceflight shaming because they\u2019ve polluted the planet in the process. \u201cAll these companies are trying various methods to offer both the highest speed system and also one that, at least end to end, has a better environmental footprint,\u201d says Dissel.  One of the most critically important determinants of the uptake and eventual success of hypersonic flight, Dissel suggests, \u201cis trying to figure out how you go to zero carbon fuels \u2013 that\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to solve.\u201d  The journey of a thousand miles begins \u2026 Where does all this leave China\u2019s aspirations as it stakes its place in the civil space economy? While Space Transportation (Lingkong Tianxing) has its work cut out for it addressing the technicalities to bring its space plane to market as a privately funded venture, it does appear to have the blessing of the state behind it.  And that could be a differentiating factor.  To overcome the long list of hurdles to make hypersonic flight a reality for the broader business travel market \u2013 and not just for an elite cohort of super-rich space tourists \u2013 the world\u2019s competing space plane builders are going to need deep pockets.",

The huge train of tires on which the aircraft sits is still visible, as is the tattered nose cone, proudly bearing Ukrainian blue and yellow stripes and the \u201c225\u201d of its official designation.  But it\u2019s clear the world\u2019s largest commercial airplane, the Antonov AN-225, will never fly again.  The full extent of the damage to the aircraft, named \u201cMriya,\u201d or \u201cdream\u201d in Ukrainian, was seen by CNN journalists after Russian troops withdrew last week from Hostomel airfield outside Kyiv, which was among the first strategic targets of the invasion of Ukraine.  The jet plane lies crumpled and broken beneath the shattered arch of an aircraft hangar, where it had been awaiting maintenance at the time of the invasion. Around it lies the detritus of war \u2013 the airfield is littered with destroyed Russian hardware, including trucks, tanks, armored personnel carriers and spent munitions.  The AN-225\u2019s destruction was a symbolic loss in the early throes of conflict. The aircraft, originally built to support the 1980s Soviet space shuttle program, had been a symbol of pride for Ukraine. It also sent shockwaves through the world of aviation. The aircraft had been celebrated as a marvel of modern aerial engineering, regularly attracting crowds both at air shows where it was the star attraction and during its day-to-day cargo missions around the world.   Symbolic status Immediately following reports of its demise, Ukrainian authorities vowed to rebuild the plane, saying Russia would be made to foot the $3 billion cost of reconstruction.  \u201cRussia may have destroyed our \u2018Mriya\u2019. But they will never be able to destroy our dream of a strong, free and democratic European state. We shall prevail!\u201d wrote Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Twitter at the time. Russian troops began digging in at Hostomel shortly after gaining control of the airfield in late February. Following weeks of intense fighting, satellite images revealed last Thursday that Russian forces had suddenly disappeared.  Previous satellite images showed that, around military vehicles and artillery positions, the Russians had constructed protective earthen berms. Now, just the berms remain.   Ukrainian forces have since taken control of the facility, claiming it as a significant victory over the Russians. At the weekend, CNN journalists toured the airfield with Ukrainian National Police. It was not clear what caused the airplane\u2019s destruction \u2013 whether it was an act of deliberate sabotage or collateral damage from the military offensive to take control of the airfield.  But despite the AN-255\u2019s dilapidated state, many soldiers were taking photographs of the aircraft, Mriya\u2019s symbolic status among Ukrainians clearly undiminished",

            "text": "Alaska Airlines canceled dozens of flights this weekend as its pilots held informational pickets in numerous cities throughout the United States in an almost 3-year-long deadlock in contract negotiations with the airline.  On Friday, Alaska Air canceled 111 flights, or 15% of its operations, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. In comparison, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines canceled only 4% of their flights operations the same day.  As of noon EST Saturday, Alaska Airlines canceled 77 flights, or 11% of its operations.   Alaska Airlines said 12,000 customers were affected by the cancellations. There was no mention of the pilot walkout in its statement. \u201cWe know the sudden cancellation of their travel plans is frustrating \u2013 we apologize to all of our guests who we let down,\u201d Alaska Airlines said in a statement to CNN Business.  Hundreds of pilots and crew members held informational picketing events in Anchorage, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Portland, Oregon, on Friday, the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), which represents Alaska Airlines pilots, said in a statement.  Photos of pilots picketing at airports such as Portland International Airport show the pilots holding signs that say \u201cBreak the stall contract now\u201d and \u201cValue your pilots.\u201d  The union has been negotiating with the airline for the past three years.  \u201cAlaska Airlines pilots have been crucial in the overwhelming success of this airline and have earned a new contract that recognizes our contributions. The contract improvements we seek are reasonable, and affordable, and will allow our airline to remain successful and competitive,\u201d said Will McQuillen, chairman of the Alaska ALPA Master Executive Council, in a statement.  As airlines struggle to keep up with a surge of post-pandemic travel, the Alaska Air pilots are advocating for \u201cjob security, stronger work rules and enhanced quality-of-life provisions\u201d such as flexibility and reasonable schedules. The union said their contract falls behind competitor airlines.  \u201cThree years is too long to be negotiating a contract without reaching agreement,\u201d McQuillen said. Alaska Airlines said in a statement that it is committed to reaching a contract with the pilots, but it\u2019s vital for the company to negotiate a deal that allows for company profitability. The average captain\u2019s pay is $341,000 a year. The union represents 3,100 pilots at the carrier. \u201cWe\u2019ve put a package on the table that\u2019s competitive and addresses the issues most important to our pilots,\u201d said Jenny Wetzel, vice president of labor relations for Alaska Airlines. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant financial investment in our pilot group while recognizing that we are still working to recover from $2.3 billion in losses from the COVID-19 pandemic. We are eager to conclude negotiations quickly so our pilots can enjoy these new benefits as soon as possible.\u201d   ALPA is the largest airline union in the world, representing more than 62,000 pilots in North America.

            "text": "Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin just launched its fourth successful space tourism mission, putting yet another feather in the cap of the company that hopes to make these supersonic joyrides a mainstay of pop culture.  The six passengers, which include a Blue Origin engineer and five paying customers, boarded their New Shepard capsule Thursday just after sunrise at the company\u2019s West Texas launch facilities. Boosted by a 60-foot-tall rocket, they soared to more than three times the speed of sound, or more than 2,000 miles per hour. Their capsule vaulted past the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Line at 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) altitude, which is widely recognized as the altitude at which outer space begins. And at the peak of the flight, they experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and, out their window, sweeping Earthly views. It\u2019s not clear how much the trip cost the five paying customers. Blue Origin has not publicly disclosed a fixed per-seat price point, though it had auctioned off a ticket for $28 million. But that was for a seat to ride alongside Bezos himself, and the auction winner didn\u2019t end up going. (He is slated to fly later this year, however.) Blue Origin\u2019s direct competitor, Virgin Galactic, is currently selling seats for $450,000, up from its previous price point of around $250,000.  This flight had been slated to include Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson, but he dropped out of the mission after Blue Origin announced a schedule change earlier this month. The company cited the need for additional ground tests on the New Shepard rocket as the reason for the delay.  Gary Lai, who has been with Blue Origin for 18 years and holds several patents related to the New Shepard rocket\u2019s design, flew in Davidson\u2019s place and was the sole non-paying customer on the flight. Lai\u2019s crewmates included Marty Allen, an investor and the former CEO of a party supply store; Jim Kitchen, an entrepreneur and business professor; George Nield, a former associate administrator for the Federal Aviation Administration Office of Commercial Space Transportation; Marc Hagle, an Orlando real estate developer, and his wife, Sharon Hagle, who founded a space-focused nonprofit. The passengers\u2019 New Shepard capsule, which is fully autonomous, deployed plumes of parachutes after diving back into the thickest part of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and landed with a puff of sand in the Texas desert. On the livestream, the passengers could be heard cheering as the capsule made its touchdown, and moments later, they exited the capsule, smiling and waving.  \u201cIt was intense, and I did get a little bit of a feeling of vertigo,\u201d Lai told Blue Origin\u2019s Sarah Knights, who heads communications with the passengers during flight. \u201cI did feel a little bit nauseous, for sure.\u201d Other passengers on the livestream described the view as \u201cincredible.\u201d \u201cUnreal, just unreal,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI can\u2019t put it into words.\u201d \u201cIt was an out-of-body experience,\u201d Kitchen said. He described outer space as the \u201cblackest black I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d adding that it was \u201cbreathtaking.\u201d Nield called it \u201cthe thrill of a lifetime.\u201d \u201cPictures don\u2019t do it justice,\u201d he added. What does this all mean? Business activity in space \u2014 largely led by SpaceX \u2014 is booming. From building cheaper rockets and designing new uses for satellites to imagining futuristic space hotels, the industry has attracted record levels of investment, according to data collected by analytics firm Space Capital.  After years of quiet development, Blue Origin\u2019s space tourism rocket made its crewed launch debut last year with Bezos, flying alongside a heroine of the space community, Wally Funk, as well as his brother Mark Bezos and a paying customer.  Since then, Blue Origin made headlines for flying other well-known names on two subsequent flights, including Star Trek star William Shatner and Good Morning America host Michael Strahan.  Strahan wrote a message for the passengers on Thursday\u2019s flight that was read to them by ground control: \u201cThis is the best ride you will ever have, but it\u2019s way too short.\u201d Blue Origin\u2019s goal is to make these suborbital spaceflights a mainstay of pop culture, giving a 10-minute supersonic joyride to invited guests \u2014 who thus far have mostly been celebrities \u2014 and anyone else who can afford it. Blue Origin is the first company to begin offering regular suborbital space tourism flights. Its chief competitor, Virgin Galactic, notably had its first crewed flight \u2014 which included founder Richard Branson \u2014 before Bezos\u2019 flight last July. But Virgin Galactic has yet to follow up that flight with another crewed flight after it later became clear that the company\u2019s space plane had traveled out of its designated flight path. The company now says it\u2019s undergoing unrelated technology upgrades and may return to flight later this year. SpaceX is the only private company that offers trips to orbit. The company completed the first-ever all-civilian flight to orbit last September, taking a billionaire and three of his chosen crewmates on a three-day trip. And next week, the company plans to take four paying customers on a flight to the International Space Station, which orbits about 200 miles above Earth. Blue Origin does have plans to build a rocket powerful enough to reach orbit, called the New Glenn. And, in light of the news that Russia may no longer sell rocket engines to the United States, those plans are more pressing than ever. The engines Blue Origin plans to use for the New Glenn, the BE-4, will also be used on an upcoming launch vehicle designed by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing that is responsible for significant US national security launches.

            "text": "Cathay Pacific may be about to operate the world\u2019s longest commercial flight by redirecting its regular service from its hometown of Hong Kong to New York over the Atlantic \u2013 a route that would steer clear of Russian airspace \u2013 instead of taking its usual path over the Pacific. Although it has yet to fully commit to the route, Cathay says its transatlantic flightpath would cover just under 9,000 nautical miles \u2013 equivalent to 10,357 standard miles or 16,668 kilometers. If confirmed, that would exceed the current world\u2019s longest flight for distance, which is 9,534 standard miles between Singapore and New York.  While many airlines have avoided Russian airspace in the wake of the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 many due to reciprocal air blockades \u2013 Cathay said its rerouting was down to favorable wind conditions.  \u201cWe are always running contingency routings for potential events or scenarios within the world of aviation,\u201d a representative for the airline told CNN in a statement. \u201cWe compare flight routes daily, and will plan and fly what is the most efficient routing on the day,\u201d \u201cThe transatlantic option relies on the facilitation of strong seasonal tailwinds at this time of the year in order for the flight time to be between 16 and 17 hours, thereby making it more favorable than the transpacific route. We are monitoring the tailwinds situation on a daily basis as it is already tapering off. \u201cOur Airbus A350-1000 aircraft can comfortably accomplish this in 16 to 17 hours with similar fuel consumption to the transpacific flights.\u201d  Cathay, unlike other airlines, has declined to clarify whether its planes will intentionally bypass Russia. China and Russia have remained on good diplomatic terms since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine began in February.  That\u2019s not the only new contender for the world\u2019s longest flight. As air travel around the world gets going again, 2022 has seen more and more long flights unveiled. Just this week, two new announcements were made for new ultra-long-haul flights. Air New Zealand\u2019s 17-hour-plus nonstop between Auckland and JFK will begin in September 2022, while Qantas\u2019 Melbourne-to-Dallas direct will kick off in December. Currently, the longest flight record holder is the Singapore Airlines direct flight between Changi Airport and JFK. CNN\u2019s Richard Quest flew on the Airbus A350-900URL in October 2018, clocking more than 17 hours on board between the two cities.  Top image credit: Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images",

            "text": "It\u2019s huge, it\u2019s wide, and it\u2019s potentially a lot more sustainable. The Airbus A380, a behemoth of the skies, has completed a trial flight powered on cooking oil. The test airplane completed a three-hour flight from Blagnac Airport in Toulouse \u2013 Airbus\u2019 French headquarters \u2013 on 25 March. It was powered by Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF \u2013 predominantly made of used cooking oil and waste fats \u2013 and operating on a single Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine. Airbus then followed up with a second A380 flight, using the same cooking oil fuel, on March 29, flying from Toulouse to Nice. The second flight was to monitor SAF use during take-off and landing.  The fuel used was supplied by TotalEnergies, a company based in France\u2019s Normandy region. It was made from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), which is free of both aromatics and sulfur. Airbus has been testing the use of SAF-powered flights for the last year, with an A350 being tested in March 2021, and an A319neo single-aisle aircraft flying on cooking oil in October. The company hopes to get its aircraft certified to fly on SAF by the end of the decade. Currently, Airbus aircraft can be powered by up to 50% SAF, blended with traditional kerosene.   \u201cIncreasing the use of SAF remains a key pathway to achieving the industry\u2019s ambition of netzero carbon emissions by 2050,\u201d said Airbus in a statement. The company claims that flying planes on SAF could net between 53% to 71% of the carbon reductions required to meet that goal.  Airbus plans to bring the world\u2019s first zero-emission aircraft to market by 2035. SAF, which claims carbon neutrality because of the CO2 absorbed while its organic ingredients are being grown, is already being used in limited amounts by some airlines. But high prices mean that widespread adoption isn\u2019t expected anytime soon.  The world\u2019s largest passenger airplane, the A380\u2019s fortunes have been in decline in recent years with several airlines calling time on their use, partly on the grounds that they\u2019re less fuel efficient than more modern long-range airplanes. Airbus delivered the final ever A380 to Dubai airline Emirates in late 2021. More recently, Airbus announced that the giant plane would be pressed into service to test an experimental hydrogen-powered engine, another innovation aimed at making flying less environmentally harmful.

            "text": "Canada has picked Lockheed Martin Corp as the preferred bidder to supply 88 new fighter jets, Procurement Minister Filomena Tassi said Monday, in a clear sign the US company is set to win the multibillion-dollar contract. The move indicates Canada \u2013 under pressure to boost defense spending as the war in Ukraine rages \u2013 is closer to making a decision that has dragged out for more than a decade. \u201cThis announcement marks another important milestone in Canada\u2019s competitive process to purchase modern fighter jets for the Royal Canadian Air Force,\u201d Tassi said. Canada has been trying unsuccessfully for more than a decade to replace its aging F-18 fighters. The former Conservative administration said in 2010 that it would buy 65 F-35 jets but later scrapped the decision, triggering years of delays and reviews. \u201cThe F-35 is in operational use by NORAD and NATO partners in missions around the globe. It has proven to be a mature, capable and interoperable aircraft and that is why we are moving to the finalization phase of this procurement,\u201d Defense Minister Anita Anand, speaking alongside Tassi, told reporters. The federal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will now only hold detailed talks with Lockheed Martin. Ottawa says it hopes to award the contract this year and take first deliveries in 2025.  Defense sources had long bet on the US company, given Canada belongs to the consortium that developed its F-35 jet and the fact the plane is the military\u2019s first choice. Ottawa says the contract could be worth up to $19 billion Canadian dollars (about $15 billion). \u201cWe look forward to continuing our partnership with Canadian industry to deliver and sustain the F-35 for the Royal Canadian Air Force,\u201d Lockheed Martin Canada chief executive Lorraine Ben said in a statement. If the negotiations for some reason fail, the government will turn to Sweden\u2019s Saab, the other contender. \u201cWhile we maintain our position that Saab presented the best offer for the Future Fighter Capability Project, we respect the decision of the government of Canada,\u201d the Swedish company said in a statement, adding that it would continue to collaborate with Canada in current and future programs. Canada though has a long history of using US military equipment and, unlike Sweden, belongs to both NATO and NORAD, the North American defense organization. Trudeau came to power in 2015 vowing not to buy the F-35 as too expensive but has shifted his position. The obvious alternative would have been Boeing but it fell out of favor after taking trade action against Canadian rival Bombardier and was excluded from the competition last December.",

            "text": "Pete Davidson was initially slated to be the next headline-grabbing name to take flight aboard the suborbital space tourism rocket developed by Jeff Bezos\u2019 company, Blue Origin, after the commercial space company launched several other famous faces on its previous flights.  But the comedian abruptly dropped out of the mission after a schedule change pushed the flight back by a week. His seat was given to longtime company employee Gary Lai, the chief architect of the very rocket he\u2019ll fly on. Lai will be joined by five paying customers who had the means to dish out an undisclosed sum for one of the coveted crew capsule seats.   Liftoff of the New Shepard launch vehicle had been scheduled for Tuesday morning, but the company said that it\u2019s expecting rough winds at its facilities near Van Horn, Texas at that time. Blue Origin is now targeting Thursday at 8:30 am CT. Those interested in catching the action \u2014 which is expected to look much like Blue Origin\u2019s three earlier suborbital jaunts \u2014 can tune into Blue Origin\u2019s webcast Thursday morning. The flight will be brief. It\u2019s an approximately 10-minute up-and-down excursion that will kick off with the rocket firing up its engines and reaching more than three times the speed of sound as it propels the crew\u2019s capsule to more than 60 miles above the Earth\u2019s surface. The passengers will experience a few minutes of weightlessness and sweeping views of the planet below, before gravity drags them back to Earth and the capsule deploys parachutes to ensure a gentle landing near the launch site.  It\u2019s not immediately clear how much the paying customers on this mission forked over, and Blue Origin has not disclosed a fixed ticket price. But we do know at least one would-be passenger won an auction for a ticket to fly alongside Bezos last year for a whopping $28 million. (That passenger, however, did not end up flying on Bezos\u2019 flight.) We also know another player in the suborbital space tourism game, Virgin Galactic, is selling its seats for $450,000 a piece. Whether the passengers paid a few hundred thousand bucks or a few million, it\u2019s safe to say that these missions won\u2019t be affordable for the average consumer anytime soon. Here is a look at some of the next space tourists set to launch on Blue Origin\u2019s mission on Thursday. Gary Lai Lai, the only non-paying passenger on Thursday\u2019s suborbital flight, was among the first 20 employees at Blue Origin after joining the company in 2004. He\u2019s been credited as the \u201carchitect of the New Shepard system,\u201d and holds multiple patents related to the launch vehicle, according to a statement from Blue Origin. During his time as an undergraduate at Cornell University, Lai studied under the prolific late astronomer Carl Sagan.  Lai will be the second Asian-American passenger to voyage to the edge of space on a suborbital spaceflight, after Virgin Galactic employee and Indian-American aeronautical engineer Sirisha Bandla joined Richard Branson on his spaceflight last year. The industry is running abruptly into societal issues for largely being accessible to the white, male and wealthy, so far. Marty Allen Marty Allen is an angel investor and former chief executive of a party supply store and a closet design company. The Pennsylvania native now lives in California. In an interview with Philadelphia-based local news station WPVI-TV, Allen said that visiting space has been a dream of his since childhood. \u201cI\u2019ve loved aviation from the time I was a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to build rockets and play with them as a kid. I always dreamed about space.\u201d Allen added that each passenger was given a small bag to take aboard the suborbital trip, and revealed that he is packing his with an American flag that is 60 feet by 10 feet to bring along on the journey. \u201cI\u2019m going to take it up with me, and when I come back home, I\u2019m going to erect a really big flagpole on my property and fly that flag,\u201d Allen told the local news outlet. Jim Kitchen Jim Kitchen is an entrepreneur and faculty member of the University of North Carolina\u2019s Kenan-Flagler Business School, where he teaches classes on how to start \u201csocial entrepreneurial ventures and raise funding,\u201d according to his university bio. An avid traveler who documents his trips on Instagram, Kitchen has visited all 193 U.N. member countries. But like the other passengers, he says visiting space has been a longtime dream. \u201cOne of my earliest childhood memories was sitting in my mom\u2019s lap at the beach in Florida and watching an Apollo mission launch, just looking up and seeing that rocket go up to space,\u201d Kitchen said in an interview with a UNC business school publication.  While he\u2019s already seen much of Earth from down below, he said he\u2019s really excited about viewing the planet from above.  \u201cGiven everything that\u2019s going on right now in the world, seeing this borderless planet from space is really important to me,\u201d Kitchen said.  George Nield George Nield is the president and founder of Commercial Space Technologies, a company that aims to promote and facilitate commercial space activities. He previously worked as an associate administrator for the Federal Aviation Administration Office of Commercial Space Transportation, according to Blue Origin, where he was responsible for licensing and regulating commercial launch activities.  While he spent much of his career on the regulatory side of the budding space tourism sector, Nield expressed excitement about finally being able to experience the \u201cmagic\u201d of the journey firsthand.  \u201cSome folks have asked me why I would want to go on a suborbital spaceflight,\u201d he wrote in a March 14 tweet. \u201cHere\u2019s my answer: To see black sky and the curvature of the Earth, and to experience the \u2018magic\u2019 of weightlessness.\u201d Sharon Hagle  Sharon Hagle will be lifting off alongside her husband, Marc Hagle, on Thursday\u2019s flight \u2013 making them the first married couple to jointly fly on a commercial spaceflight.  She is the founder of SpaceKids Global, a nonprofit that works to encourage students \u2013 and especially young girls \u2013 to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics (so-called STEAM programs). The organization hosts national essay competitions and organizes speaking engagements at schools aimed to inspire the the next generation to pursue careers in the space industry.  Sharon Hagle has the goal of experiencing spaceflight via all three companies currently operating in the arena: Blue Origin, SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, per per her SpaceKids Global bio. Marc Hagle Marc Hagle is the chief executive of a residential and commercial property development firm based in the Orlando, Florida area. Some fifteen years ago, the Hagles reserved tickets to fly on a future Virgin Galactic flight after they celebrated a wedding anniversary by experiencing near-weightlessness aboard a Zero Gravity Corp. jet, he told his local newspaper Florida Today. Now that the couple\u2019s longtime dream of experiencing spaceflight are coming into fruition, Marc Hagle told Florida Today, \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you how excited we are.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019re very honored to be able to do it,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we\u2019re having a lot of fun with it.\u201d",

            "text": "Tech stocks have taken a tumble this year, but some investing experts say there are now plenty of good values in the sector. You just have to look beyond the increasingly tired MT. FAANG stocks. The FAANG part of the acronym refers to the first letters of the tickers of Facebook\n            \n                (FB) (now known as Meta), Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN), Apple\n            \n                (AAPL), Netflix\n            \n                (NFLX) and Google\n            \n                (GOOGL) owner Alphabet.  Mark Lehmann, CEO of Citizens Financial-owned investment bank JMP Securities, adds Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT) and Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) to the mix to come up with the mountain nickname. But he thinks it may be time for investors to climb down from MT. FAANG and consider other companies in the tech sector. \u201cThere\u2019s been an overwhelming love affair with some of these stocks irrespective of where they\u2019ve traded,\u201d Lehmann said. The tech sector is bigger than these seven giants, and Lehmann noted it doesn\u2019t make sense to lump this group together \u2014 after all, they\u2019re very different from one another. Some, most notably Meta and Netflix, now face some big competitive challenges that are hurting their stocks. \u201cThere has been a decoupling lately with Facebook struggling,\u201d he said.  Forget the FAANGs So what are some of the tech stocks that investors should be considering instead? Lehmann said JMP analysts are bullish on Venmo owner PayPal\n            \n                (PYPL), noting that younger consumers are increasingly shunning cash. \u201cPayPal has the best payment system,\u201d he said. \u201cMy kids will Venmo their friends 90 cents. It\u2019s a part of their life. They are not going to the bank.\u201d Lehmann said several other mid-sized techs including DocuSign\n            \n                (DOCU), software firm Snowflake, LegalZoom and online insurer Lemonade, are examples of tech stocks that have fallen sharply this year but now may be decent bargains. Other analysts still see good values in cybersecurity stocks, especially due to growing concerns about threats from Russia, which some fear may look to retaliate against the West with cyberattacks due to sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. \u201cBetween geopolitical concerns and an increased digital transformation of the economy, there are long-term secular tailwinds for cybersecurity,\u201d said Ivana Delevska, founder and chief investment officer of Spear Invest. According to the firm\u2019s website, the Spear Alpha ETF owns shares of cybersecurity companies Crowdstrike\n            \n                (CRWD) and Zscaler\n            \n                (ZS).  More M&A means value in takeover targets and acquirers The security sector may also benefit as larger tech firms look to bulk up and make acquisitions. Google recently announced it was buying Mandiant, the security firm formerly known as FireEye, for example.  Lehmann said that several large techs, which have tons of cash on their balance sheet, may look to do more deals as well. Microsoft recently acquired video game leader Activision Blizzard\n            \n                (ATVI).  And on Monday, PC and printer giant HP\n            \n                (HPQ) scooped up Poly, the headset maker formerly known as Plantronics. Shares of Poly soared more than 50% on the news. \u201cTech takeovers are alive and well,\u201d Lehmann said.  With that in mind, one fund manager said that investors might want to buy the companies that are in good position to make deals\u2026older tech firms with strong balance sheets.  \u201c\u201dWhen you see bouts of volatility like this year, that creates more of a stock picker\u2019s market. There are great values in high quality tech stocks, not the super growth momentum stocks,\u201d said Frank Lee, head of the investment strategy group at Miracle Mile Advisors. \u201cYou want the companies that are generating cash now, and look for ones paying dividends,\u201d Lee added.

The Australian airline, which is nicknamed \u201cthe flying kangaroo,\u201d announced the new route will begin on December 2, 2022 and will be serviced by Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Customers continuing on to other cities in North America can connect with Qantas partner American Airlines, which has a major hub at DFW. Though Qantas offers several long-haul flights to the United States, this is the first time in history that a commercial airline has organized a nonstop between Dallas and Melbourne.  This announcement highlights the news that Dallas, as CNN\u2019s Richard Quest could tell you, is currently having what one might call \u201ca moment.\u201d And it\u2019s also great news for Melbourne, which endured six lockdowns over a nine-month period during the pandemic.    \u201cNo city in the world did it tougher during Covid than Melbourne, but no city is bouncing back as quickly,\u201d Qantas group chief customer officer Stephanie Tully said in a press statement.  She added: \u201cWe are seeing really strong demand from Melburnians wanting to travel overseas for a holiday or business trip after two years at home.\u201d Australia began slowly reopening its borders to fully vaccinated international travelers in February.  The MEL-DFW direct route clocks in around the 17-hour mark, which will add it to the list of the world\u2019s longest flights. Tickets for the inaugural flight are on sale now.  Last week, Air New Zealand added a new route to the ultra long-haul club, announcing plans to launch direct flights between Auckland and New York City \u2013 a first for the Kiwi airline. Flights leaving JFK for Auckland will clock in at 17 hours and 35 minutes.  Currently, the longest passenger flight in the world runs between Singapore and JFK on Singapore Airlines. It covers 9,534 miles and spends about 18 hours in the air.   Australia\u2019s national flag carrier, which celebrated its 100th birthday in 2020, has made no secret of its desire to push the boundaries of long-haul travel. \u201cProject Sunrise,\u201d Qantas\u2019 plan to operate nonstop flights between Sydney and London, was derailed by the pandemic, but the airline still hopes to resurrect it. During the pandemic, Qantas, like many airlines around the world, got creative in order to stay afloat and keep staff employed.

            "text": "Another Boeing plane has been grounded after a fatal crash, this time in China. That may be the least of the company\u2019s problems in a crucial market.  The decision to ground the Boeing model 737-800 was made by China Eastern Airlines, which operated the jet that crashed March 21, killing all 132 on board. The cause of the crash has yet to be determined, and the grounding could be lifted soon if it turns out the cause was not mechanical. But Boeing has plenty of other troubles in China, the world\u2019s largest aviation market. It is on the verge of being virtually shut out of the region as trade tensions between the United States and China have basically halted Boeing sales in the country for the last four years. The company has not announced any sales to a Chinese passenger airline since November 2017. Only six months ago, Boeing projected the Chinese market would be worth $1.5 trillion in commercial aircraft purchases over the next 20 years.  It takes a long time to build and deliver planes after they\u2019re ordered, and Boeing continued to deliver jets to China\u2019s airlines and leasing companies in 2018 and early 2019. But only 40 of them have been delivered since March 2019. That\u2019s when aviation authorities around the globe grounded Boeing\u2019s bestselling jet, the 737 Max, after two fatal crashes were found to have been caused by a design flaw. That grounding stretched on for 20 months. The US Federal Aviation Administration cleared the plane to carry passengers again in November 2020, with most other countries\u2019 aviation authorities following close behind. Airlines that owned the 737 Max were soon flying the plane again.  But not in China, where the aviation regulator \u2014 one of the first to ground the Max after the second accident \u2014 waited another year to clear the plane to fly. Chinese airlines that own the planes still have not returned them to service. \u201cWe would now expect further delays to Chinese reinstatement of the 737 Max while this accident is investigated, at least until a likely cause is identified,\u201d said a note this week from Melius Research. Key market Losing a market as important as China would be a devastating blow to Boeing\n            \n                (BA), which has been hit by one problem after another over the last three years, starting with the 737 Max crashes and then the pandemic, which all but obliterated demand for flying and devastated the finances of its airline customers. More recently, there have been issues with its latest model, the 787 Dreamliner, halting deliveries. In 2017 and 2018 China accounted for more than 20% of Boeing\u2019s global deliveries, but since the start of 2020 the percentage has dropped to below 5%. (Boeing gets most of its revenue when a plane is delivered.) Some experts believe Boeing has reached agreements to sell some planes to Chinese airlines in the last four years, either through a leasing company or via sales in which the name of the buyer is not made public. But no aircraft orders are official without approval from the Chinese government, which views plane sales as leverage in its negotiations with the United States on overall trade issues, said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst with AeroDynamic Advisory.  Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told investors in October, \u201cWe remain in active discussions with our Chinese customers on their fleet planning needs and continue to urge leaders in both countries to resolve trade differences.\u201d The longer the current grounding drags on, the more Boeing is at serious risk of losing out on the Chinese market, analysts say. Typically, an airline is reluctant to switch between aircraft manufacturers because such a pivotal change increases the cost of pilot training and makes spare parts more costly. If Chinese customers with Boeing planes in their fleets were to start buying jets from rival Airbus\n            \n                (EADSF), it would be a long-term shift not easily reversed, and one made by the Chinese government rather than the airlines. \u201cBoeing has its fans over there. But a political mandate in China is a political mandate,\u201d Aboulafia said. He and other experts expect Boeing will eventually get back some sales and deliveries in China, but at a much lower number than it was counting on just a few years ago. China \u201ccan get some planes they need from Airbus, but they can\u2019t get all their planes from Airbus,\u201d said Ronald Epstein, aerospace analyst with Bank of America. Aboulafia describes the relationship between China and Boeing as a \u201cbad marriage with no possibility of divorce.\u201d  The only good news for Boeing is China\u2019s aviation sector is not as important as it appeared it would be a decade ago, when experts were projecting the market would account for 30% of all global commercial jet purchases. China\u2019s aviation industry was slowing even before the pandemic, Aboulafia said, from a 12.2% growth rate in 2018\u2019s fourth quarter to 5.3% a year later, just before the outbreak of Covid came to light.  If Boeing loses much of the Chinese market long-term, it will be relegated to being a permanent No. 2 behind Airbus. Global commercial jet sales are essentially a duopoly between the two companies. Being a permanent No. 2 would put Boeing at a long-term competitive disadvantage, Epstein said.",

For days, rescue teams had been combing through the crash site \u2013 wading through heavy mud and thicket, scattered with debris and plane parts \u2013 in southern China\u2019s Guangxi region, while desperate family members waited for news of their loved ones.  China\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC) said they have identified 120 of the victims using DNA testing, including 114 passengers and six crew members.  Monday\u2019s crash of the Boeing 737-800 plane marks China\u2019s worst air disaster in more than a decade. Flight MU5735 was en route from the southwestern city of Kunming to Guangzhou with 123 passengers and nine crew members on board, when it lost contact over the city of Wuzhou, the CAAC said in a statement. The cause of the crash has not yet been determined but on Sunday recovery teams found the plane\u2019s second so-called \u201cblack box,\u201d according to state media outlet Xinhua. State television channel CGTN also showed images of what it too reported was the black box. The recovery of the flight data recorder, along with the cockpit voice recorder discovered on Wednesday and sent to Beijing for analysis, should provide crucial clues to how the disaster unfolded.   Zhu Tao, director of the CAAC\u2019s Aviation Safety Office, said at a press conference Saturday that teams found an emergency locator transmitter, which is usually installed close to the second black box. An airline representative said on Tuesday, the plane was \u201cflying normally\u201d before it suddenly began dropping and lost contact with ground control, just over an hour into the flight. Pre-flight examinations showed nothing amiss, and all crew members were healthy and qualified, he added. An investigation by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) is ongoing, with the US National Transportation Safety Board and the US Federal Aviation Administration also involved. But it could take months, or even more than a year, before families receive any answers \u2013 the final report for the fatal 2010 Henan Airlines crash wasn\u2019t released until almost two years later. Air crash investigators warned on Tuesday that their probe into the cause of the crash will be \u201cvery difficult\u201d due to how severely damaged the plane is. China Eastern Airlines and its subsidiaries temporarily grounded 223 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, airline spokesperson Liu Xiaodong said on Thursday.  The grounded aircraft are undergoing safety inspection and maintenance to ensure that they are safe to fly, he said. The airline also launched a sweeping safety overhaul after the crash, he added.  The 737-800 is the most common version of Boeing\u2019s jets now in service, and it is the workhorse of many airlines\u2019 fleets. There are 4,502 of the 737-800s now in service worldwide, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium, making it by far the most common Boeing (BA) aircraft in use today.",

The Dow Jones Transportation Average\n            \n                (DJT), a group of 20 stocks that includes major railroads, truckers, airlines and freight companies, is up about 7% this month and is flat for the year.  Meanwhile, the more widely-known Dow Jones Industrial Average, which includes blue chips like Apple\n            \n                (AAPL), Coca-Cola\n            \n                (KO) and Disney\n            \n                (DIS), is down 5% in 2022, as investors grow nervous about rising interest rates and inflation.  When the Dow transports outperform the rest of the market, that is often viewed as a positive macroeconomic indicator.  It means consumers are buying lots of stuff from Amazon and Walmart that needs to be shipped to warehouses and retailers. And it\u2019s a sign that people are traveling again, for both leisure and business.  Rental car firm Avis Budget\n            \n                (CAR), railroad Union Pacific\n            \n                (UNP), trucking company JB Hunt\n            \n                (JBHT) and the airlines Alaska Air\n            \n                (ALK), Southwest\n            \n                (LUV) and JetBlue\n            \n                (JBLU) are among the top transportation stock performers this year.  The strength in transportation stocks is even more remarkable given the surge in energy prices. Oil has soared more than 50%, to around $115 a barrel in the United States.  Potential problems remain for the sector, of course. They include supply chain woes, trucker labor shortages and the resulting need to raise wages and a recent surge in Covid cases. Economic headwinds but consumers still traveling and shopping But many transportation firms have been able to withstand these pressures, as the economy\u2019s broad rebound in 2021 has offset much of the industry\u2019s challenges.  \u201cDemand for travel continues to move in the right direction,\u201d said Andrew Harrison, chief revenue officer and chief commercial officer for Alaska Airlines, on the company\u2019s January earnings call. \u201cSpring and summer travel should be strong on the leisure side, and benefit from the further unlocking of business and international travel,\u201d Harrison added. Americans also are buying more of everything, which is great news for railroads, truckers and other shipping firms. \u201cConsumers are flush\u2026they\u2019re financially healthy. So as long as their confidence isn\u2019t rattled, they seem to be postured to continue to purchase through the year,\u201d said Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz on the company\u2019s earnings call with analysts in January.  \u201cA lot of my industrial peers feel pretty confident that their marketplaces look pretty good to them,\u201d Fritz added, saying that executives in the housing and construction markets remained upbeat about the 2022 outlook. Trucking company JB Hunt is optimistic too, despite the difficulty in finding drivers. \u201cFor our customers overall? I would say demand is very strong across all of our services,\u201d said chief commercial officer Shelley Simpson during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call in January. Supply chain challenges aren\u2019t hurting shippers too much, either. \u201cConsumption trends remain elevated and retail and e-commerce demand remains strong,\u201d said Matthew Cox, CEO of ocean freight and logistics company Matson, during a February earnings call with analysts.  Matson\n            \n                (MATX) shares have soared 33% this year, making it one of the top performers in the Dow Jones Transportation Average. Still, not all transportation companies are benefiting from the upswing. Shares of FedEx\n            \n                (FDX) have fallen nearly 15% this year, making it one of the worst performers in the DJT.

            "text": "Jeff Bezos\u2019 space company, Blue Origin, said it will replace Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson with a long-time employee on the company\u2019s next supersonic jaunt to the edge of space. The company announced Monday it will replace Davidson with its chief architect of its suborbital rocket, Gary Lai. Davidson, who has become a pillar of entertainment intrigue amid his relationship with Kim Kardashian and feud with Kanye West, had been slated to fly as an invited guest alongside five paying customers aboard Blue Origin\u2019s New Shepard rocket. But when Blue Origin announced last week that it had to delay that flight \u2014 from March 23 to March 29 \u2014 for additional ground tests on the rocket, the company also announced Davidson could no longer join the mission.  Lai, who has been with Blue origin for 18 years and holds several patents related to the New Shepard rocket\u2019s design, will fly alongside five previously announced paying customers. They include Marty Allen, an investor and the former CEO of a party supply store; Jim Kitchen, an entrepreneur and business professor; George Nield, a former associate administrator for the Federal Aviation Administration Office of Commercial Space Transportation; Marc Hagle, an Orlando real estate developer and his wife, Sharon Hagle, who founded a space-focused nonprofit. After years of quiet development, Blue Origin\u2019s space tourism rocket made its crewed launch debut last year with Bezos, flying alongside a heroine of the space community, Wally Funk, as well as his brother Mark Bezos and a paying customer.  Since then, Blue Origin has been making headlines for flying other well-known names on two subsequent flights, including Star Trek star William Shatner and Good Morning America host Michael Strahan.  Blue Origin\u2019s goal is to make these suborbital spaceflights a mainstay of pop culture, giving a 10-minute supersonic joyride to invited guests \u2014 which thus far have mostly been celebrities \u2014 and anyone else who can afford it. The crew change-up with Lai and Davidson isn\u2019t the first. Last year, the company held an auction for one ticket to fly alongside Bezos, and the as-yet-unnamed winner of that auction agreed to shell out a staggering $28 million for the seat. But then the winner opted out, choosing to fly on a later mission, and a runner-up in the auction, a Dutch investor, passed the ticket on to his 18-year-old son, Oliver Daemen.  Before this month\u2019s flight, the Blue Origin passengers will spend a few days training at Blue Origin\u2019s facilities in West Texas before the flight day, when they\u2019ll climb into the New Shepard crew capsule that sits atop the rocket. After liftoff, the rocket will tear past the speed of sound, and near the top of its flight path, will detach from the capsule. As the rocket booster heads back toward the Earth for an upright landing, the crewed capsule will continue soaring higher into the atmosphere to more than 60 miles above the surface where the blackness of space is visible and the capsule\u2019s windows will offer sweeping views of the Earth. As the flight reaches its apex, the passengers will experience a few minutes of weightlessness. Bezos notably spent his time in weightlessness throwing Skittles and flipping around in the cabin. Others have been glued to the window. As gravity begins to pull the capsule back toward the ground, the passengers will again experience intense G-forces before sets of parachutes are deployed to slow the vehicle down. It will then touch down at less than 20 miles per hour in the Texas desert.

The 60-year-old, who moonlights as an electronic dance DJ when he\u2019s not running one of the largest investment banks in the world, has brought in record-breaking profits at Goldman while spinning records. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) confirmed that Solomon, who regularly DJs at clubs in Miami and New York under the alias \u201cD-sol\u201d will hit the stage at Lollapalooza, which hosted about 400,000 attendees in 2019. \u201c[I] kind of stumbled into it as a hobby, and now I just do it for fun,\u201d Solomon said on a Goldman Sachs podcast in 2017. Solomon typically DJs four to six events each year, and all profits go to charity, said the Goldman spokesperson. Some executives play golf for fun, added the spokesperson, Solomon DJs. Solomon\u2019s hobby has led him to headline a number of high-profile events, such as an Amazon event in 2019 and a Sports Illustrated Super Bowl party this year.  It has also stirred up controversy. He opened for The Chainsmokers at a crowded Hamptons charity event in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic in July 2020. The show prompted an investigation by the New York State Department of Health for what then-governor Andrew Cuomo called \u201cegregious social distancing violations.\u201d \u201cThe vast majority of the audience appeared to follow the rules, but [Solomon is] troubled that some violated them and put themselves and others at risk,\u201d a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said in a statement at the time. Last June Solomon transitioned from using DJ alias D-sol to his CEO name, David Solomon, and released a single entitled \u201cLearn to Love Me,\u201d which he promoted on his Instagram account. Lollapalooza will be held July 28 to 31 in Chicago\u2019s Grant Park, with more than 170 performances slated for eight stages. Four-day tickets for the event range from $350 to $4,200. ",

            "text": "Tesla opened its third assembly plant near Berlin, Germany, and made the first deliveries of its Model Y sedan there Tuesday.  The world\u2019s most valuable automaker will reportedly produce as many as 500,000 vehicles a year at the plant and plans to hire as many as 12,000 workers. The capacity is similar to its existing plants in California and Shanghai. Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) is building a factory in Austin, Texas, that will open soon.  The added capacity should fuel Tesla\u2019s anticipated growth. The automaker sold 936,000 vehicles in 2021, nearly double the 499,550 it sold in 2020. Electric vehicles are 10% of motor vehicle sales in Europe, and they outsold diesel cars for the first time in Western Europe in December 2021. Volkswagen has 24% of Europe\u2019s electric vehicle market, and Tesla trails with 13%, according to LMC Automotive. VW sold 452,900 electric vehicles worldwide in 2021, about half of Tesla\u2019s production, but it sold a total of 8.9 million vehicles overall.   Tesla sales have grown dramatically despite the chip shortage, which has hampered automakers. It reported a record profit in 2021. CEO Elon Musk danced and spoke at the event, calling the factory another step toward a sustainable energy future.  \u201cTesla will make sure that this is a gemstone for the area, for Germany, for Europe and for the world,\u201d Musk said. \u201cYou should have hope in the future. This [climate] problem will be solved and this factory is a major step in that direction. So believe in the future.\u201d German chancellor Olaf Scholz attended and spoke at the event. He described the factory on Twitter as a way to become carbon neutral. Tesla originally announced the factory in 2019. It has said that in 2022 it is focused on ramping up production and increasing output at its existing factories.  However, it won\u2019t be delivering the long-awaited Cybertruck, Roadster or Semi this year. The automaker\u2019s stock is down 21% this year as inflation, the ongoing pandemic, rising interest rates, and the war in Ukraine have impacted the markets. Anna Cooban contributed to this report.",

            "text": "Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster is calling on Congress to swiftly fund investments in American computer chip manufacturing, a plan championed by the Biden administration to address global semiconductor shortages. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely critical,\u201d McMaster, a retired Army lieutenant general, told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cIf China has a lock on supply chains relating to economic prosperity or our security, that\u2019s a really bad thing.\u201d McMaster participated in a bipartisan Commerce Department event Monday where national security officials urged lawmakers to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act, which would invest $52 billion in domestic semiconductor production and advanced manufacturing. The event included former Trump officials Matthew Pottinger and Bonnie Glick, and highlighted how members of both administrations have found agreement in the need to compete aggressively with China. \u201cSupply chains that have been biased in favor almost exclusively of efficiency and low-cost have to be shifted in favor of resilience,\u201d McMaster said in the interview.  An epic shortage of computer chips has helped drive up the cost of consumer electronics and caused record price spikes on new and used cars. High car prices are contributing to the worst inflation in 40 years.  Just 12% of the world\u2019s computer chips are made in the United States today, compared with 40% in 1990, according to the Commerce Department. Almost all \u2013 90% \u2013 of the most sophisticated chips are made outside the United States.  The computer chip shortage is so severe that Ford recently announced it will start shipping Explorers without all the parts. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine threatens to pile further pressure on the semiconductor supply chain. Ukraine is a major source of neon, a key ingredient for making computer chips. Earlier this month, two leading suppliers of neon in Ukraine halted their operations amid the war there.  Even before Russia invaded Ukraine, a Commerce Department report warned that some manufacturers that rely on semiconductors had less than five days\u2019 worth of inventory.  Confronting China McMaster, now a senior fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, worries the war in Ukraine will give Beijing another opening to make the United States and the West more dependent on China for critical goods \u2013 this time, through semiconductors. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo shares some of those concerns. \u201cOur competitors like China are racing to support their semiconductor industries and they aren\u2019t waiting for us to catch up,\u201d Raimondo said at the Commerce event. \u201cEvery day we wait is a day we fall further behind.\u201d China has made it part of its long-term plans to invest in boosting semiconductor capabilities, making it less dependent on providers abroad.  McMaster called on Republicans and Democrats to set aside their differences to invest in US semiconductors.  \u201cStop compromising important national security interests to score partisan political points,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is one area of bipartisan agreement, it\u2019s on the threat from China\u2019s communist party. There is a heck of a lot more continuity than change in the Trump and Biden administrations there.\u201d",

            "text": "No survivors of a China Eastern Airlines plane crash have been found after a second day of search efforts, Chinese investigators said late Tuesday. In China\u2019s worst air disaster in more than a decade, the Boeing 737-800 \u2013 carrying 132 people \u2013 crashed Monday afternoon in a remote, mountainous region in the south of the country as it flew from Kunming to Guangzhou. Communications with the crew could not be established in the final moments before the airliner crashed, Chinese air crash investigators said at a Tuesday news conference. \u201cThe flight took off from Kunming at 1:16 p.m. and was flying normally. At around 2:21 p.m., it arrived over Wuzhou city of Guangxi province. The ground station noticed that the plane had a sudden altitude change, and then it lost communication with the plane, before the plane eventually crashed,\u201d said Sun Shiying, a representative for China Eastern Airlines.  The aircraft had passed pre-flight checks and the nine crew members were qualified and healthy, added Sun. The cause of the crash is not yet clear, an official from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said. \u201cThe investigation team will spare no effort to collect evidence from all parties and focus on search,\u201d said the CAAC official. Investigators still haven\u2019t located the plane\u2019s black boxes, state broadcaster CCTV reported Tuesday, and are facing difficult terrain and poor weather.  The black boxes are flight data and cockpit voice recorders which could hold crucial clues to how the disaster unfolded. The probe into the cause of the crash will be \u201cvery difficult,\u201d warned investigators, due to how severely damaged the plane is. Photos and videos posted by state media show giant plumes of smoke rising above the mountains following the crash. Search and rescue crews wade through the thicket, scattered with debris and plane parts. Wallets, ID cards and fragments of a phone were among personal belongings strewn on the ground, China Youth Daily reported. In the minutes before the disaster, the plane had been at a cruising altitude of 29,000 feet (about 8,900 meters), according to flight tracking data from FlightRadar24. Then, the jet nosedived so quickly that it plunged more than 25,000 feet (7,600 meters) in under two minutes. Security footage from a mining company near the crash site shows what appears to be a plane hurtling toward the forest, nearly vertical in its rapid fall. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the video, or that the aircraft is China Eastern Flight 5735 \u2013 but the steep decline matches the flight tracking data. Witnesses reported seeing a fiery explosion, airplane parts and clothing tangled in the trees, and swathes of the woods aflame.  One item retrieved from the crash site, a handwritten note describing the significance of traditional jade jewelry, was photographed and spread widely online. The jewelry signifies \u201ca complete life, a smooth career, family happiness, inner peace \u2026 which outlines people\u2019s expectations of life,\u201d the note read \u2013 prompting messages of mourning on Chinese social media.  On Monday evening, relatives of the passengers gathered in the Guangzhou airport, waiting for any news of their loved ones as authorities launched an investigation into the crash. Due to the apparent speed of the crash, there is little chance anyone on board survived or that there will be clear remains left to identify, said David Soucie, a former safety inspector at the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Investigation and search operation Chinese President Xi Jinping issued a rare statement within hours of the crash, ordering the country\u2019s emergency services to organize a search and rescue operation, and to identify the cause of the crash. \u201cThe fact that the President made such a pronounced and quick response to this tells me that they\u2019re taking it very, very seriously,\u201d Soucie said.  After several plane crashes in the 1990s and 2000s, China made a series of sweeping safety improvements. Monday\u2019s disaster is the country\u2019s first deadly commercial air crash since the 2010 Henan Airlines disaster, which killed 44 of the 96 people on board. Hundreds of rescuers were deployed to the China Eastern crash site on Monday, and continued their work through the night. Footage showed police and emergency workers making their way through mountain paths in the dark, wielding flashlights. Other teams, including medical staff and firefighters, are seen working under tents, preparing supplies and surveillance drones.  But they face numerous challenges. The crash site is flanked by mountains on three sides, with only one narrow path in and no electricity in the area, according to state media. Heavy rescue equipment was unable to reach the scene on Monday, with videos showing search teams scrambling uphill through the trees.  A cold front is also expected to arrive soon, which could see heavy rainfall in the coming days, according to the Guangxi Meteorological Bureau.  It\u2019s not yet clear what caused the plane to begin dropping \u2013 and we won\u2019t know more until authorities can retrieve and analyze the plane\u2019s cockpit voice recorder, black box and other essential pieces of data, said Soucie, the former FAA inspector. Aviation expert Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), told CNN that it might not be possible to do so. \u201cThe biggest thing they can do right now is try and recover the flight data recorder and the voice recorder but with that kind of impact, those recorders could be damaged,\u201d said Goelz. The investigation will be led by the CAAC. Boeing, the engine manufacturer, CFM, and the FAA will also be involved in the probe. Investigators taking part in Tuesday\u2019s press conference did not comment on whether representatives from the NTSB would take part in the investigation. This arrangement is standard for aviation incidents involving a US-designed aircraft that occur overseas. Piecing together all the information and evidence in an investigation into the crash of a modern jetliner could take months or longer. The final report for the 2010 Henan Airlines crash wasn\u2019t released until almost two years later. Meanwhile, China Eastern Airlines is contacting all families of the victims, according to CCTV. Wuzhou authorities have sent dozens of buses and taxis to pick up family members. \u201cThat\u2019s the most difficult part about being an accident investigator, is dealing with the families,\u201d Soucie said. \u201cWhat the families want at this point is to obtain whatever remains they can from the victims of the accident. In this case, there won\u2019t be much for them to get.\u201d Boeing troubles Though Boeing\u2019s 737 has faced extraordinarily high-profile safety concerns over the past three years, the plane that crashed Monday was a different version of the aircraft than the embattled 737 Max, crashes of which shook Boeing to its core.  The China Eastern Airlines plane was a Boeing 737-800, the most popular version of Boeing\u2019s jets now in service and the workhorse of many airlines\u2019 fleets. The plane that crashed Monday had been in service since 2015.  The airline will ground all its Boeing 737-800 flights, CCTV reported. But other Chinese carriers will continue to operate the same aircraft type, according to state media. The 737-800 is part of a class of Boeing jets known as 737-NG, standing for \u201cNext Generation.\u201d These planes have had safety issues cited by US regulators, although none of those rose to the level of requiring the planes to be grounded. Boeing has sold more than 7,000 737-NG airliners worldwide and, until Monday, the type had seen only a dozen fatal accidents in its 25-year history. Boeing came under international scrutiny after its 737 Max, which succeeded the 737-800, suffered two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. Those crashes were shown to be caused by a flaw in the design of a new stabilization system, which the 737-800 does not have.",

            "text": "Alibaba has a message for investors nervous about its slowing growth and geopolitical uncertainty: We think our stock is cheap and we\u2019re putting our money where our mouth is. Shares of Alibaba rose more than 11% Tuesday after the Chinese e-commerce and cloud giant announced it was \n            \n                boosting the size of its share buyback program from $15 billion to $25 billion.  Stocks typically go up on buyback news because repurchases lower the total number of shares outstanding, which boosts earnings per share. Investors also like to see companies invest in their own stock because it can send the signal that management believes the stock is a bargain. Alibaba said as much in a press release. \u201cThe upsized share buyback underscores our confidence in Alibaba\u2019s long-term, sustainable growth potential and value creation. Alibaba\u2019s stock price does not fairly reflect the company\u2019s value given our robust financial health and expansion plans,\u201d said the company\u2019s deputy chief financial officer, Toby Xu.  This is the second time in the past year that Alibaba has increased the pace of its stock purchases. The company raised its buyback target from $10 billion to $15 billion in August. Alibaba has plenty of cash on hand to buy shares, having ended December with more than $75 billion on its balance sheet. Alibaba shares have surged 50% over the past five days. Investors are hoping that recent signs from Chinese president Xi Jinping about a loosening of restrictions on Chinese tech companies in an attempt to lift the country\u2019s stock market and economy will improve sentiment. But the stock is still down more than 3% this year and about 50% over the past 12 months. Shares of Alibaba, along with rival JD\n            \n                (JD) and other top Chinese firms Tencent\n            \n                (TCEHY), Baidu\n            \n                (BIDU) and Nio\n            \n                (NIO), have been incredibly volatile due to concerns about a resurgence of Covid in China and fears that it could be delisted in the United States as regulators look to crack down on Chinese companies. Another prominent investor is also extremely bullish on Alibaba. Charlie Munger, the 98-year old vice chairman of Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKB), has been buying more Alibaba shares for his own company.  Munger\u2019s Daily Journal\n            \n                (DJCO), a newspaper publisher and investing firm, boosted its stake in Alibaba earlier this year.  Speaking at the Daily Journal annual shareholder meeting last month, Munger did not specifically comment on Alibaba but said that he sees more value in China than in the US stock market. He praised the Chinese government for taking more steps to modernize its economy. ",

            "text": "In November last year, one of India\u2019s most prominent tech entrepreneurs stood at the Bombay Stock Exchange and cried with joy.   I am \u201cjust overwhelmed,\u201d said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, while wiping tears from his eyes. He was addressing an audience at the listing ceremony of One97 Communications, the parent company of digital payments giant Paytm.  Sharma founded the company nearly two decades ago. In the last five years, Paytm has become the darling of India\u2019s booming fintech sector, and is backed by big-name global investors such as SoftBank\n            \n                (SFTBF) and Warren Buffett. In 2021, One97 raised $2.5 billion in the country\u2019s biggest ever initial public offering (IPO).  During November\u2019s listing ceremony, Sharma called the company\u2019s purpose of bringing millions of Indians into the mainstream economy \u201cpious.\u201d  Investors, however, appear to disagree \u2014 Paytm\u2019s stock crashed 27% on its first day of trading. Four months later, things have only gotten worse. The firm\u2019s stock is now trading close to 560 rupees ($8), more than 70% below its offer price, according to data from Refinitiv.  It is not the only Indian internet company that has soured on the stock market this year. While Paytm has been a flop since day one, other Indian tech giants whose debuts were red-hot in comparison have also plunged in recent months. Food delivery company Zomato \u2014 the first Indian unicorn to go public \u2014 is down over 36% from its first day of trading last July.  E-commerce site Nykaa, whose debut late last year made its founder India\u2019s wealthiest self-made female billionaire, is also trading 36% below the highs it saw on listing day. Online insurance marketplace Policybazaar has fallen more than 40% since it began trading in November.  While technology stocks are suffering globally, the plunge in India is particularly painful for investors and companies who were hoping for a coming-of-age period for one of Asia\u2019s fastest-growing startup ecosystems.  Instead, it has turned into a big, fat reality check for tech companies, with retail investors questioning their huge valuations. The steep plunge in those stocks has also likely thwarted IPO plans for other Indian companies \u2014 at least for the foreseeable future. \u201cLast year, there was an IPO frenzy and people were willing to pay the aggressive valuations these companies demanded,\u201d said Piyush Nagda, head of investment products at Mumbai-based brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher. \u201cBut those retail investors were looking for immediate listing day gains.\u201d \u201cOther investors who got on the bus after the IPO may be repenting now,\u201d he added. Paytm\u2019s flop  India\u2019s tech IPO party \u2014 which started with Zomato last year \u2014 came to a screeching halt with Paytm\u2019s debut.  While the stock has trended lower for most part since its listing, March has been particularly difficult for the payments company.  Earlier this month, India\u2019s central bank barred the company\u2019s banking arm from signing up new customers. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also directed the bank to \u201cappoint an IT audit firm to conduct a comprehensive System Audit of its IT system.\u201d Paytm launched its Payments Bank in 2017 as a joint venture with Sharma. It can accept deposits and issue debit cards but cannot lend money to customers. The RBI said it would allow Paytm\u2019s Payments Bank to add new customers \u201cafter reviewing [the] report of the IT auditors.\u201d Paytm stock plunged further after the RBI\u2019s notice, even though the company tried to reassure existing customers by informing them that they can continue using that bank\u2019s services \u201cwithout interruption.\u201d   \u201cWe believe RBI\u2019s direction will not materially impact Paytm\u2019s overall business,\u201d a company spokesperson said in a statement.  But the damage had been done. To complicate matters further, China\u2019s Ant Group and Alibaba\n            \n                (BABA) own more than 30% of Paytm, according to recent filings, and that investment has become problematic since border clashes in 2020 soured relations between India and China and led New Delhi to ban dozens of Chinese apps.  In a note last week, Macquarie analysts predicted a bleak future for the company.  The RBI ban and Paytm\u2019s \u201cChinese ownership\u201d make it \u201csignificantly\u201d harder for the bank now to get a license from the regulators to upgrade and start lending, they wrote. \u201cGiven this, and competition from other fintechs in the payments space, we remain skeptical about Paytm\u2019s longer-term ability to generate free cash flow,\u201d they added, slashing Paytm\u2019s target price to Rs 450 ($6). All this bad news for Paytm comes on top of its lack of clear path to profitability, which has perturbed analysts since its IPO launch. Paytm reported a loss of $104 million for the December quarter. And it is not just Paytm that has failed to impress investors with latest earnings.  Zomato \u2014 which remains a loss-making company \u2014 had scored big with its IPO in July last year, but its stock has fizzled lately, declining over 40% alone since the start of this year. The company said Tuesday that it will start a 10-minute food delivery service, but the stock remained near its all-time low even after that announcement.  \u201cVenture capitalists have the stomach to digest these numbers,\u201d said Nagda, while talking about lack of profits among Indian tech giants. \u201cBut retail investors react immediately once they see quarterly numbers.\u201d Zomato has also disappointed investors with its relative lack of transparency, as it holds only one earnings call a year. Most public companies do four calls a year, usually after every quarterly result.  Zomato did not respond to a request for comment.  Mihir Vora, senior director and chief investment officer at Max Life Insurance called this moment a \u201creality check\u201d for India\u2019s cash-guzzling tech firms, which need to participate in more \u201cregular investor communications.\u201d \u201cThe cash burn is too large,\u201d he said. Markets want to know \u201cwhere the next round of funding is coming from.\u201d What\u2019s next? Paytm\u2019s nosedive, followed by the battering other tech stocks have received in India lately, may be forcing other companies to reconsider their IPO plans.  In October last year, Softbank-backed hotel chain OYO confirmed plans to raise nearly $1 billion through its debut. But, according to a recent Bloomberg report, the company is now considering \u201cslashing its fundraising target by half or even shelving the debut.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s considering also halving its expected valuation from the $12 billion originally targeted,\u201d Bloomberg added, citing unnamed sources.  In an email to CNN Business, OYO \u201cstrongly\u201d denied the assertions made in the report. \u201cOYO continues to receive investor interest as we await approval from the regulator,\u201d it added, but declined to disclose any specific details.  Paytm\u2019s smaller rival Mobikwik has said it would defer its IPO, originally planned for November last year, by a few months. The company told CNN Business last year it would \u201clist at the right time,\u201d without sharing any other details.  Despite the current turmoil, most global investors say that India remains attractive for them, provided companies coming to market are more realistic about their valuations.  \u201cThere is no emerging market that offers the growth opportunities that India does,\u201d said Nuno Fernandes, portfolio manager of the emerging wealth strategy at GW&K Investment Management. But he also said that he found most valuations by Indian tech giants last year \u201ccompletely unwarranted\u201d and hopes other startups would be more cautious now.  \u201cMy recommendation to the management is that it is better to be modest and be successful in the IPO, rather than have it falter.\u201d",

            "text": "A Boeing 737 carrying 132 people crashed early Monday in China. Although Boeing\u2019s 737 has faced extraordinarily high-profile safety concerns over the past three years, the plane that crashed Monday was a different version of the aircraft than the embattled 737 Max that shook Boeing to its core. The cause of Monday\u2019s crash has yet to be determined. The plane had been in service since 2015. The flight, operated by China Eastern Airlines, was flying from the southwestern Chinese city of Kunming to Guangzhou when it crashed. Here\u2019s what we know about the aircraft. The 737-800 The crashed China Eastern Airlines plane was a Boeing 737-800. It\u2019s the most common version of Boeing\u2019s jets now in service, and it is the workhorse of many airlines\u2019 fleets.  There are 4,502 of the 737-800s now in service worldwide, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium, making it by far the most common Boeing\n            \n                (BA) aircraft in use today. It is the most common plane model in the United States, where there are 795 in service, as well as in China, which has 1,177 in service. And it\u2019s the second-most-common plane in use worldwide, behind only the A320 made by Boeing\n            \n                (BA) rival Airbus\n            \n                (EADSF).  The 737-800 is an older model aircraft that has been replaced by the 737 Max.  Previous safety issues Boeing started deliveries of the 737-800 in 1998 but has not delivered a civilian version of the plane since two went to China Eastern in January 2020.  The Boeing 737-800 is part of a class of Boeing jets known as 737-NG. The \u201cNext Generation\u201d planes have had safety issues cited by US regulators, although none of those rose to the level of requiring the planes to be grounded. In 2018 a single passenger was killed on a Boeing 737-700, the other plane in the Next Generation family. In that accident, an engine fan blade on a Southwest Airlines flight broke and caused part of the engine covering to hit the side of the plane. It smashed one of the windows, and the cabin rapidly depressurized. The crew was able to land the plane safely, but a woman sitting next to that window was killed.  In 2019 the National Transportation Safety Board recommended that Boeing redesign part of the jet\u2019s engine covers to prevent them from flying into the plane in the event of a similar malfunction. Boeing agreed to make the change. In some older planes, a part used to keep the wings in place was found to have cracks. Those cracks temporarily grounded a handful of the 737 NGs. Other fatal accidents involving the 737-800 have occurred when planes were landing in bad weather and missed or skidded off runways. Another one was shot out of the sky by a missile in Iran in 2020. There has not been a fatal accident with a Chinese airline since 2010, according to the Aviation Safety Network. Boeing issued a statement Monday saying it is working with both US and Chinese safety authorities. \u201cOur thoughts are with the passengers and crew of China Eastern Airlines Flight 5735,\u201d the plane maker said. \u201cWe are working with our airline customer and are ready to support them. Boeing is in contact with the US National Transportation Safety Board and our technical experts are prepared to assist with the investigation led by the Civil Aviation Administration of China.\u201d The 737 Max Boeing\u2019s 737 Max suffered two fatal crashes, in 2018 and 2019, that were shown to be caused by a design flaw and led to a global grounding of the aircraft.  Those crashes resulted in the 20-month grounding of the 737 Max, costing Boeing tens of billions of dollars. The 737-800 does not have the feature that caused the 737 Max crashes. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Richard Quest, Yong Xiong and Helen Regan contributed to this report.",

            "text": "A China Eastern Airlines jetliner carrying 132 people crashed in the mountains in southern China\u2019s Guangxi region on Monday afternoon, according to the country\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC). The Boeing 737 was en route from the southwestern city of Kunming to Guangzhou when it lost contact over the city of Wuzhou. On board were 123 passengers and nine crew members, CAAC said in a statement posted online.  China Eastern Airlines confirmed those details and said it had activated emergency procedures, including a line for emergency assistance for family members. Rescue efforts are underway at the scene of the crash, but there were no immediate details on the possible cause or the number of casualties.  China Eastern offered its condolences to those who were killed in the incident, without confirming any death toll. \u201cThe cause of the plane crash is still under investigation. The company expresses its sorrowful condolences to the passengers and crew members who died in this plane crash,\u201d the airline said in a statement.   Boeing said in a statement: \u201cOur thoughts are with the passengers and crew of China Eastern Airlines Flight MU 5735. We are working with our airline customer and are ready to support them.\u201d  The company added that it is in contact with the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and that its technical experts are ready to assist in the CAAC investigation. Later Monday, the NTSB said it \u201cappointed a senior air safety investigator as a U.S. accredited representative to the investigation,\u201d which will be led by the CAAC. Boeing, engine manufacturer CFM, and the US Federal Aviation Administration will also be involved in the probe, the NTSB said. This arrangement is standard for aviation incidents involving a US-designed Boeing aircraft that occur in other countries.       Chinese President Xi Jinping instructed the country\u2019s emergency services to \u201corganize a search and rescue\u201d operation and \u201cidentify the causes of the accident,\u201d state media reported.  \u201cAfter the accident, President Xi Jinping immediately made instructions to start the emergency mechanism, organize search and rescue, and properly deal with the aftermath,\u201d state broadcaster CCTV said.  Sudden descent The aircraft lost contact with emergency services before \u201csuddenly descending\u201d around 2:19 p.m., Chinese government officials and state media reported Monday.  \u201cA China Eastern plane (flight number MU5735) lost contact at 2.15 pm \u2026 Rescue teams are on the way to ground zero, and rescue work is being laid out in order,\u201d the Guangxi Emergency Management Department said in a statement.  The plane\u2019s altitude dropped from 8,869 meters (29,098 feet) to 1,333.5 meters (4,375 feet) in the span of three minutes, state news agency China News Service reported, citing VariFlight, a Chinese technology company that provides civil aviation data services. Hours after the accident, CCTV reported that the airline was grounding all its Boeing 737-800s and that the aircraft currently in the air would \u201cnot carry more flights after landing.\u201d CCTV also reported that rescue efforts could be hampered by bad weather and limited accessibility to the site.  Heavy rescue equipment was unable to reach the scene \u2013 which lacks electricity \u2013 as it is surrounded by mountains on three sides and accessible only through a narrow path, CCTV said, citing the Guangxi Wuzhou fire department.   Separately, Guangxi Meteorological Bureau warned that the rescue effort could be hindered by an incoming cold front that would see heavy rainfall and a temperature drop in Tengxian County, where the crash site is. Eyewitness describes falling plane In an interview with state media outlet Beijing Youth Daily, an eyewitness described seeing a plane \u201cfalling directly from the sky in front of him around 2 p.m.\u201d \u201cThe plane fell vertically from the sky. Although I was very far away, I could still see that it was a plane. The plane did not smoke during the fall. The fire started after it fell into the mountain, followed by a lot of smoke,\u201d the witness, who was only identified by his surname, Liu, said. \u201cMy heart was thumping. I immediately informed friends about the situation, that this area is dangerous and not to come nearby,\u201d Liu continued. In a separate interview with China News Service, a resident from Molang village in Tengxian county \u2013 close to the scene of the crash \u2013 reported seeing \u201cwings and pieces of the plane, as well as pieces of clothing hanging from trees.\u201d The witness \u2013 whose name was not published \u2013 told state media he drove his motorcycle to the crash site after hearing \u201ca huge explosion\u201d around 2:40 pm to \u201csee if he could participate in the rescue.\u201d The onlooker added that the accident caused \u201cabout 10 acres of fire,\u201d according to his visual estimates.  Video showing what appears to be a plane falling nose first from the sky circulated widely on Chinese social media Monday, before being picked up and published by state media.  Footage posted online and shared by state media outlet People\u2019s Daily show plumes of smoke billowing from a mountainous, forested area. Another clip shows what appears to be wreckage from the plane on a muddy mountain path.  The colors on the Boeing and China Eastern Airlines websites were changed to black and white in China, as a sign of respect in response to the crash.",

            "text": "SpaceX has a new deal to launch internet-beaming satellites for its chief competitor in the satellite business \u2014 British company OneWeb. The somewhat awkward pairing, announced by OneWeb on Monday, comes after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine effectively brought a halt to Russian launches of commercial Western satellites. A launch deal between OneWeb and Russia that was brokered through an intermediary fell through, with the Russian space agency essentially holding the company\u2019s satellites hostage, as they sat loaded on board a Russian Soyuz rocket at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The new deal puts SpaceX, the world\u2019s most prolific commercial launch provider, in the unique position of launching satellites that could compete with its own Starlink satellites in the space-based internet business. OneWeb is, however, currently marketing its services to businesses rather than directly to consumers, as SpaceX does with Starlink. OneWeb, which is partially owned by the British government, was set to launch a batch of 36 internet satellites in early March. But Dmitry Rogozin, Director General of Roscosmos and a former Deputy Prime Minister of Russia with a flair for inflammatory rhetoric, then announced Russia would refuse to go ahead with what should be a routine launch in response to UK sanctions on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.  The agency demanded that the UK government sell its stake in OneWeb, and that the company guarantee the satellites would not be used for military purposes, according to an ultimatum spelled out on Twitter from Roscosmos\u2019 offical account. Roscosmos stressed the demands are \u201cdue to the UK\u2019s hostile stance towards Russia\u201d on Wednesday.  \u201cThe Board of OneWeb has voted to suspend all launches from Baikonur,\u201d the UK firm said in a statement responding to Rogozin\u2019s tweets. Rogozin has tweeted flamboyant statements in the past in response to Western sanctions \u2014 namely in 2014 after the Russian annexation of Crimea. \u201cAfter analyzing the sanctions against our space industry, I suggest to the USA to bring their astronauts to the International Space Station using a trampoline,\u201d Rogozin said at the time on Twitter following US sanctions against Russia\u2019s space sector. Despite Rogozin\u2019s flamboyant tweets and interviews, the West and Russia have historically cooperated in space. Teams that work on the International Space Station, which counts the United States and Russia as its primary operators, are still working closely together behind the scenes, according to NASA, despite the increasingly confrontational rhetoric. The first SpaceX launch of OneWeb satellites is now slated for this year. OneWeb said in its announcement that its constellation of internet satellites stands at 428 satellites, or about 66% of the total that the company will need to provide continuous coverage to places on the ground. The company is working to attract customers and pay back investors after the UK government and India\u2019s Bharti Global saved it from bankruptcy in 2020.  SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. The Elon Musk-led company is still far ahead of its competitor in deploying its satellite internet constellation. Roughly 2,000 SpaceX Starlink satellites are already in orbit and it has customers all over the world. Earlier this month, SpaceX even delivered Starlink ground terminals to the Ukrainian government amid Russia\u2019s invasion, which could allow people in the country to remain online if Earth-based internet infrastructure in Ukraine is destroyed.",

            "text": "It may not be the \u201celephant-sized\u201d deal that Warren Buffett has long promised, but Berkshire Hathaway is making its biggest acquisition in years: it\u2019s buying insurer Alleghany for $11.6 billion in cash. Buffett, the \u201cOracle of Omaha,\u201d has been saying for years that he wants to make a huge purchase \u2014 but that companies were too expensive. As a result, Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKB) has nearly $147 billion in cash on its balance sheet. With Monday\u2019s announcement, however, Buffett clearly must have felt that buying Alleghany was a big deal. The acquisition expands Berkshire\u2019s already sizable portfolio of insurance companies, which includes Geico, General Re and several others. Shares of Alleghany\n            \n                (Y) soared about 25% on the news.  The Alleghany acquisition also brings back a former Buffett lieutenant. Its CEO Joseph Brandon, who led General Re from 2001 to 2008 and was once considered a possible Buffett successor. (Buffett announced last year that Berkshire vice chairman Greg Abel will eventually be CEO.) \u201cBerkshire will be the perfect permanent home for Alleghany, a company that I have closely observed for 60 years,\u201d Buffett said in a press release Monday. \u201cI am particularly delighted that I will once again work together with my long-time friend, Joe Brandon.\u201d Brandon wrote in a statement that \u201cthis is a terrific transaction for Alleghany\u2019s owners, businesses, customers, and employees\u201d and that \u201ceach of Alleghany\u2019s businesses will be exceptionally well positioned to serve its clients and achieve its full potential.\u201d Alleghany, like most Berkshire subsidiaries, will continue to operate independently. Still hunting an elephant Berkshire\u2019s last huge deal was the 2015 acquisition of aerospace equipment company Precision Castparts for more than $37 billion. But Buffett said in last year\u2019s annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter that he \u201cpaid too much for\u201d the company. He also wrote three years ago in Berkshire\u2019s shareholder letter that he and Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger are longing to do \u201can elephant-sized acquisition.\u201d  But Buffett lamented how expensive businesses are to buy. That\u2019s why Berkshire has mostly put cash to work during the past few years by investing in more quality blue-chip stocks, such as top holdings Apple\n            \n                (AAPL), Bank of America\n            \n                (BAC), American Express\n            \n                (AXP), Coca-Cola\n            \n                (KO) and Kraft Heinz\n            \n                (KHC). In Berkshire\u2019s most recent annual shareholder letter, Buffett continued to express frustration about the lack of good values. He wrote last month about possible acquisitions, saying that \u201cfrom time to time, such possibilities are both numerous and blatantly attractive. Today, though, we find little that excites us.\u201d Still, Berkshire has recently gone on an oil stock buying binge, adding aggressively to its position in Occidental Petroleum\n            \n                (OXY) over the past month. Shares of Berkshire\u2019s class B stock, which are more affordable for average investors, rose slightly Monday to about $345 a share.  The class A Berkshire shares\n            \n                (BRKA), which do not split to keep their price lower, trade at about $513,000 apiece. Both classes of Berkshire shares are up about 15% this year and are not far from their all-time highs. Berkshire owns a wide range of companies, from the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad and Duracell batteries to Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom. It\u2019s one of the most valuable companies on the planet, worth more than $750 billion. Buffett\u2019s personal net worth is just under $125 billion.",

Shares of Occidental Petroleum shot up about 7% Thursday, making them the best performer in the S&P 500. Occidental Petroleum\u2019s stock has now nearly doubled in 2022.  Berkshire\u2019s stock rose about 2% as well Thursday. Its shares have risen nearly 15% this year and are trading at a record high.  Berkshire, along with top energy stocks, has benefited from skyrocketing oil prices in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Crude prices are now up more than 35% this year and are above $100 a barrel. The Occidental investment adds to Berkshire\u2019s already significant position in the energy industry. Berkshire has a massive energy subsidiary that owns leading electric utilities such as PacifiCorp and MidAmerican, oil and natural gas pipelines and several renewable power companies.  Greg Abel, the Berkshire vice chairman who oversees Berkshire Energy and the company\u2019s other non-financial businesses, was tapped last year to eventually succeed Buffett as Berkshire CEO. Berkshire also has a stake in oil giant Chevron\n            \n                (CVX), which lost a bidding war to Occidental for Anadarko in 2019. ",

            "text": "Russia is seizing hundreds of commercial jets owned by US and European leasing companies, a further sign of the challenges the country\u2019s airline industry faces due to sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin signed a law Monday as part of the government\u2019s anti-sanction measures that will allow Russian airlines to register planes leased from foreign companies in Russia, where they will be issued local certificates of airworthiness, according to a statement from the Kremlin. The bill will make it possible for Russian airlines to keep their foreign leased aircraft and operate the planes on domestic routes, while making  it harder for foreign companies to reclaim their jets without Russian government approval. US and European sanctions imposed on Russia require leasing companies to repossess all planes they leased to Russian airlines by the end of the month. Western aircraft makers such as Airbus\n            \n                (EADSF) and Boeing\n            \n                (BA) have already cut off Russian airlines\u2019 access to the spare parts they need to maintain and safely fly their jets. Russian airlines operate 305 Airbus\n            \n                (EADSF) jets and 332 Boeing\n            \n                (BA) jets, according to data provided by aviation analytics firm Cirium. Russia also has 83 regional jets made by Western manufacturers such as Bombardier, Embraer and ATR. Only 144 planes in the active fleets of Russian airlines were built in Russia.  Cirium data shows that 85% of those foreign-made planes are owned by leasing companies, and puts their combined value at $12.4 billion. It was unclear how the leasing companies could have taken possession of these planes while they remain on Russian soil. Additional sanctions prohibiting Russian aircraft from flying to most other countries has restricted its airline industry essentially to domestic flights. Leasing companies have not responded to a request for comment on Russia\u2019s actions, and it is unclear if they\u2019ll even want those planes back.  The planes will not have access to replacement parts and won\u2019t have valid airworthiness certificates that would be accepted by western airlines.  \u201cThese jets won\u2019t be supported with parts and maintenance any longer,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory. \u201cIt\u2019s a real issue if they lose their certificates of airworthiness, which can happen if proper records aren\u2019t kept, or especially if they\u2019re cannibalized for parts.\u201d Losing access to 85% of its foreign-built planes would be a crippling blow to the country\u2019s economy. Russia is the world\u2019s largest nation by landmass, more than twice the size of the continental United States. It needs a viable airline industry to keep its economy working, said Charles Lichfield, the deputy director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council, an international think tank. \u201cIt is an important part of Russia\u2019s economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want some basic domestic industry to remain in place. Russians don\u2019t fly as much as Americans do. They don\u2019t fly to Siberia for vacation.\u201d  Its airline industry is a crucial link for businesses, not only for international flights but also for domestic service for its energy sector, due to the need to transport engineers, other workers and equipment to and from its far flung oil fields.  \u201cAviation is an incredible enabler of economic growth, both domestically and internationally,\u201d said Robert Mann, an airline consultant and analyst. \u201cWithout it, you take it back to an almost agrarian economy, trying to operate with a railroad network.\u201d Russia doesn\u2019t need all the planes it is seizing, as the blow to its economy from the sanctions will greatly reduce the need for air travel, said Betsy Snyder, credit analyst covering aircraft leasing companies at Standard & Poor\u2019s. \u201cThe Russian economy is tanking,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one will be going in and out of Russia, the Russian citizens are losing their money so they don\u2019t have the money to travel going forward. It could be that [airlines] will be a much smaller business.\u201d That raises the possibility that many of the planes being seized would be cannibalized for parts.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t have parts manufacturing authority, then you shouldn\u2019t be making it yourself,\u201d Mann said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what standards were used. Have you gotten the internal characteristic right? When you put it into a turbine section of an engine, will it perform like it was designed?\u201d  Mann said that when a part reaches the end of its designed usefulness, known as \u201cgreen time,\u201d an airline must choose between flying with parts that should have been replaced for safety reasons or robbing parts from other planes.  \u201cYou can go through that process as long as you have planes that have green time,\u201d he said. \u201d As you run out of airplanes, your network gets smaller and you can fly fewer hours every day, until you don\u2019t have an airline.\u201d  So even keeping the planes won\u2019t necessarily keep the Russian airline industry operating.\u201dWithin a year Russia will cease to have any kind of viable airline industry,\u201d Aboulafia said, adding that the  its airline industry could soon find itself somewhere between the heavily sanctioned industries in Iran and North Korea. Can a country as large as Russia live without a modern, viable airline industry? \u201cThat\u2019s a thesis that has never been put to the test,\u201d Aboulafia said. \u201cBut it\u2019s about to be.\u201d ",

            "title": "Astra\u2019s stock takes wild ride after rocket launch",
            "text": "In the minutes after Astra \u2014 a US-based startup \u2014 launched its rocket from a remote site in Alaska Tuesday afternoon, investors appeared ready to believe that the company had, once again, failed to keep the mission on track. Astra\n            \n                (ASTR) confirmed on Twitter that the rocket had made it to orbit, but it wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether its payload \u2014 a group of small satellites for a variety of customers \u2014 safely deployed into orbit. During a webcast of the launch, Astra\u2019s director of product, Carolina Grossman, warned that the company wouldn\u2019t know immediately if the satellites deployed safely, as the rocket wasn\u2019t in a position to send ground readings in the minutes after it reached orbit.  Following the launch, 30 minutes of silence went by. Astra\u2019s stock shed more than 10% of its value, and trading was briefly halted. But then, another update came: \u201cWe can confirm the successful deployment of the satellites on Spaceflight\u2019s Astra-1 mission today,\u201d the company wrote on Twitter. But the company\u2019s stock didn\u2019t immediately reverse. Twenty minutes after confirming the success, its stock price was still down more than 3%.  The ordeal highlights how volatile it can be to invest in a rocket company \u2014 especially when they choose to set off a rocket during trading hours. Astra in particular has been on a wild ride in recent months. The company had five failures attempting to put a rocket into orbit before its first success in November 2021. That caused a massive surge in trading, taking the stock price up more than 30%. But then, in February, it notched another failure. Now, the company\u2019s stock is consistently below the $4 per share mark, way off its high of more than $16 per share. Astra is one of dozens of companies that plan to use relatively small, lightweight rockets to make frequent trips to space to drop off satellites \u2014 not to be confused with the far larger rockets launched by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, or the suborbital space tourism rocket developed by Jeff Bezos\u2019 company, Blue Origin.  Astra, Rocket Lab and California-based Virgin Orbit are among the only startups that have now proven their rockets can get the job done. And all of those companies have now gone public via SPAC, or \u201cspecial purpose acquisition company,\u201d which serve as investment placeholders on the stock market as the fund\u2019s backers hunt for an acquisition target. The target company then takes over the SPAC\u2019s trading symbol, allowing it to go public with little of the financial disclosure or scrutiny that comes with traditional IPOs. That\u2019s not to say Astra and the others can\u2019t or won\u2019t be successful. But the company is facing stiff competition. When asked in a company Q&A posted online how Astra plans to stand out in such a crowded industry, Adam London, Astra\u2019s founder and chief technology officer, said that \u201crockets are typically artisanal, crafted objects. You make one at a time, and they\u2019re very complicated. But when you really get into it, they don\u2019t need to be that complicated, particularly when you\u2019re not flying people or critical national assets, and they don\u2019t absolutely, positively have to work 100% of the time.\u201d In other words, Astra plans to mass produce rockets to make them cheaper, but it doesn\u2019t put too much emphasis on having a pristine success rate. And that means its stock is likely to continue to be a wild ride for the foreseeable future. But that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, said Micah Walter-Range, president of space consulting firm Caelus Partners. \u201cThe stock swings related to Astra\u2019s launch can be seen as a positive sign because investors are watching the company\u2019s progress and are actively engaging with the space industry,\u201d he said via email. \u201cThe market moves also indicate that this is still an emerging industry, and we look forward to the day when launches are viewed in the same routine way as airline flights, where investors monitor the overall trends but not each individual flight.\u201d",

            "title": "Germany will buy US-made F-35 fighter jets as it ramps up military spending after Russia\u2019s Ukraine invasion",
            "text": "Germany has announced that it will buy 35 US-made F-35A fighter jets, the first major arms purchase to be publicly confirmed since Chancellor Olaf Scholz committed to ramping up his country\u2019s defense spending in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  The German government has made these decisions alongside a choice to become more active in European defenses. Scholz has also taken dramatic steps to limit Germany\u2019s economic ties to Russia, including halting the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.  The F-35s will replace Germany\u2019s aging fleet of Tornados, the only planes in the Luftwaffe\u2019s inventory capable of carrying US nuclear bombs that are stored in the country in case of war breaking out in Europe.  The decision to buy F-35s is significant as it will make Germany\u2019s air force more compatible with the rest of NATO and other European defense partners who either operate or intend to purchase F-35s.  The US Defense Department said earlier this year that US Air Force F-35As in Europe would be certified to deploy the nuclear bombs before 2023.  The F-35 comes in three versions, A, B and C, with just the F-35A being outfitted with nuclear capabilities.  The fighter jets will be a significant upgrade for Germany. While the Tornado, which has been in active service since the 1980s and will be phased out by 2030, was capable of carrying US nuclear weapons, it has long been considered an out-of-date option in modern warfare.  \u201cThe Tornado was designed to penetrate air defenses by flying low, at transonic speeds. Going from that to the F-35 which combines stealth with unmatched situational awareness against aerial and ground-based threats, and its own electronic warfare capabilities \u2026 it\u2019s just night and day,\u201d said Justin Bronk, airpower and technology research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute.  \u201cAny situation where you are dropping a NATO nuclear weapon would involve penetrating the most formidable air defense networks in the world. Flying low and fast as the Tornado would into that is simply not credible in 2022,\u201d he added.  The purchase of these jets comes in the broader context of an enormous Germany shift in defense strategy over the past three weeks. Germany, a country that has resisted becoming a military power since the end of World War II, has pledged to dramatically increase its defense budget in line with the 2% NATO requirement.   Scholz said that the increase in spending, which will leap from \u20ac47 billion in 2021 to \u20ac100 billion in 2022, was an acknowledgment that Germany \u201cwill have to invest more in the security of our country to protect our freedom and democracy.\u201d  The increase in spending will make Germany the best-funded military in Western Europe and, post-Ukraine, it seems likely that Germany will be actively seeking to play a more prominent role in European security.  The prospect of Germany suddenly playing this larger role may cause some degree of concern in other European capitals. France, previously the biggest military voice in the European Union, has been a cheerleader of closer European defense integration. It is unclear how a new, better equipped German military will fit into the EU\u2019s long-term defense thinking nor how it will act within NATO. ",

            "text": "\u201cWe really didn\u2019t intend selling them,\u201d says Kevin Regan over the phone from the northwest of Ireland.  Converting a slice of airplane into a sleek and durable home office had been a personal project in 2021, but after his sister-in-law put photos of the cabin on social media, requests rolled in and things started to snowball.  Now, Regan and his business partner Shane Thornton \u2013 both builders by trade \u2013 have started their own company named Aeropod, recycling commercial airplanes into home offices, glamping pods and ready-made accommodation.  They\u2019ve only spent \u20ac100 (about $110) so far on advertising (the company\u2019s still \u201cbrand new out of the wrapper!,\u201d says Regan) but they\u2019ve already sold 11 pods and are preparing to have more shipped to wherever clients want them.  Airplanes are built to last. Strong, thickly insulated, and made of sturdy aluminum alloys. And with some 15,000 aircraft estimated to be due for retirement in the next 20 years, there\u2019s a steady supply of them available for dismantling and recycling. \u201cThey were end-of-life, and they were flown in, and then every part was broken up and sold all over the world,\u201d says Regan.  The first plane they worked with was an IndiGo airline Airbus A320 sourced via Cardiff Airport in Wales. The initial pod took four months of fine-tuning to get it to the refined design they were looking for.  The pods are available in customized sizes, ranging from a dinky three-window to a spacious 10-window with a bedroom, en suite and kitchenette.  The overhead storage cabins are removed, but the window blinds still pull down as before and \u201ceverything else including the floor is the original aeroplane,\u201d says Regan.  Internal walls and floors are fully insulated and the rooms can be kitted out with USB sockets, LED lighting and heaters. The glass doors \u2013 specially designed to fit an A320 \u2013 are double-glazed and insulated for year-round use.  \u201cWe can deliver it and it\u2019s ready to go, once you have a concrete base in,\u201d says Regan. \u201cYour office is live.\u201d The pods are pre-made and have a built-in lifting system, so that if you move, the pod can move too.  He points to the benefits of recycled plane pods as being long-lasting, self-contained units. \u201cIt\u2019s just as good as a house,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no maintenance, just washing \u2013 same as your car.  Some customers are going to wrap them, like you\u2019d wrap your car, but there\u2019s no need to. The painting is perfect.\u201d  Prices start at around \u20ac20,000 and go up to about \u20ac37,000  for the most deluxe customizations. It\u2019s early days for Aeropod, but they hope to perhaps expand operations to England and are open to commissions from wherever. Says Regan, \u201cWe can deliver these anywhere. There is no limitation to where we can take them.\u201d  Aeropod aren\u2019t the only company operating in the recycled airplane space. A decommissioned British Airways jet has been reborn as a  $1,300 per hour \u201cparty plane\u201d for hire at England\u2019s Cotswold Airport.  Cotswold Airport is where Welsh company Aerfin carry out disassembly operations on end-of-life planes. Up to 90% of a discontinued plane can be reused or recycled. Last year, its operations director Simon Bayliss talked CNN through the process.  The remains might be turned into anything from dog training centers to restaurants to aircraft simulators.  A nose-to-tail approach to leftovers doesn\u2019t just belong in the kitchen. ",

            "text": "Pete Davidson will become the latest celebrity to fly to space with Jeff Bezos\u2019 rocket company, Blue Origin, in a brief, suborbital flight slated for later this month. The company announced Monday morning that Davidson, the Saturday Night Live Star who\u2019s become a pillar of entertainment intrigue amid his relationship with Kim Kardashian, will fly alongside five paying customers on Blue Origin\u2019s 60-foot-tall New Shepard rocket. The launch is slated for March 23 at 8:30 am CT, according to Blue Origin. The announcement comes after CNN confirmed earlier that Davidson was in talks with the company for a seat aboard its supersonic rocket, which launches vertically from a rural Texas launch pad on Bezos\u2019 ranch. After years of quiet development, Blue Origin\u2019s space tourism rocket made its crewed launch debut last year with Bezos, flying alongside a heroine of the space community, Wally Funk, his brother Mark Bezos and a paying customer.  Since then, Blue Origin has been making headlines for flying other well-known names on two subsequent flights, including Star Trek star William Shatner and Good Morning America host Michael Strahan.  Blue Origin\u2019s goal is to make these suborbital spaceflights a mainstay of pop culture, giving a 10-minute supersonic joy ride to welcomed guests \u2014 which thus far have mostly been celebrities \u2014 and anyone else who can afford it. Davidson will be joined on his flight by five paying customers. They include Marty Allen, an investor and the former CEO of a party supply store; Jim Kitchen, an entrepreneur and business professor; George Nield, a former associate administrator for the Federal Aviation Administration Office of Commercial Space Transportation; Marc Hagle, an Orlando real estate developer and his wife, Sharon Hagle, who founded a space-focused nonprofit. The crew will spend a few days training at Blue Origin\u2019s facilities in West Texas before the flight day, when they\u2019ll climb into the New Shepard crew capsule that sits atop the rocket. After liftoff, the rocket will tear past the speed of sound, and near the top of its flight path, will detach from the capsule. As the rocket booster heads back toward the Earth for an upright landing, the crewed capsule will continue soaring higher into the atmosphere to more than 60 miles above the surface where the blackness of space is visible and the capsule\u2019s windows will offer sweeping views of the Earth. As the flight reaches its apex, the passengers will experience a few minutes of weightlessness. Bezos notably spent his time in weightlessness throwing Skittles and flipping around in the cabin. Others have been glued to the window. As gravity begins to pull the capsule back toward the ground, the passengers will again experience intense g-forces before sets of parachutes are deployed to slow the vehicle down. It will then touch down at less than 20 miles per hour in the Texas desert. Because the flights are suborbital \u2014 meaning the don\u2019t generate enough speed or take the right trajectory to avoid being immediately dragged back down by Earth\u2019s gravity \u2014 the whole show will last only about 10 minutes. Blue Origin is the first company to begin offering regular suborbital space tourism flights. Its chief competitor, Virgin Galactic, notably had its first crewed flight \u2014 which included founder Richard Branson \u2014 before Bezos\u2019 flight last July. But Virgin Galactic has yet to follow up that flight with another crewed flight after it later became clear that the company\u2019s space plane had traveled out of its designated flight path. The company now says its undergoing unrelated technology upgrades and may return to flight later this year. SpaceX is the only private company that offers trips to orbit. The company completed the first-ever all-civilian flight to orbit last September, taking a billionaire and three chosen crewmates on a three-day trip. And later this month, the company plans to take four paying customers on a flight to the International Space Station, which orbits about 200 miles above Earth. Blue Origin does have plans to build a rocket powerful enough to reach orbit, called New Glenn. And, in light of the news that Russia may no longer sell rocket engines to the United States, those plans are more pressing than ever. The engines Blue Origin plans to use for New Glenn, the BE-4, will also be used on an upcoming launch vehicle designed by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing that is responsible for significant US national security launches. ULA currently relies on Russian RD-180 engines. Blue Origin did not have specific updates on BE-4 when reached for comment.",

            "text": "As Russia\u2019s economy gets pummeled by increasingly severe western sanctions for its invasion of Ukraine, the country\u2019s crucial airline industry could soon find itself on life support. Russian airlines have been essentially cut off from much of the world. But that is the least of the industry\u2019s problems. Russia\u2019s domestic airline industry could soon become a mere shell of its former self due to restrictions on its operations.  Sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union mean that the world\u2019s two major aircraft makers, Boeing\n            \n                (BA) and Airbus\n            \n                (EADSF), are no longer able to supply spare parts or provide maintenance support for Russian airlines. The same is true of jet engine makers.  That means Russian airlines could run out of necessary parts within a matter of weeks, or fly planes without having equipment replaced as frequently as recommended to operate safely. \u201cThe priority of the Russian government doesn\u2019t include consumer safety and reliability,\u201d said Charles Lichfield, the deputy director of GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council, an international think tank. Russia\u2019s major carrier, Aeroflot, has been cut off from Sabre, which had provided the computing backbone that allowed the airline to easily book tickets. And aircraft leasing companies, which own about 80% of the nearly 900 commercial planes in Russia\u2019s fleet, have been ordered to repossess those planes by the end of this month. Those leased planes have a declared value of $13.3 billion, according to data from aviation analytics firm Cirium, although the true market value at the moment is likely a fraction of that. \u201cWithin a year Russia will cease to have any kind of viable airline industry,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory. He said the country\u2019s airline industry could soon find itself somewhere between the heavily sanctioned industries in Iran and North Korea. Airlines crucial to Russia\u2019s economy That poses a serious problem for Russia\u2019s overall economic activity.  Russia is the world\u2019s largest nation by landmass, more than twice the size of the continental United States. It needs to have a viable airline industry to keep its economy working, Lichfield said. \u201cRussians don\u2019t fly as much as Americans do. They don\u2019t fly to Siberia for vacation,\u201d he said. But the airline industry is a crucial link for businesses, not only for international flights, but also for domestic service for its energy sector, due to the need to transport engineers, other workers and equipment to and from its far flung oil fields.  \u201cIt is an important part of Russia\u2019s economy. They need that backbone. They need some basic domestic [airline] industry to remain in place,\u201d Lichfield said. Russian airlines\u2019 domestic operations are a fraction of the size of the domestic operations of the US airline industry, with about 7%  of the number of flights last year, according to Circium data. But unlike the US industry, it had fully recovered from the pandemic and actually flew 8% more domestic flights in 2021 than it did in 2019, while US domestic flights still trailed the 2019 total by 22%. With blows to the Russian economy from the myriad sanctions mounting, it is inevitable that its economy won\u2019t require all those flights in 2022, or likely for years to come. But the loss of essential parts and the possibility of aircrafts being repossessed means Russia\u2019s ability to recover in the future will be severely damaged. Planes could be seized Some of the companies leasing planes to Russian carriers are Chinese, and China has yet to impose any sanctions of its own. But it is possible that even Chinese leasing companies could feel compelled to try to take possession of the Boeing and Airbus jets they have leased to Russian airlines, Aboulafia said. That\u2019s because those Chinese companies don\u2019t want to risk any trouble buying planes from Airbus or Boeing in the future. \u201cThese are western jets. I\u2019m not sure how Chinese firms will treat the sanctions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the more important thing is these jets won\u2019t be supported with parts and maintenance any longer. It\u2019s a real issue if they lose their certificates of airworthiness, which can happen if proper records aren\u2019t kept, or especially if they\u2019re cannibalized for parts.\u201d China has already indicated it won\u2019t ship parts for those planes to Russia, according to a report on Russian news agency TASS which quoted Valery Kudinov, head of the aircraft airworthiness department at the country\u2019s Federal Air Transport Agency. Russia to fight efforts to repossess jets Russia announced plans for a new law Thursday that would block those planes from leaving the country. But that would set up a situation wherein its airlines will have trouble leasing planes in the future, even after the sanctions end. \u201cThe Russian airlines want to do business with the leasing companies. They suspect when all is said and done that they\u2019ll need airplanes in the future,\u201d said Betsy Snyder, credit analyst with Standard & Poor\u2019s who follows aircraft leasing companies. \u201cBut they\u2019re being told by the powers that be in Russia not to do that.\u201d It is much easier for the global aviation industry to live without Russia, which accounts for only about 1% of total commercial jet purchases, than it will be for Russia to live without US and EU aircrafts or parts. Russia\u2019s attempts to build its own commercial jets have produced aircraft of questionable safety which have found no buyers on the international market. Can a country as large as Russia live without a modern, viable airline industry? \u201cThat\u2019s a thesis that has never been put to the test,\u201d Aboulafia said. \u201cBut it\u2019s about to be.\u201d ",

JPMorgan\n            \n                (JPM) Chase, America\u2019s largest bank, similarly announced it is \u201cactively unwinding\u201d its Russian business and now pursuing any new business in the country. JPMorgan\n            \n                (JPM) cited \u201ccompliance with directives by governments around the world.\u201d The decision by two of Wall Street\u2019s most influential firms to get out of Russia deals another financial blow to Moscow.

Goldman Sachs did not detail the cost of its exit from Russia, though it\u2019s not likely to be large relative to the size of the bank.  As of the end of last year, Goldman Sachs had total credit exposure to Russia of $650 million, the bank said late last month in filings.  After accounting for collateral and other measures, Goldman\u2019s net credit exposure was just $293 million at the end of last year. Goldman Sachs said its total market exposure to Russia as of the end of last year stood at $414 million. Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) employs about 80 people in Russia, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. JPMorgan said its current activities in Russia are \u201climited\u201d and include helping global clients address and close out pre-existing obligations, helping clients manage Russia-related risks, acting as a custodian to clients and taking care of employees. Citigroup confirmed on Wednesday that it is continuing its previously announced efforts to exit its consumer business in Russia. Citi said it is operating that consumer business \u201con a more limited basis given current circumstances and obligations.\u201d  Citi said it is supporting corporate clients in Russia, including many American and European multinational corporations, as they suspend or unwind their business there.

            "text": "Amazon and Google owner Alphabet are two of the most dominant companies on Earth. Each is worth more than $1 trillion and is a leader in multiple industries. But neither stock is a member of Wall Street\u2019s most exclusive club: the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That may soon change. Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN) announced late Wednesday that it plans to do a 20-for-1 stock split at the end of May. While that won\u2019t change the value of the company, it means that one share, which now costs around $2,925, would trade for a little less than $150 based on current prices. Alphabet announced its own 20-for-1 stock split last month. The split takes effect in July. The price of Alphabet\u2019s most widely available class A shares, trading under the ticker symbol of GOOGL\n            \n                (GOOGL), currently cost about $2,600. So if the split happened today, the price would drop to around $130. Why does this matter for the Dow? The group of 30 venerable blue chip stocks is a price-weighted average and not a market cap weighted index like the S&P 500.  That means that if companies with quadruple digit stock prices were in the Dow, their moves would drastically skew the point value of the index every day. The company that currently has the biggest weighting in the Dow is UnitedHealth\n            \n                (UNH), by virtue of its $480 a share stock price. One could argue that the only reason Alphabet and Amazon aren\u2019t already in the Dow is because of their prohibitively high stock prices. After all, they are the third and fourth most valuable companies in the S&P 500, trailing only Apple and Microsoft. Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT) has been in the Dow since 1999. Apple\n            \n                (AAPL) was added to the index in 2015 after its own big stock split. Of course, adding Alphabet and Amazon would mean that two current Dow listed  companies would have to be removed. There are several logical candidates. Older tech firms Intel\n            \n                (INTC) and IBM\n            \n                (IBM) could be kicked out to make room for Amazon and Alphabet.   Insurance company Travelers\n            \n                (TRV) and drug store chain Walgreens\n            \n                (WBA) are the two smallest Dow components as measured by market valuation. So kicking them out could also make sense.  Walgreens, however, was just added to the Dow in 2018. It replaced long-time Dow member General Electric.\n            \n                (GE) The last major shakeup of the Dow took place in the summer of 2020. Salesforce\n            \n                (CRM), Amgen\n            \n                (AMGN) and Honeywell\n            \n                (HON) were added, replacing Exxon Mobil\n            \n                (XOM), Pfizer\n            \n                (PFE) and Raytheon.",

If approved by shareholders in May, the split will go into effect June 6.  Amazon closed Wednesday at $2,785 per share. If the stock split were to happen today, Amazon\u2019s stock would be worth $139 a share. Don\u2019t worry, Amazon stockholders (which is pretty much everyone with a retirement account, these days) \u2013 your stakes will still be worth the same. You\u2019ll be holding 20 times more shares when all is said and done. Companies split their stocks for numerous reasons: Splits can put their stock within the reach of smaller, individual investors. It helps companies gain liquidity and splits can create more demand for a company\u2019s stock. Although deep-pocketed institutional investors don\u2019t care about the company\u2019s overall stock price, individual investors might be turned off by high-priced shares. The growth of zero-fee trading apps, including Robinhood, E-Trade and others, have made stock splits much more important in recent years. Amazon\u2019s move may also be aimed to get it included in the famed Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tends to include less expensive stocks. Apple\n            \n                (AAPL), for example, announced a 7-for-1 stock split in 2014 and got included in the Dow in 2015. Amazon\u2019s split is no guarantee that it will be included in the Dow, but the index may want the world\u2019s most valuable retailer, which is also a major cloud provider and media giant. \u201cThis split would give our employees more flexibility in how they manage their equity in Amazon and make the share price more accessible for people looking to invest in the company,\u201d Amazon said in a statement.  In case potential shareholders weren\u2019t convinced, the company threw in another incentive to buy: a repurchasing program for $10 billion of its stock. That can help inflate the value of a company\u2019s shares by effectively pulling the supply of stock out of the market. Shares of Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN) rose 8% in extended trading.  Major company stock splits have become very in vogue in recent years. Apple and Tesla announced splits in 2020. But one company with an alarmingly high stock price has never split and said it never would: Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKA).  At $488,245 a share, Berkshire shares are unapproachable for most individual investors. That\u2019s why it offers its B-class shares, which have split in the past, for $325.",

Honda will handle production at one of its factories. Sony will be tasked with creating a platform that will provide mobility services, it said, without elaborating further. The Japanese conglomerate is best known for its electronic gadgets and entertainment products.  But it has recently signaled a desire to jump into the auto industry, unveiling its first prototype vehicle at the CES consumer tech trade show two years ago. Sony started testing the car, called the Vision-S 01, on public roads in Europe in December 2020. This year, the company took another step by confirming plans to launch an electric car company and debuting a new sports utility vehicle concept. \u201cWith our imaging and sensing, cloud, 5G and entertainment technologies combined with our content mastery, we believe Sony is well positioned as a creative entertainment company to redefine mobility,\u201d Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said at CES in January.

The F-35C crashed into the ocean after failing to make a successful landing on the USS Carl Vinson, while conducting \u201croutine flight operations\u201d on January 24, the release said. In order to retrieve the wreckage of the military aircraft from \u201capproximately 12,400 feet\u201d deep, a team of US Navy service members used a \u201cremotely-operated vehicle\u201d called the CURV-21 to attach \u201cspecialized rigging and lift lines to the aircraft\u201d at the bottom of the ocean, the release said. After attaching the rigging and lift lines, the crane on the diving support construction vessel used to recover the aircraft \u201clowered to the seafloor and connected to the rigging.\u201d Once attached, the team lifted the aircraft to the ocean\u2019s surface and put it on the vessel to transport it, the release said. \u201cThe aircraft will be delivered to a nearby military installation to aid in the ongoing investigation and evaluated for potential transport to the United States,\u201d the release said. It took the team 37 days to recover the wreckage. It included members of the US 7th Fleet Task Force 75 and the Naval Sea Systems Command\u2019s Supervisor of Salvage and Diving. They used \u201cthe diving support construction vessel Picasso\u201d to retrieve the wreckage.  Seven people were injured, including the pilot, who ejected from the plane, and six others aboard the carrier during the incident in January when the jet crashed. The $100 million fighter jet is the newest in the Navy fleet. After the crash, the US Navy said it planned to retrieve any remnants of the aircraft from the ocean. The F-35C contains some of the Navy\u2019s most advanced technology, and the analysts said Washington would want to keep it out of Beijing\u2019s hands. However, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was aware that a US Navy stealth fighter had crashed in the South China Sea but \u201chad no interests in their plane.\u201d \u201cWe advise [the US] to contribute more to regional peace and stability, rather than flexing force at every turn in [the South China Sea],\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said. Videos of the crash emerged shortly after it happened, showing the aircraft bursting into flames as it struck the flight deck of the USS Carl Vinson. Shortly after the crash, Navy officials described the damage to the Carl Vinson as superficial and said it quickly resumed normal operations.",

            "text": "Russia\u2019s space agency, Roscosmos, will no longer deliver Russian-made rocket engines to the United States, Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin said on state television, ending a decades-long relationship between US and Russian rocket makers. \u201cToday we have made a decision to halt the deliveries of rocket engines produced by NPO Energomash to the United States,\u201d Rogozin said, according to the Russian news site Tass. \u201cLet me remind you that these deliveries had been quite intensive somewhere since the mid-1990s,\u201d Rogozin said. Tass reported that the ban will apply to RD-180 engines that power US-based United Launch Alliance\u2019s (ULA) Atlas V rockets. ULA\u2019s CEO, Tory Bruno, however said via Twitter that ULA has already taken delivery of the RD-180s it needs in the near-term, and he does not foresee the fallout from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine having any impact on ULA\u2019s operations. ULA, a private space transport company, is in the process of abandoning its line of Atlas rockets in favor of a new line of rockets, called Vulcan, that will use engines made by Jeff Bezos\u2019 US-based rocket company Blue Origin. It\u2019s not clear when that rocket will be ready to fly. The ban also applies to RD-181 engines that are used on Northrop Grumman\u2019s Antares rockets, according to Russian state media. Those rockets are used to power uncrewed resupply missions to the International Space Station. Northrop Grumman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \u201cAs of today, there were plans to deliver an additional 12 RD-181 engines in 2022-2024 and talks were also held with the United States on the delivery of RD-181M engines with improved operational characteristics, but we believe that in this situation we can no longer supply the United States with our best engines,\u201d the Roscosmos head said. The US does have other means of getting cargo to and from the space station. SpaceX\u2019s Dragon spacecraft are frequently used for that purpose. \u201cLet them fly on something else, on their brooms,\u201d Rogozin told a Russian TV station Thursday.",

            "text": "The reservation system that is the backbone of airlines around the world has terminated its agreement with Aeroflot, crippling the majority government-owned carrier\u2019s ability to sell seats. The technology company Sabre says Aeroflot has been removed from its global distribution system, meaning Russia\u2019s largest airline will not be shown in its \u201cmarketplace used by travel agencies, travel websites and corporations around the world to shop, book and service flight reservations.\u201d \u201cSabre has been monitoring the evolving situation in Ukraine with increasing concern,\u201d said Sabre CEO Sean Menke in a statement. \u201cWe are taking a stand against this military conflict.\u201d Removal from global distribution systems (GDS) is one step, but other technology services provided to Aeroflot are still in play, experts say. Sabre has not suspended \u201cautomation services,\u201d according to airline industry analyst Robert Mann, of R.W. Mann & Company. \u201cSabre provides reservations, passenger services, operations, network planning and management systems. These are core automation systems, commercial, operations and planning systems, without which airlines cannot function, except minimally and manually,\u201d Mann said via email. In its statement, Sabre said that the company \u201cwill evaluate whether additional actions would be appropriate, taking into account legal considerations and any counter measures that could be implemented in response.\u201d It underlined that it is complying with all sanctions in response to a question about its other services. Suspending automation services would have a dire impact on domestic operations, says Brett Snyder, aviation blogger and president of Cranky Flier. \u201cAeroflot would be forced to try to find an alternate vendor, but that is not something you can switch overnight. It would be highly disruptive, and if Sabre was serious about punishing Russia, it would be looking at ways to sever those contracts,\u201d Snyder said via email. Another travel technology company, Amadeus, said Thursday it has started suspending the distribution of Aeroflot fares in its systems. \u201cWe will not sign any new contracts in Russia and we continue to evaluate our existing portfolio of work in Russia in parallel,\u201d Amadeus said in a statement. \u201cAt the same time, we continue to assess and evaluate the potential impact of international sanctions imposed on Russia and any counter-measures by Russia,\u201d the statement said. Moves to take Aeroflot flights out of global distribution are the latest measures against Russia\u2019s aviation industry after most of the western world closed airspace to Russian aircraft.  Earlier this week, Boeing and Airbus said they would no longer do business with Russian customers.  Boeing has suspended major operations in Moscow and temporarily closed its office in Kyiv and has suspended \u201cparts, maintenance and technical support services for Russian airlines,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cAirbus has suspended support services to Russian airlines, as well as the supply of spare parts to the country,\u201d Airbus said in a statement. Last week, Delta Air Lines ended its codeshare booking agreement with Aeroflot. The travel sector is among many industries suspending ties with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. In addition to impacts in aviation, tour companies and cruise lines have halted and rerouted operations involving Russia. ",

            "text": "Jack Sweeney, a Florida teen who tracks Elon Musk\u2019s private jet online has a new aviation-themed target: Russian oligarchs and billionaires.  The 19-year-old, who rejected Musk\u2019s $5,000 offer to delete his Twitter account, recently launched two new automated Twitter handles \u2014 @RUOligarchJets and @Putinjet \u2014 following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The two profiles have amassed nearly 300,000 followers combined and provide nearly live updates of the private jets\u2019 movements along with pictures of maps locating them. Sweeney told the Wall Street Journal that people have long been telling him to start Twitter accounts like this, and those requests ramped up after sanctions took aim at Russia\u2019s richest. Russia\u2019s oligarchs face economic chaos at home and punishment by the West after President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine. The United States and its allies have responded by sanctioning wealthy individuals who are close to the Kremlin. Some of the jets tracked by the accounts include Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, businessman Alisher Usmanov and Leonid Mikhelson, the billionaire chairman of Russian gas producer Novatek.  In an interview with Bloomberg, Sweeney said he was stunned by the size of planes the Russian oligarchs use.  \u201cThe aircrafts these oligarchs have are absolutely crazy,\u201d Sweeney said. The country\u2019s richest are traveling on commercial-sized aircrafts like an Airbus A319 and Boeing 737. \u201cTheir planes are huge compared to other jets.\u201d In total, the accounts track more than 40 planes and helicopters linked to Russian oligarchs. He has invited others to help bolster the amount of planes that can be tracked.  Sweeney\u2019s Twitter account tracking Musk is still live. He told Journal that he\u2019d delete it only in exchange for a new Tesla Model 3.  ",

            "text": "The world\u2019s largest plane, the Antonov AN-225, has been destroyed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials, generating alarm and sadness among the aviation world in which it occupies almost cult status. The enormous aircraft, named \u201cMriya,\u201d or \u201cdream\u201d in Ukrainian, was parked at an airfield near Kyiv when it was attacked by \u201cRussian occupants,\u201d Ukrainian authorities said, adding that they would rebuild the plane. \u201cRussia may have destroyed our \u2018Mriya\u2019. But they will never be able to destroy our dream of a strong, free and democratic European state. We shall prevail!\u201d wrote Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Twitter.  There has been no independent confirmation of the aircraft\u2019s destruction. A tweet from the Antonov Company said it could not verify the \u201ctechnical condition\u201d of the aircraft until it had been inspected by experts. Ukrainian state defense company Ukroboronprom, which manages Antonov, on Sunday issued a statement saying the aircraft had been destroyed but would be rebuilt at Russia\u2019s expense \u2013 a cost it put at $3 billion. \u201cThe restoration is estimated to take over 3 billion USD and over five years,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOur task is to ensure that these costs are covered by the Russian Federation, which has caused intentional damage to Ukraine\u2019s aviation and the air cargo sector. In a later statement, the company said the airplane had been in on the ground near Kyiv on February 24 undergoing maintenance.  \u201cAccording to the director of Antonov Airlines, one of the engines was dismantled for repairs and the plane wasn\u2019t able to take off that day, although the appropriate commands were given,\u201d it said.   Russian forces claimed to have captured Hostomel airfield, where the AN-225 was located, on Friday. A CNN team on the ground witnessed Russian airborne troops taking up positions. Satellite images from Maxar Technologies show significant damage to part of the hangar in which the AN-225 is stored. Meanwhile, NASA\u2019s Fire Information for Resource Management System detected multiple fires at the airport, including at the hangar where the plane is kept. The fire at the hangar was detected at 11:13 a.m. on Sunday, according to the NASA data, which is obtained from a number of NOAA and NASA satellites. It is not clear if these fires at the airport are the result of actual fires or explosions from military strikes. If confirmed, the attack would mark a shocking end to an aircraft that has seen more than 30 years of service dating back to the days of the Soviet Union.  The AN-225 was sometimes drafted in to help airlift aid during crises in other countries. In the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake it delivered relief supplies to the neighboring Dominican Republic. During the early days of the Covid pandemic it was used to transport medical supplies to affected areas. Its popularity in the aviation world meant it often drew large crowds wherever it went, particularly when it made star appearances at air shows.  Some of its fans took to social media on Sunday to express their dismay at claims of the aircraft\u2019s destruction. \u201cMriya - You will always be remembered!\u201d wrote aviation blogger Sam Chui on Twitter.  To this day, Mriya remains the heaviest aircraft ever built. Powered by six turbofan engines, she has a maximum payload weight of 250 tonnes, which can be carried inside or on its back. It boasts the largest wingspan of any airplane in operational service. Only one An-225 was ever built by the Kiev-based Antonov company, which came up with the design. It first took flight in 1988 and has been in service ever since. Construction was begun on a second plane, but it was never finished. The story of the An-225 begins back in the 1960 and \u201970s when the Soviet Union was locked in a race into space with the United States. By the end of the 1970s, the need arose for transporting large and heavy loads from their places of assembly to the Baikonur Cosmodrome, the sprawling spaceport in the deserts of Kazakhstan that was the launchpad for Yuri Gagarin\u2019s pioneering space voyage of 1961. The cargo in question was the Buran spacecraft, the Soviet Union\u2019s answer to NASA\u2019s Space Shuttle. Since there were at the time no airplanes capable of carrying it, the Antonov company was ordered to develop one.",

            "text": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway reported a nearly $40 billion profit in the fourth quarter, up more than 10% from the same period of 2020. Profits more than doubled for the full year, to just shy of $90 billion. Operating earnings, Buffett\u2019s preferred measure of profitability, soared 45% in the fourth quarter to $7.3 billion and rose 25% for the full year to about $27.5 billion.  The company added it bought back $6.9 billion worth of stock during the quarter, a move which also helped to boost its earnings per share.  Berkshire Hathaway released its latest results Saturday morning, along with Buffett\u2019s annual letter to shareholders and details about its in-person shareholder meeting in Omaha at the end of April. Berkshire Hathaway said attendees must show proof of vaccination for Covid-19 to attend. Berkshire is booming In the letter, Buffett said 2021\u2019s success was in large part due to its \u201cfour giants,\u201d  the company\u2019s insurance operations, Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, its massive energy business and Berkshire\u2019s nearly 5.6% stake in Apple\n            \n                (AAPL). Apple is by far Berkshire\u2019s largest holding and the stock enjoyed a total return (including dividends) of 35% last year. Buffett called Apple CEO Tim Cook \u201cbrilliant\u201d in the letter.  Buffett said in the letter investors might be surprised to learn how much Berkshire depends on the American industrial economy for its success. Berkshire also owns Duracell batteries, Benjamin Moore paints, homebuilder Clayton and flooring company Shaw, for example. \u201cMany people perceive Berkshire as a large and somewhat strange collection of financial assets. In truth, Berkshire owns and operates more US-based \u2018infrastructure\u2019 assets \u2013 classified on our balance sheet as property, plant and equipment \u2013 than are owned and operated by any other American corporation,\u201d Buffett wrote.  Buffett also pointed out Berkshire Hathaway paid $3.3 billion in federal income taxes last year as well as \u201csubstantial state and foreign taxes.\u201d  \u201c\u2018I gave at the office\u2019 is an unassailable assertion when made by Berkshire shareholders,\u201d Buffett joked. Wall Street has rewarded Berkshire for its strong results. The company is now valued at nearly $715 billion, and its stock is not far from its all-time high. Berkshire is up 7% this year while the broader market has fallen, as investors have flocked to value stocks as safe havens.  Buffett has benefited handsomely as well. His net worth is about $115 billion, according to Forbes, making him the eighth-richest person on the planet. Annual meeting is back in Nebraska Berkshire has nearly $147 billion in cash and generates a big chunk of its profits from Geico and its other insurance businesses. Berkshire\u2019s A shares\n            \n                (BRKA), which famously have not split, trade for nearly $480,000 apiece.  The class B shares\n            \n                (BRKB), which trade at a more affordable price of around $320, are in the S&P 500\n            \n                (SPX) and are more widely held by average individual investors.  Many of those shareholders are expected to descend on Omaha during the last weekend of April for Berkshire\u2019s first annual shareholder meeting with attendees since 2019.  The meeting will take place April 30. Berkshire said Saturday Buffett and fellow vice chairman Charlie Munger; Ajit Jain, who oversees the insurance operations; and Greg Abel, who oversees the conglomerate\u2019s non-insurance businesses, will be there in person to answer questions.  The meeting will also be webcast on CNBC. Yahoo Finance had been the online home of the meeting previously. The company\u2019s 2020 annual meeting was virtual due to the pandemic while the 2021 meeting was held in Los Angeles in order to be closer to the home of longtime Buffett friend and business partner Munger, who is 98 and lives in Southern California.  Buffett announced after last year\u2019s virtual shareholder meeting Abel will be his successor as CEO.

The retailer, which didn\u2019t explicitly mention Nike in its earnings report, said Friday that no single supplier is expected to account for more than about 60% of its total purchases for fiscal 2022. Nike accounted for 75% of its sales in 2020 according to Foot Locker\n            \n                (FL)\u2019s most recent annual report.  Foot Locker, whose suppliers also include Adidas and Puma, projected that this year\u2019s sales at stores open for at least a year would decline by 8% to 10%. Shares are down about 40% for the year. Nike\n            \n                (NKE), Foot Locker\u2019s biggest supplier, is ramping up its focus on its direct-to-consumer business. Last year, Nike\n            \n                (NKE) said it was shifting to selling more of its products through its own shops, websites, mobile apps and select retailers, cutting ties with many stores. The apparel company has significantly slashed the number of traditional retailers it sells to in recent years to improve profits and tighten control over how its products are showcased. In December, Nike announced it will stop selling to DSW. Nike\u2019s go-it-alone strategy has hurt some independent sneaker and athletic shops, which rely heavily on selling Nike \u2014 the largest shoemaker in the world \u2014 to attract customers. Selling goods on its own website and physical stores nets Nike more than double the profit it would receive from selling through wholesale partners. The company also gains much tighter control over the shopper experience and pricing. That\u2019s a big advantage for a premium brand like Nike that wants to present merchandise to customers in enticing and consistent ways, and prevent products from being discounted too heavily.

Russia\u2019s Federal Agency for Air Transport said in a statement Friday that it was banning UK registered flights, as well as aircraft owned, leased or operated by a person associated with the United Kingdom, from transiting the country\u2019s airspace. The Russian agency said the measure was taken in response to the decision by the UK government Thursday to ban Aeroflot and other Russian airlines from British airspace. That was part of a package of sanctions announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson after Russia invaded Ukraine.  \u201cWe apologize for the inconvenience but this is clearly a matter beyond our control,\u201d British Airways said in a statement. \u201cWe are notifying customers on canceled services and are offering a full refund.\u201d BA was flying three times a week to Moscow. It said it would also have to reroute some services to Asia, potentially causing longer flight times.  Russia\u2019s flag carrier Aeroflot had been operating direct flights between Moscow and London\u2019s Heathrow and Gatwick airports, according to its website.  \u201cNo aircraft on a scheduled service which is owned, chartered or operated by a person connected with Russia, or which is registered in Russia shall fly in United Kingdom airspace,\u201d the UK Department for Transport said in a bulletin. The restrictions went into effect at midnight, and are due to expire on May 23. English Premier League soccer club Manchester United said Friday it was dropping Aeroflot as a sponsor. Russia\u2019s attack has already forced the closure of Ukrainian airspace, and the fallout from the crisis will lead more carriers to reroute flights, adding to costs at a time of rising fuel prices.  \u201cOn Thursday evening, we took the decision to start avoiding Russian airspace and our flight paths will continue to be adjusted for some Virgin Atlantic passenger services between the UK, Pakistan and India,\u201d a Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said. \u201d We apologize for any inconvenience caused to customers by slightly longer flight times.\u201d Virgin Atlantic is also suspending cargo flights between London and Shanghai while it considers rerouting those services.  The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said Ukraine\u2019s skies and airspace in Russia and Belarus within 100 nautical miles of borders with Ukraine could pose risks, Reuters reported. \u201cThe impact for us is not huge because right now we are only flying to a small number of destinations in Asia and we can reroute our flights,\u201d said Luis Gallego, CEO of IAG, the parent company of British Airways that also owns Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling.  \u2014 Rob North, Pete Muntean, Anna Chernova and Vasco Cotovio contributed reporting.

The French aircraft maker has announced plans to test hydrogen fuel technology using a modified version of one of its A380 jetliners, which were discontinued last year. Airbus has partnered with CFM International, a joint venture between GE and Safran Aircraft Engines, on the hugely significant hydrogen demonstration program.  The plane manufacturer will use an \u201cA380 flying testbed fitted with liquid hydrogen tanks\u201d to trial propulsion technology for its future hydrogen aircraft. \u2018Flight laboratory\u2019 \u201cOur ambition is to take this (A380) aircraft and add a stub in between the rear doors at the upper level,\u201d says Glenn Llewellyn, vice president for zero emission aircraft at Airbus, in a video posted on the Airbus YouTube channel. \u201cThat stub will have on the end of it a hydrogen powered gas turbine.\u201d He goes on to explain that the aircraft will be fitted with hydrogen storage and hydrogen distribution, which will feed its engine with the chemical element.  According to Llewellyn, the aim of the \u201cflight laboratory\u201d is to learn more about hydrogen propulsion systems in real ground and flight conditions, thus enabling Airbus to press on with its plans for a zero-emission aircraft in just over a decade. Test flights are currently estimated to take place in 2026, provided everything goes to plan. The news comes over a year after Airbus unveiled three hydrogen-based concepts under the ZEROe banner. \u201cThis is the most significant step undertaken at Airbus to usher in a new era of hydrogen-powered flight since the unveiling of our ZEROe concepts back in September 2020,\u201d Sabine Klauke, chief technical officer for Airbus, said in a statement. \u201cBy leveraging the expertise of American and European engine manufacturers to make progress on hydrogen combustion technology, this international partnership sends a clear message that our industry is committed to making zero-emission flight a reality.\u201d  Guilt-free flying? Aviation generates 2.8% of global CO2 emissions, and the global fuel consumption by commercial airlines reached 95 billion gallons in 2019. The global aviation industry has pledged to slash emissions to half their 2005 levels by 2050. A number of air carriers are moving towards sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in order to help reduce the environmental impact of flying, with British Airways\u2019 parent company IAG revealing plans to power 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030 and United Airlines completing its first successful flight by 100% sustainable fuel last year. However, Airbus is hedging its bets on hydrogen, which can potentially reduce aviation\u2019s carbon emissions by up to 50%, according to the airplane manufacturer. \u201cI strongly believe that the use of hydrogen \u2013 both in synthetic fuels and as a primary power source for commercial aircraft \u2013  has the potential to significantly reduce aviation\u2019s climate impact,\u201d says Guillaume Faury, chief executive for Airbus. Meanwhile, aviation firm ZeroAvia is currently developing a 19-seater aircraft that will operate commercial hydrogen-electric flights between London and Rotterdam from 2024.",

            "text": "Home Depot was the Dow\u2019s best-performing stock in 2021, soaring more than 55% thanks to strong demand from consumers in what was a red hot housing market. But shares are off to a bumpy start this year. Shares of Home Depot have fallen 24% because of fears about eventual rate hikes from the Federal Reserve hurting the housing market and consumer spending. Mortgage rates have already started to climb.  Concerns of a housing slowdown may be overblown, however: Home Depot\n            \n                (HD) reported fourth quarter earnings and revenue Tuesday that topped Wall Street\u2019s forecasts, with profit surging 17% and sales at stores open at least a year climbing a healthy 8.1%. The home improvement retail giant also announced a 15% increase in its quarterly dividend to shareholders and issued a cautious, but mostly upbeat outlook for 2022. Home Depot said it expects \u201cslightly positive\u201d sales growth and that earnings will grow in the low single digits. The stock was down 9% Tuesday morning, though\u2026largely due to the more guarded guidance. \u201cWhile we are encouraged by the consistent and resilient demand we\u2019ve seen for home improvement, broader uncertainty remains with respect to the impact of inflation, supply chain dynamics and how consumer spending will evolve through the year,\u201d said Home Depot chief financial officer Richard McPhail in a conference call with analysts.  But CEO Craig Menear said in the earnings press release that the 2021 results were \u201ca testament to investments we have made in the business, our ability to execute with agility, and our associates\u2019 relentless focus on our customers.\u201d   This is Menear\u2019s last quarter as Home Depot CEO. Menear, who has been the head of the company since November 2014, is stepping down as CEO on March 1 but will remain chairman. Home Depot\u2019s long-time chief operating officer, Ted Decker, is succeeding Menear as CEO. Menear\u2019s tenure was a lucrative one for Home Depot investors. The stock has surged more than 255% since November 2014, easily outperforming both the S&P 500\n            \n                (SPX) and a broader index of retail stocks\n            \n                (XRT) during that time. Home Depot did lag rival Lowe\u2019s\n            \n                (LOW), though.  Lowe\u2019s, which will report its latest earnings Wednesday morning, has soared nearly 290% since November 2014. Lowe\u2019s, which is now run by former Home Depot and JCPenney executive Marvin Ellison, outperformed Home Depot slightly in 2021, too. Shares of Lowe\u2019s fell 4% Tuesday. In addition to tough competition, Home Depot also has to contend with the impact that inflation and supply chain concerns are having on consumers\u2019 wallets.  While rising prices for lumber, copper and other housing materials helps boost sales, some shoppers may start to pull back on spending because of inflation. \u201cDemand from regular consumers is now somewhat choppier that it was during the height of the pandemic,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, in a report Tuesday. \u201cMost people are still fairly committed to spending on their homes, but the number of projects they want to undertake and the amount of money they are prepared to commit to home improvement going forward is less certain than it was a year ago,\u201d Saunders added.",

            "text": "Eviation, the company behind what is supposed to be the world\u2019s first all-electric passenger airplane, has undergone an unexpected change in leadership just before the plane\u2019s projected first flight \u2013 and the company and the now-former CEO are offering different takes on the situation.  Eviation, an Israel-based company, has said it plans three versions of its all-electric plane: a \u201ccommuter\u201d variant holding nine passengers and two pilots, an executive version holding six passengers, and one specialized for cargo. The company has said the nine-passenger version, which it calls \u201cAlice,\u201d will be able to fly for one hour and about 440 nautical miles after 30 minutes of charging.  Eviation initially aimed for the Alice to take flight before 2022, but said poor weather conditions in the Pacific Northwest at the end of the year had hindered testing. The Alice has been undergoing several taxi tests since late 2021, and last month then-CEO Omer Bar-Yohay told CNN Business that its first flight was \u201cjust weeks away.\u201d Bar-Yohay did not mention an impending CEO shift at that time. On Monday, Bar-Yohay, who was also a co-founder of Eviation, left the company after seven years, and he was replaced by interim CEO and current Eviation president Gregory Davis. The company says the change is part of a \u201cplanned succession process\u201d as Eviation shifts from planning to production of the Alice, according to a statement. An executive search process is underway to fill the CEO position long-term, it said.  But Bar-Yohay said that while it is time for a new direction, his departure is the result of a dispute within the company.  \u201cThis is definitely part of a natural progression. It is time for the company to turn a corner and really transition from proving our prototype to manufacturing,\u201d Bar-Yohay told CNN Business. \u201cThat said, there is a long-standing disagreement about how and what exactly does the company need to do going forward, and that created some friction between myself and the main shareholder of the company.\u201d  Bar-Yohay declined to answer questions as to the nature of the disagreement. While Bar-Yohay said the change is not a big shock, he had not been aware of how and when it would be announced.  Eviation\u2019s main shareholder is Richard Chandler, the New Zealand-born billionaire owner of the Clermont Group. The Singapore-based Clermont Group includes MagniX, Eviation\u2019s sister company and propulsion provider. Just last month, Eviation executive chairman and MagniX CEO Roei Ganzarski stepped down from both roles. \u201cI do believe some of the underlying reasons [for our departures] are similar,\u201d Bar-Yohay said. \u201cThere was no way to make this go any differently.\u201d The Clermont Group has not responded to multiple requests for comment. Though Ganzarski has not commented on the reasons behind his own departure from both companies, he made the announcement last month \u201cwith a heavy heart,\u201d according to a post on his LinkedIn. \u201cI have no doubt that the future of aviation is electric. It has to be for the sake of our children and grandchildren. It is no longer a question of if, but only when and who. I leave magniX and Eviation positioned to continue their leadership in this field.\u201d Ganzarski did not comment when asked if his exit was due to the same circumstances Bar-Yohay describes. \u201cOmer did a tremendous job building a leading aerospace company and phenomenal aircraft with very limited resources,\u201d Ganzarski told CNN Business when asked about the leadership change. \u201cI am very proud of what he and his team did.\u201d Bar-Yohay will remain involved with Eviation as a board member and investor moving forward, he has said.",

            "text": "A conversation with 98-year old Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger is never dull.  Munger talked about his reasons for investing in China, how he still hates bitcoin and why windowless dormitories aren\u2019t as bad as people make them out to be in a wide-ranging chat at the annual meeting for Munger\u2019s newspaper publisher Daily Journal\n            \n                (DJCO) in Los Angeles Wednesday,  One of the first questions for Munger was about China. He was asked how he can trust the economic data that comes out of the communist nation, especially since other top investors, such as DoubleLine\u2019s Jeff Gundlach, have shunned China. Gundlach has called China \u201cuninvestable.\u201d  Daily Journal owns a big stake in China\u2019s Alibaba\n            \n                (BABA). Munger said in Wednesday\u2019s meeting, which was streamed exclusively on Yahoo Finance, that he sees more value in China than in the US stock market and praised the country for being a modern nation.  Later on during the meeting, Munger said former Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping was one of the world\u2019s greatest leaders due to economic changes made during his tenure that opened up the nation to the West, modernized China and helped reduce poverty. (Xiaoping, however, was also the leader during the deadly 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square.) Munger also continued to bash bitcoin\n            \n                (XBT) and other cryptocurrencies, investments that both he and Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett, have done for years.  He said he had no regrets about not investing in bitcoin, even though cryptocurrencies are now a nearly $2 trillion market. Munger said he was proud he\u2019s avoided bitcoin and compared it to a \u201cvenereal disease.\u201d Another Daily Journal shareholder asked Munger if he had any insight as to who made the decision at Berkshire Hathaway to invest in Activision Blizzard\n            \n                (ATVI) in the fourth quarter of last year, just weeks before Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT) announced a nearly $70 billion acquisition of the video game maker. Munger had no comment but he then praised Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, despite the fact that Kotick has been criticized for a sexual harassment scandal at the company.  He also took a potshot at people who criticized the windowless student dormitories at schools where Munger has donated money.  Munger defended the decision to build housing without windows by saying that there are many rooms on cruise ships that have no windows. He said the architect who complained about the design was an \u201cignoramus.\u201d Investors may have another chance to hear Munger\u2019s thoughts in a few months.  Berkshire Hathaway is planning to have its annual shareholder meeting at the end of April in Omaha and Munger expressed optimism that he and others will be able to attend it live, despite lingering concerns about the Omicron variant of Covid-19.",

            "text": "Sometimes in investing, a little luck goes a long way. Just ask Warren Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha is set to make a handsome profit from a new investment in video game maker Activision Blizzard that Berkshire Hathaway made during the quarter before Microsoft announced its plans to buy it. According to a filing late Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKB) bought nearly 14.7 million shares of Activision Blizzard\n            \n                (ATVI) in the fourth quarter of 2021. The stake was worth about $975 million at the time, an average price of $66.53 a share. But Activision Blizzard is now trading at about $81.50 a share following Microsoft\u2019s\n            \n                (MSFT) nearly $70 billion deal, announced last month. That means that Berkshire\u2019s stake is now worth about $1.2 billion, which works out to a quick 22.5% gain.  And if the deal is approved, Berkshire could make even more than this. Microsoft\u2019s offer for Activision Blizzard values the company at $95 a share in cash. The investment in Activision Blizzard comes a little bit out of left field for Berkshire, given that Buffett is known more for buying stakes in stodgy, more value oriented businesses such as banks, consumer staples like Buffett\u2019s beloved Coca-Cola\n            \n                (KO), and oil stocks.  Still, Activision Blizzard, before the Microsoft takeover, was also the kind of classic, out of favor value stock that Buffett loves. Shares of Activision Blizzard tumbled nearly 30% in 2021 due to a sexual harassment scandal and the delayed launch of several key games. And during the past few years, Berkshire has made more moves into tech. Apple\n            \n                (AAPL) is now the firm\u2019s largest investment and Berkshire even has a small stake in Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN) and cloud software firm Snowflake.  It\u2019s also not clear if Buffett was the driving force behind the decision to invest in Activision Blizzard or if the call was made by one of the investment lieutenants who manage Berkshire\u2019s massive portfolio with Buffett: Ted Weschler and Todd Combs. Combs is also CEO of Berkshire-owned Geico. Berkshire does not have an investment in Microsoft, even though Buffett is good friends with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.  Buffett stepped down as a trustee of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation last year shortly after Bill and Melinda announced plans to divorce. Gates resigned from the boards of both Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway in 2020.  Bill Gates also no longer has an executive role with Microsoft and he has donated a large portion of the shares that he had owned in the company to charities. Gates and Buffett are currently the fourth and sixth most wealthy people on the planet, according to Forbes.",

            "title": "A billionaire CEO is on track to go further into space than any human in 50 years",
            "text": "Jared Isaacman \u2014 the billionaire CEO of payments processing company Shift 4 \u2014 is buying three more flights with SpaceX, the first of which is scheduled for this year and could put Isaacman and SpaceX on track to travel deeper into space than any human has traveled in a half century.  The first flight in the series of missions, which are being called \u201cPolaris\u201d after the North Star, is planned for late this year and will last up to five days and include a crew of Isaacman and three other people. It\u2019s expected to travel out to the Van Allen radiation belt, which has an inner band that stretches from about 400 to 6,000 miles above Earth, in part to help the crew research how radiation in space affects the human body. Radiation remains a serious concern for spaceflights to the moon and Mars, as SpaceX says it aims to do, because they would require prolonged exposure to radiation, which can lead to an \u201cincreased risk of cancer and degenerative diseases\u201d and other long-term impacts, according to NASA. When asked on a press call Monday, Isaacman said the Gemini missions of the 20th century, which set altitude records at the time, are a guidepost for how high the first Polaris mission will travel. Gemini missions reached as high as about 850 miles \u2014 or about three times higher than where the International Space Station orbits. Isaacman declined to share a specific altitude for the flight.  During that mission, the crew will conduct a space walk, a first for anyone traveling aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule. Isaacman made the announcement on NBC\u2019s Today Show on Monday morning and in an interview with the Washington Post. Isaacman, who gained international attention when he purchased the first SpaceX all-tourism flight dubbed \u201cInspiration 4,\u201d said that the first Dragon mission will be followed by a second Dragon mission shortly thereafter. Those two missions will pave the way for the first-ever crewed mission on SpaceX\u2019s forthcoming Starship rocket, the one Elon Musk hopes will one day ferry people to Mars.  \u201cWe\u2019re gonna go farther into space than humans have gone since we last walked on the moon,\u201d he told the Today show. It\u2019s not clear if all this will go according to plan, nor has SpaceX said whether it will need to complete additional testing before Isaacman can make his trek to deep space. SpaceX also has not addressed what if any updates Crew Dragon will need to complete the mission safely. So far, the spacecraft has carried astronauts only on trips to low-Earth orbit, or the area of space directly surrounding Earth. The Inspiration 4 mission marked the highest Crew Dragon has flown thus far, at at a roughly 360-mile altitude, and Monday\u2019s announcement indicated the first Polaris mission will travel at least twice that far. It\u2019s not clear how much these missions will cost Isaacman, and he declined to comment on the matter Monday morning. He also did not reveal how much he paid for the Inspiration 4 mission last year, though he said he paid less than $200 million. \u201cWe know space is expensive,\u201d Isaacman said when asked about the costs of the Polaris program during a media call, adding that it\u2019s already \u201cfully funded.\u201d \u201cCosts will come down just as they have for any other groundbreaking technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a contribution from both SpaceX and myself towards the important goals we want to achieve with the Polaris program.\u201d The Inspiration 4 mission was billed as a St. Jude Children\u2019s Hospital fundraiser, and it fetched a total of $243 million for the organization. Isaacman donated about $100 million, Musk put in another $50 million and the remainder was raised through public donations. The Polaris missions are also expected to support the same cause.  On the first Polaris mission, Isaacman will be joined by veteran Air Force fighter pilot Scott Poteet and two SpaceX operations engineers \u2014 Sarah Gillis, and Anna Menon, who will serve as the onboard medical officer. Isaacman will be the only crewmember with prior spaceflight experience. Apart from his spaceflight ambitions, Isaacman also flies jets recreationally. Most recently, he was seen piloting an Alpha Jet, often used for training pilots, over SpaceX\u2019s Starship facilities in South Texas. Poteet is a former vice president at Shift 4 who previously spent 20 years in the Air Force. Poteet also served as a flight director on the ground supporting Inspiration 4. He and Isaacman are also frequent flying partners. Gillis and Menon could be the first SpaceX employees to travel to space.  Details about the space walk that the Polaris crew is planning to conduct on the first flight are light, but a press release states they will use \u201cSpaceX-designed extravehicular activity (EVA) spacesuits, upgraded from the current intravehicular (IVA) suit.\u201d The IVA suit refers to the pressurized black-and-white spacesuits that NASA astronauts and the Inspiration 4 crew have worn aboard Dragon during launch and reentry.  But exiting the spacecraft while it\u2019s in orbit will require a much heavier duty system of protection. NASA has described its EVA suit as \u201ca miniature spaceship shaped like a human body that protects the astronaut from the dangers of being outside a vehicle while in space or on the Moon,\u201d offering protection from \u201cradiation, dust, debris, and extreme temperatures.\u201d According to to its website, the space walk will be conducted when the Crew Dragon is flying about 300 miles above Earth, or roughly the same altitude as the ISS. Much of the technical details remain unknown. Crew Dragon does not have an airlock, for example, which would allow a single person to exit the spacecraft in an EVA suit while the remaining crew members stay safely locked inside their airtight, pressurized cabin. Without an airlock, the entire cabin will become depressurized \u2014 as it did during spacewalks conducted by NASA astronauts during the Gemini missions. \u201cFor this mission, the suit that we\u2019re going to be designing will be a single suit that we would launch [in] and then similarly use for the EVA,\u201d Gillis said.  \u201cWe\u2019ll certainly be doing so safely,\u201d Menon added. Also on the first Polaris mission, the crew will test out the use of Starlink \u2014 SpaceX\u2019s satellite-based internet business \u2014 for in-space communications. Thus far, Starlink has only been used to beam internet connectivity to customers on the ground, but the Polaris press release suggests the system could be used to support communications during orbital flights. During the mission, the crew will also conduct some research related to health, including a study on decompression sickness and another focused on how astronauts might mitigate Spaceflight Associated Neuro-Ocular Syndrome, or SANS, a condition that can alter the structure of the eyes and brain that is brought on by weightlessness and has been reported by up to 70% of astronauts. Symptoms can include loss of near vision, blind spots, headaches and loss of depth perception.  Starship The schedule for Isaacman\u2019s Starship flight isn\u2019t exactly clear. During a presentation about Starship in Texas last week, Musk said that while he\u2019s hopeful the vehicle \u2014 which has so far conducted only brief, suborbital \u201chop tests\u201d \u2014 will make its first orbital flight test this year, without a crew. That, however, could depend on whether federal regulators give SpaceX approval to launch Starship out of South Texas, where the company has already set up an orbital launch pad and the vast majority of Starship resources are located. That could mean that Isaacman is leap-frogging the first billionaire who purchased a Starship mission \u2014  Japanese fashion mogul Yusaku Maezawa. Maezawa paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount of money to secure a seat for himself and a group of artists on a Starship trip around the moon, hoping it could take off as soon as 2023. Maezawa is still in the process of deciding who he\u2019ll take with him.  Musk also said during the presentation that he hopes Starship will cost less than $10 million per flight within a few years, which, if obtainable, would be far cheaper than any other rocket on the market.  Starship is expected to be far more powerful than any rocket humanity has ever built. Musk has said it would boast twice the thrust of the Saturn V rockets that powered the moon landings last century.",

The move comes after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission voted unanimously last month to sue to block the deal over antitrust concerns.

            "text": "Most companies have reported fourth quarter earnings. The biggest takeaway for investors? This is a stock picker\u2019s market. Some companies are thriving while their competitors are not. Just look at how Disney\n            \n                (DIS) posted blockbuster numbers while Netflix\n            \n                (NFLX) disappointed investors. And the recent stumbles for Facebook owner Meta Platforms\n            \n                (FB) weren\u2019t a sign of broader tech weakness. Google owner Alphabet\n            \n                (GOOGL), Apple\n            \n                (AAPL) and Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN) all posted extremely strong results. With that in mind, we figured it\u2019s time to bring back the CNN Business Stocks We Love feature.  Using screening software from data provider Refinitiv, we looked for companies in the main three S&P indexes that trade at reasonable valuations, have strong earnings growth prospects, healthy sales, high returns on equity and little debt.  We started with 1,500 companies and whittled down the list from there. Here\u2019s a closer look at nine companies that made the cut. Interestingly, Meta looks attractive. The stock is certainly cheaper now following its massive drop after its earnings report. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s company is still posting solid profit and revenue growth. So investors may be overreacting to concerns about the company\u2019s metaverse pivot. Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS), which fell after its latest earnings report when the investment bank disclosed a big increase in worker pay, is also on the list. The company continues to benefit from the boom in mergers and initial public offerings. Several other companies whose stocks have slid lately made it through our screening process too.  Semiconductor supply chain issues haven\u2019t gone away, which has hurt companies like chip equipment leader Applied Materials\n            \n                (AMAT) and processor manufacturer Analog Devices\n            \n                (ADI). Both might be attractive investments now. Homebuilder DR Horton\n            \n                (DHI) may be another bargain as investors worry about rising mortgage rates leading to a slowdown in housing. Still, rates remain relatively low. The lack of inventory in the housing market could also help DR Horton\n            \n                (DHI), which raised its 2022 sales forecast earlier this month.   Finally, a bunch of retailers and consumer companies are in Wall Street\u2019s discount bin. Farm equipment giant Tractor Supply\n            \n                (TSCO), hair care company Ulta Beauty\n            \n                (ULTA), furnishings retailer Williams-Sonoma\n            \n                (WSM) and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods\n            \n                (DKS) all made our cut. All eyes on Charlie You wouldn\u2019t think that a relatively small newspaper publisher\u2019s annual shareholder meeting would attract a lot of interest from Wall Street. But Daily Journal\n            \n                (DJCO) is no ordinary media company.  The company is run by Charlie Munger, the vice chairman of Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKB) who has been in the news quite a bit over the past year.  Munger, 98, has made headlines over his plans for windowless dorms at schools where he has donated money, as well as favorable comments about Beijing\u2019s crackdown on top Chinese companies. Munger, who is not known for mincing words, could have colorful comments about these topics (and many others) at Daily Journal\u2019s shareholder meeting on Wednesday afternoon. Investors may also hear more about some of the stocks that Munger likes. Despite his comments about China and Big Tech, Daily Journal has been increasing its investment in Alibaba\n            \n                (BABA) over the past few months. Like Buffett, Munger is a fan of big banks. Daily Journal owns stakes in Bank of America\n            \n                (BAC), US Bancorp\n            \n                (USB) and Wells Fargo\n            \n                (WFC). It\u2019s an investor in South Korean steelmaker Posco\n            \n                (PKX), too. The Daily Journal meeting will be a virtual event due to the pandemic. But it\u2019s possible that investors could see Munger in person at the end of April. As of right now, Berkshire Hathaway is planning to have its annual \u201cWoodstock for Capitalists\u201d shareholder meeting in person in Omaha. The 2021 meeting was held in Los Angeles, closer to Munger\u2019s home in Southern California. The 2020 Berkshire meeting was a virtual affair.

            "text": "Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian sent a letter to US Attorney General Merrick Garland last week reiterating his call for the Justice Department to prosecute unruly passengers and place them on a no-fly list. A short response came on Tuesday. \u201cThe Department of Justice is continuing to prioritize the investigations and prosecutions of those who engage in criminal behavior that threatens the safety of passengers, flight crews, and flight attendants,\u201d said  Joshua Stueve, department spokesman, in a statement. \u201cWe are fully committed to holding accountable those who violate federal law. We will be referring Delta\u2019s letter to appropriate departments.\u201d Bastian had called for a no-fly list in 2021 and repeated his call for urgent action on Friday, February 4. \u201cIn addition to the welcome increase in enforcement and prosecutions, we are requesting you support our efforts with respect to the much-needed step of putting any person convicted of an on-board disruption on a national, comprehensive, unruly passenger\u2018\u201cno-fly\u2019 list that would bar that person from traveling on any commercial air carrier,\u201d Bastian wrote to Garland, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by CNN.  \u201cThis action will help prevent future incidents and serve as a strong symbol of the consequences of not complying with crew member instructions on commercial aircraft,\u201d Bastian said in the letter. The letter was first reported by Reuters. Bastian first called for a no-fly list in September in a memo to employees first reported by CNN. President Joe Biden said in October that he has instructed the Justice Department to address rising violence on airplanes as some passengers resistant to mask requirements have threatened airline staff. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in late October that a federal no-fly list for violent airplane passengers \u201cshould be on the table.\u201d The existing federal no-fly list is used to prevent terrorism. \u201cIt is completely unacceptable to mistreat, abuse or even disrespect flight crews,\u201d Buttigieg told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. Delta kicked two unruly passengers off Flight 1582 from Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta on Tuesday.  \u201cDelta has zero tolerance for unruly behavior at our airports and on our flights as nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and flight crews,\u201d the airline said in a statement related to the incident.   2021 was a very bad year for bad behavior Last year was the worst on record for unruly airplane passenger behavior in the United States, according to Federal Aviation Administration data.  A whopping 5,981 reports of unruly passengers were logged by the FAA as of December 31. Of those, 4,290 \u2013 nearly 72% - were mask-related incidents.  It\u2019s been a little more than a year since the FAA announced a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for unruly passenger behavior that skips warnings or counseling and goes directly to penalties, which can include heavy fines and jail time.  The policy, spurred by incidents tied to masks and violence at the US Capitol, was originally set to expire at the end of March 2021. It was extended at least until the federal mask mandate is lifted. As of February 1, there have been 323 reports of unruly passenger behavior so far this year, according to FAA tracking. Of those, 205 were mask-related incidents. Seventy-three investigations have been initiated, with 26 enforcement action cases initiated so far this year. The unruly passenger incident rate has dropped about 50% since record highs in early 2021, the FAA notes on the page where it tracks incidents, \u201cbut there remains more work to do.\u201d",

            "title": "Elon Musk launched his own Tesla roadster to space four years ago. Where is it now?",
            "text": "Four years ago this week, the most powerful operational rocket in the world, SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy, made its inaugural launch from Florida and tore into outer space carrying nothing other than Elon Musk\u2019s personal Tesla roadster.  The cherry red sports car \u2014 which is occupied by a spacesuit-clad mannequin nicknamed \u201cStarman\u201d \u2014 is still out there, taking a lonely, oblong orbital path around the sun, traveling as far away as Mars\u2019 orbit and, at other times, as close as Earth\u2019s orbit.  The car is not on some scientific voyage. This was a test launch, so SpaceX needed a dummy payload \u2014 and Musk previously said he wanted it to be the \u201c[s]illiest thing we can imagine.\u201d So he picked his own luxurious Tesla roadster. As of Monday, the roadster was about 234 million miles from Earth and about 200 million miles from Mars, passing through a no-man\u2019s land of outer space, according to the tracking website whereisroadster.com, which uses NASA\u2019s data to keep tabs on the car. The roadster is more than likely still in one piece, Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told CNN Business, but it\u2019s likely been dinged by some meteoroids during its jaunt through the cosmos.  Over the past four years, the roadster has traveled nearly 2 billion miles and completed about 2.6 loops around the sun, mostly through a barren, empty vacuum, according to the website.  But it will occasionally get fairly close to other celestial objects. In 2020, the vehicle made its first close approach to Mars, passing within 5 million miles of the planet \u2014 or about 20 times the distance between the Earth and the moon.  According to NASA data, the roadster isn\u2019t likely to pass near another planet until 2035 when it\u2019ll brush by Mars again. It\u2019ll then make two passes within a few million miles of Earth in 2047 and 2050.  One academic paper estimated that the chances the car collides with the Earth within the next 15 million years at about 22%. The odds of it crashing into Venus or the Sun each stand at 12%. Those aren\u2019t very high probabilities, Hanno Rein, a professor of astrophysics at the Univeristy of Toronto who co-authored the paper, told CNN Business.  The complex and unpredictable realities of traveling through space make it difficult to predict exactly what path the Tesla will take. Rein said that because there isn\u2019t much scientific value in studying the roadster\u2019s trajectory, astronomers aren\u2019t too interested in pointing their high-powered telescopes in its direction to gather more data. The last time the roadster was observed was in March 2018, about a month after it launched, Rein said.  If the car does wind up taking a crash course with Earth, we\u2019ll have to hope it\u2019s ripped into pieces as it slams back into the Earth\u2019s thick atmosphere. (Spaceborne objects running into Earth are actually fairly common, and typically they burn up in the atmosphere during entry. Such hits rarely impact populated areas.)  The ultimate fate of the roadster likely won\u2019t be known for many millions of years. But for his part, Musk said in 2018 that he hopes that humans will have already established settlements on other planets in the solar system, and Musk\u2019s \u201cdescendants will be able to drag [the roadster] back to a museum.\u201d",

In one close-up view the plane hits the deck, bursts into flames and then spins in front of the camera full frame. The second angle captures the fiery wreck as it careens along the deck then slides off into the water. As the $100 million fighter makes its approach to the vessel, crew can be heard yelling \u201cWave off, wave off,\u201d the term used for a plane to abort a landing attempt, accelerate and fly around to try again. But the warning to the pilot comes too late to avoid the crash. \u201cThat\u2019s really, really scary,\u201d said Peter Layton, a former Royal Australian Air Force officer now at the Griffith Asia Institute. Layton noted that the F-35 seemed to have control problems on its approach to the carrier. \u201cAs the aircraft is coming down the flaps are working overtime backwards and forwards. It looks like the pilot has lost control and is suffering oscillations,\u201d he said. He said the crash suggested to him the jet was not using an automatic landing system, digital controls which help limit the number of times the pilot must make corrections to get the plane safely on the deck.  \u201cIt\u2019s a really clever piece of software that links up the flight controls [the flaps] and the throttles and also gives the pilot some display so the pilot can monitor the system and fine tweak,\u201d Layton said. \u201cThis is a reasonably new system that came out of the F-35 program.\u201d The deployment on the Vinson was the first operational one for the F-35C, which only entered service in 2019. The US Air Force version of the stealth fighter, the F-35A and the Marine Corps version, the F-35B, were put into service earlier. The US Navy confirmed the authenticity of the video to CNN, but it has not yet released a cause of the crash. \u201cWe are aware that there has been an unauthorized release of video footage from flight deck cameras onboard USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) of the F-35C Lightning II crash that occurred Jan. 24, in the South China Sea. There is an ongoing investigation into both the crash and the unauthorized release of the shipboard video footage,\u201d Cmdr. Zach Harrell, spokesperson for Commander, Naval Air Forces, said in an email. The back-to-back images seen on the screen suggest it is a recording of the incident that was being replayed on the carrier when the recording was made. \u201cThe US Navy does videotape from several angles every landing so that they can go back and critique every pilot\u2019s landing,\u201d Layton said.  This video is the second unauthorized leak of the collision. Less than a week after the crash, video emerged of the plane on approach as did a still image of it floating momentarily on the surface of the sea. Seven people were injured in the accident including the pilot, who ejected from the plane, and six others aboard the carrier. The end of the video shows the crew responding to the incident within seconds, spraying down the deck of the carrier with foam to prevent further damage. Shortly after the crash, Navy officials described the damage to the Carl Vinson as superficial and said it quickly resumed normal operations. They also said efforts had begun to raise the wreckage of the stealth jet from the bottom of the sea. Analysts said raising the aircraft would likely be a complex operation, and one that would be monitored by China, which claims almost all of the South China Sea as its territory. The F-35C contains some of the Navy\u2019s most advanced technology, and the analysts said Washington would want to keep it out of Beijing\u2019s hands. However, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was aware that a US Navy stealth fighter had crashed in the South China Sea, but \u201chad no interests in their plane.\u201d \u201cWe advise [the US] to contribute more to regional peace and stability, rather than flexing force at every turn in [the South China Sea],\u201d China\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said. Though the Navy has not revealed where in the South China Sea the crash occurred, Beijing claims almost all of the 1.3 million square mile (3.3 million square kilometer) waterway and has bolstered its claims by building up and militarizing reefs and islands there. Chinese naval and coast guard vessels maintain a constant presence in South China Sea waters.",

            "title": "Spirit and Frontier Airlines plan to merge",
            "text": "Spirit and Frontier Airlines on Monday announced a $6.6 billion merger, a combination of low-fare carriers that would create America\u2019s fifth-largest airline. The companies have yet to say what brand they\u2019ll fly under or who would lead management of the new airline. The combined company would offer more than 1,000 daily flights to over 145 destinations. The merged carrier would leapfrog JetBlue\n            \n                (JBLU) and Alaska Air\n            \n                (ALK) in the number of miles flown by paying passengers, according to 2021 statistics, putting them behind the four major airlines that control about 80% of the nation\u2019s air traffic \u2013 American, Delta\n            \n                (DAL), United\n            \n                (UAL) and Southwest Airlines\n            \n                (LUV).  \u201cThis transaction is centered around creating an aggressive ultra-low fare competitor to serve our guests even better, expand career opportunities for our team members and increase competitive pressure, resulting in more consumer-friendly fares for the flying public,\u201d said Spirit CEO Ted Christie. There are only 519 routes currently served by both airlines, out of 2,832 combined routes, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. That\u2019s equal to just 18% of their routes, suggesting a combination will have only limited impact on reducing competition for passengers. Like most of the US airline industry, Spirit and Frontier have been struggling with losses the last two years as air travel plunged during the pandemic. On Monday, Spirit reported a 2021 loss of $440.6 million, excluding special items, such as federal assistance that went to all US airlines. That was an improvement from the $719.6 million it lost on that basis in 2020. Frontier reported it lost $299 million on that basis in 2021, roughly the same as in 2020.  But the two airlines\u2019 combined fourth quarter revenue was down only 2% from their combined revenue in the final three months of 2019. That\u2019s much closer to pre-pandemic levels than at the four major airlines. Much of that is due to the fact they depend primarily on leisure travelers, not business passengers, who have been slower to return to flying. Low fares, low approval The combination would bring together two airlines that have very low base fares, but charge passengers extra for most things, including carry-on bags. Although their passengers might like the low fares, many don\u2019t like the experience of flying with them.  Spirit had by far the highest number of passenger complaints, with 13.25 complaints per 100,000 passengers, according to stats from January through September 2021 kept by the US Department of Transportation. JetBlue had the second most complaints on that basis with 6.85, while Frontier had the third most in the industry with 5.76. Frontier had by far the worst rate of complaints in the same period of 2020, when it recorded 60.24 complaints per 100,000 customers.  Frontier and Spirit also had the industry\u2019s worst customer satisfaction ratings, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Frontier suffered some badly-timed service problems Monday morning, soon after it announced the planned merger. A technology issue temporarily resulted in all of its flights being grounded, the FAA disclosed. The statement from the airline said the problem was quickly fixed. \u201cEarlier today, we experienced a technology issue which led to some flight delays and cancellations,\u201d it said in a midday statement. \u201cThe issue was identified and has been resolved. We are working to restore our flight schedule for the balance of the day.\u201d Regulatory hurdles Whether or not the merger will be approved by federal antitrust regulators remains uncertain. The Biden administration has taken a much more aggressive approach on antitrust issues. It recently blocked an alliance between American and JetBlue that fell short of a full merger. Increasing competition in the airline industry is one of the issues that the Biden administration has cited as a priority. Executives involved in the proposed Spirit-Frontier deal say they believe the merger will bring more competition to the industry. \u201cThis is the type of transaction the administration should in fact support,\u201d Bill Franke, chair of Frontier\u2019s board and the managing partner of Indigo Partners, Frontier\u2019s majority shareholder, said in an interview Monday on CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s beneficial to the consumers. It\u2019s beneficial to the employees. It\u2019s beneficial to the communities that the airlines serve. And at the end of the day, even in combination, these two airlines will control less than 10% of the market.\u201d But experts aren\u2019t sure the regulatory approval will be as easy as the airlines hope. \u201cIn a normal environment we would not expect any regulatory hurdles given the relatively small market share of each airline. But given the Biden Administration\u2019s \u2018big is bad\u2019 approach we would expect some objection,\u201d said Savanthi Syth, airline analyst with Raymond James. The US airline industry has been greatly reshaped by mergers in the last 25 years. The four largest airlines today were formed from a series of mergers of 10 airlines. This would be the United States\u2019 first airline merger since Alaska Air purchased Virgin America in 2016. The $6.6 billion value of the deal includes assumed debt, such as aircraft leases. The value of the stock and cash being exchanged would be $2.8 billion, based on Friday\u2019s closing price. Frontier would be the purchasing airline in this deal, as Spirit\n            \n                (SAVE) shareholders would receive 1.9126 shares of Frontier plus $2.13 in cash for each of their shares. That would represent about a 20% premium based on Friday\u2019s closing price. But Spirit\n            \n                (SAVE) shares are up only 13% in midday trading, while Frontier shares were little changed, suggesting investor uncertainty about the deal being completed.",

            "text": "Two of the world\u2019s biggest video game companies are feeling the pressure as the console wars heat up.  Shares of Sony and Nintendo, the makers of the PlayStation and Switch respectively, stumbled Thursday as the two Japanese giants cut their forecasts for sales of the consoles.  The fall comes as both companies grapple with the ongoing global chip shortage, and just weeks after Xbox-maker Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT) announced plans to acquire Activision Blizzard\n            \n                (ATVI) in a blockbuster deal worth nearly $70 billion. Sony on Wednesday lowered its forecast for the popular PlayStation 5, saying it expected to sell \n            \n                11.5 million units in the fiscal year ending in March. That\u2019s down from 14.8 million units previously forecast. The company\u2019s shipments and guidance cut were \u201cdisappointing,\u201d said Kazunori Ito, a director at Morningstar.  Sony\u2019s overall games and network services unit, meanwhile, also posted an 8% drop in sales for the quarter ended December, compared to the same time the previous year. The company\u2019s shares fell 6% in Tokyo Thursday, despite beating analyst forecasts overall. The group\u2019s wins were largely attributed to its film and television division, including \u201clicensing revenues from the Seinfeld comedy series, and the success of the latest Spider-Man movie,\u201d Yu Okazaki, an analyst at Nomura, wrote in a note Wednesday. On Thursday, Nintendo\n            \n                (NTDOF), too, said that it may continue to suffer from global supply chain issues this year. The Kyoto-based giant once again reduced its sales forecast for the Switch, which was a big hit earlier in the pandemic.  It now expects to sell 23 million units by the end of the fiscal year, which concludes in March, down from previous projections of 24 million and 25.5 million units last November and May. Nintendo\u2019s stock closed down 2.8% Thursday, ahead of the presentation. But the company\u2019s overall results were broadly in line with expectations, according to Ito.  The shipments of Switch consoles was \u201cnot as bad\u201d as the market had feared, he told CNN Business.   There were also some bright spots. Nintendo hiked its software sales forecast by 10% through March, to 220 million units. That side of the business has proven \u201csolid,\u201d and drives the bulk of Nintendo\u2019s profits, even allowing it to slightly raise its overall financial forecast for the year, noted Ito. War of consoles Analysts have warned that the sale of Activision Blizzard to Microsoft could pose a serious threat for Sony, which has competed with the Xbox for decades. With Activision Blizzard, Microsoft would add popular series such as \u201cCall of Duty\u201d and \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d to its library \u2014 as well as the nearly 400 million monthly active players that come with them. However, this week, Sony made news of its own by announcing its acquisition of Bungie, the developer known for its creation of titles like \u201cHalo\u201d and \u201cDestiny.\u201d  The deal would help Sony bolster its intellectual property and make its overall \u201cgaming business more competitive,\u201d analysts at Nomura wrote in a note Tuesday.  Nintendo, meanwhile, is expected to be more shielded from competition concerns related to Activision Blizzard because \u201cpeople who want to play Nintendo\u2019s games purchase Nintendo\u2019s hardware,\u201d Ito added.  \u201cTherefore, Nintendo can [still] differentiate its platform from others.\u201d \u2014 Diksha Madhok contributed to this report.",

            "text": "There are many different places a retired plane can end up in its after life. Some return to the sky to fly for other airlines, others are recycled for parts (around 80 to 85% of an aircraft can be recycled) while a vast number are relocated to aircraft boneyards. One particular decommissioned British Airways jet is gearing up for a very action-packed future after being reborn as a unique events space for hire based at a UK airport. Suzannah Harvey, chief executive of the privately owned Cotswold Airport near Kemble in England, bought the Negus 747 for \u00a31 (around $1.30) back in October 2020 and has spent 14 months or so converting it into a trendy \u201cparty plane,\u201d with rates starting at about $1,300 an hour.  \u2018Party plane\u2019 A vast number of 747s have been decommissioned as airlines bring forward retirement dates for older aircraft due to the pandemic, with KLM, Air France, Delta, United and British Airways all retiring their 747 fleets in the past two years. Harvey came up with the idea for the events facility as various retired BA 747s arrived at storage and parts company Air Salvage International, which happens to be located at Cotswold Airport, and promptly went to the UK flag carrier with her proposal. However, the process was far from simple. In fact, the sale involved weeks of negotiations during which BA agreed that the economy section of the plane could be removed and Harvey vowed to ensure that the aircraft would be well looked after. \u201cIt took six weeks to do the negotiations for the contract,\u201d Harvey tells CNN Travel. \u201cWe have a duty of care to maintain her until it is uneconomically viable with any deterioration. But hopefully, she\u2019ll be with us for many years and generations to come.\u201d According to Harvey, BA allowed Cotswold Airport to choose from its fleet of retired 747s, and they opted for an iconic Negus.  Full makeover \u201cI think it\u2019s the most beautiful one they\u2019ve ever produced,\u201d she says. But it was once the team had signed on the dotted line that the hard work truly began. While much of the aircraft looks the same, including the livery and the cockpit, the economy section has been completely stripped out to create a party room and the galley has been restyled into a bar. In addition, the entire plane has been rewired with custom lighting in order to replicate the original onboard system while on the ground, as well as mains power. The ceiling panels in the economy section have been removed, along with the central luggage compartments, providing a better view of the inner workings of the aircraft, which first entered the British Airways fleet in February 1994, and took its last passenger flight on April 6, 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lengthy process to actually make it safe for public viewing, because these aircraft are designed to be in the air,\u201d adds Harvey.  \u201cSo there are a lot of safety features which would not meet health and safety regulations for an event space on the ground. So they have to be decommissioned.\u201d  Labor of love The makeover has cost nearly \u00a3500,000 ($671,000). However, Harvey points out that around \u00a3200,000 ($268,000) of that was spent on putting in a new concrete pad, and \u00a380,000 ($107,000) on rewiring costs. Although the work took far longer than expected, partly due to delivery issues as a result of the pandemic, the aircraft turned event space is finally ready to welcome guests. Its official launch will take place later this month. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely inundated with inquiries at the moment,\u201d says Harvey. \u201cIt\u2019s a very versatile events facility, so it can accommodate anything from a kid\u2019s birthday party, through to a new product launch or a corporate presentation.\u201d Upcoming bookings include a filming commission for a TV show, as well as a number of parties. The aircraft can also be hired for weddings at a cost of \u00a312,000 ($16,000) for 24-hours, which factors in set up and breakdown times, and the team already have a wedding booked in this spring.   \u201cThe whole of the aircraft has a wedding license,\u201d explains Harvey. \u201cSo you can get married in the cockpit if you want.\u201d Versatile facility While Harvey is extremely proud of the project, she admits that it wouldn\u2019t be financially viable for many due to additional fees such as airplane parking fees, which she says can cost around \u00a31,200 ($1,600) a week, depending on the location and the size of the aircraft. The cost of transporting a plane of this size is also significant.  \u201cWe\u2019re in a very fortunate position,\u201d she admits.  Although the space will be up and running shortly, there\u2019s still one unexpected issue that hasn\u2019t been completely ironed out yet. \u201cOne problem that we still haven\u2019t managed to solve is to get the toilet system working,\u201d she admits, before pointing out that airplane toilets are designed to work under pressurization when the aircraft is in altitude.  \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll nail that problem in the next six months or so. But at the moment, we\u2019ve got very posh loo units that are positioned outside.\u201d Although the process of converting the plane has been challenging and time-consuming, Harvey is extremely proud of the project and can\u2019t wait to start bringing revelers on board. \u201cI think it\u2019s a real achievement,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone else has done such a versatile event space like this in the world. Now it\u2019s time for her to start earning her keep.\u201d In addition to events, the airport will be opening up the facility for tours from March, and visitors will be able to book a place through a soon-to-launched app. Booking inquiries can also be made via Instagram.",

            "title": "Alice, the first all-electric passenger airplane, prepares to fly",
            "text": "The world\u2019s first all-electric passenger aircraft is preparing to take flight.  The Alice, a plane developed by Israeli company Eviation, went through engine testing last week at Arlington Municipal Airport north of Seattle. According to Eviation CEO Omer Bar-Yohay, the Alice is just weeks away from its first flight.  With battery technology similar to that of an electric car or a cell phone and 30 minutes of charging, the nine-passenger Alice will be able to fly for one hour, and about 440 nautical miles. The plane has a max cruise speed of 250 kts, or 287 miles per hour. For reference, a Boeing 737 has a max cruise speed of 588 miles per hour. The company, focused exclusively on electric air travel, hopes that electric planes that can fit 20 to 40 passengers will be a reality in seven to 10 years. A prototype of the aircraft, which debuted in 2019, has been going through low-speed taxi tests since December and will attempt a high-speed taxi test in the next few weeks. In these tests, the aircraft is sent down the runway at different speeds to test its own power and allow ground teams to monitor systems like steering, braking and anti-skid. Though the company initially aimed for the Alice to take flight before 2022, poor weather conditions in the Pacific Northwest at the end of the year hindered testing.  Eviation has developed three versions of the prototype: a \u201ccommuter\u201d variant, an executive version, and one specialized for cargo. The commuter configuration in testing holds nine passengers and two pilots, as well as 850 pounds of cargo. The executive design has six passenger seats for a more spacious flight, and the cargo plane holds 450 cubic feet of volume.  All of this is possible while reducing maintenance and operating costs of commercial jets by up to 70%, according to the company.   The electric aviation space is already growing more crowded with both startups and established aviation companies. NASA gave $253 million in September 2021 to GE Aviation and magniX to bring the technology to US fleets by 2035. Boeing is investing $450 million in Wisk Aero, a company building an all-electric, autonomous, passenger aircraft, and Airbus has been working on its own electric aviation endeavors since 2010. According to industry experts, the largest obstacle for electric aviation becoming the norm in passenger jets is the battery.  \u201cThe stumbling block is the battery technology just like with cars, but more so in airplanes. This is because with airplanes, the concern is the weight,\u201d said Ross Aimer, CEO of Aero Consulting Experts. \u201cAs soon as we have better battery technology, which I suspect will be in two or three years, that\u2019s when all these electric airplanes will eventually come.\u201d Twelve Alices are on order by international shipping company DHL, anticipated to be delivered in 2024. These planes, out of DHL Express\u2019s global fleet of more than 280 aircraft, are set to be used as cargo carriers making shorter distance trips. \u201cOur aspiration is to make a substantial contribution in reducing our carbon footprint, and these advancements in fleet and technology will go a long way in achieving further carbon reductions,\u201d said Mike Parra, CEO of DHL Express America, in an interview with CNN Business. Eviation has announced purchases of its proposed fleet by DHL and commuter airline CapeAir and says there are several more to be announced once Alice\u2019s first flight occurs. CapeAir\u2019s proposed fleet of Alices are expected to enter service in 2023 on routes connecting Boston, Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Nantucket and Hyannis.  While we seem to be getting closer to battery-powered air travel for some functions, not everything is nearly ready to go. Cross-ocean flights and jumbo jets are still years beyond the current science, for one. But the most pressing concern for electric aviation is regulation. The FAA has yet to put forward any clear guidelines or regulatory framework for electric airplanes, which fall under the category of Advanced Air Mobility, though Eviation says its is actively working with the FAA to achieve certification for production by 2024. \u201cSome certifications could require the FAA to issue special conditions or additional airworthiness criteria, depending on the type of project. Determining qualifications for these aircraft is an ongoing process,\u201d according to an FAA spokesperson.  Electric aviation proponents predict Alice and electric planes like it becoming as commonplace as any other means of transportation. \u201cIt really integrates aviation into the fabric of transportation, of our commuter life. It does so while being sustainable, and through being economically viable,\u201d said Bar-Yohay. \u201cOnce we start seeing planes like this, the entire way we look at where we live, how we commute, how we go on vacation, will change. It will be a high-speed train without the rail.\u201d  But electric aircraft big enough to rival large passenger jets may still be a ways off. \u201cThe first step would be to try these in a commuter market or charter market,\u201d said Aimer. \u201cThen eventually, if that works well, you\u2019re going to have passenger jets. For that we need Boeing or Airbus to come out with a actual electric airplane. I would see that in about 10 years.\u201d",

            "text": "The United Aviate Academy officially opened Thursday outside Phoenix, putting the school\u2019s first class of about 60 students on a streamlined path to a new career.   \u201cI am very excited for it,\u201d student pilot Adela Gallegos told CNN. The 23-year-old studied business administration in college and had no previous flying experience up until last month. \u201cBecause I just started thinking of it in the last year \u2014 this career has changed the way I\u2019ve seen how my entire life is going to go.\u201d   United says its in-house flight training operation is the first for any major airline in the United States. Consulting firm Oliver Wyman says airlines worldwide need an estimated 34,000 new pilots by 2025 to meet growing demand and keep up with retirements, and United CEO Scott Kirby said the traditional models are not adequately feeding the demand.   \u201cThe pilot shortage is real, but it\u2019s really real at the regional airlines,\u201d Kirby told CNN. \u201cIf it\u2019s a crisis, it\u2019s a crisis for small communities.\u201d    Traditionally, airlines looked to the military to provide a steady stream of qualified candidates. Civilian pilots had to come to the table with thousands of flying hours cobbled together on their own \u2014 the Federal Aviation Administration requires a minimum of 1,500 hours of piloting experience to earn an Airline Transport Pilot certificate. \u201cThis is the model really about creating that economic opportunity to let people come in who don\u2019t have $100,000 to spend on their certification, but have great potential, great ability \u2014 to let them get through the whole process of becoming a commercial airline pilot,\u201d Kirby said.  United says its academy costs $71,250, with scholarships available. Delta Air Lines recently dropped its requirement that pilot applicants have a four-year college degree, too. While the industry average pay for pilots is more than $190,000, according to the Labor Department, entry-level pay is notoriously low and training costs are high, frequently exceeding the limits of federal student loans. A 2018 report by the Government Accountability Office found cost to be one of the largest recruitment challenges for flight schools.  Airlines that cut costs by asking veteran flight crews to take early retirement packages during the depths of the pandemic are now staffing up. American Airlines wants to hire 2,000 pilots this year. Delta anticipates adding between 100 and 200 pilots to its ranks each month this year. United expects to train 500 pilots through the Aviate Academy every year over the decade. The aggressive hiring puts pressure on the regional airlines, which operate smaller planes branded United Express, American Eagle, and Delta Connection that also serve as career feeders to the mainline carriers.   Faye Malarkey Black, president and CEO of the Regional Airline Association, said the shortage is a top priority for her members.  \u201cThis is a problem that\u2019s real, it\u2019s present, it\u2019s already affected air service and it\u2019s going to get worse if we don\u2019t intervene now and give people a real path into this career,\u201d she said.   The problem, industry officials say, materializes in several ways. There are fewer pilots on standby when unexpected weather delays push a team into federal on-duty time limits. Several airlines canceled flights when crewmembers called out sick with the coronavirus. Those issues led airlines to cancel more than 18,800 flights around the Christmas and New Year\u2019s holidays.   In some places, Black said, \u201csmall communities are losing air service\u201d when airlines decide where to \u2013 and not to \u2013 fly.  \u201cThis is a real problem where the career path has effectively been reserved for the wealthy and if we want to fix the pilot shortage, if we want to bring more diversity to this population, we\u2019ve got to fix that,\u201d she said. Changing the faces in the cockpit Piloting was not Gallegos\u2019 dream career growing up.   But there also are not many pilots who look like her. About 94% of the field is white men, according to the Air Line Pilots Association, citing Bureau of Labor Statistics data.   \u201cEven though my grandpa was a fighter pilot, I never even considered a civilian woman could be a pilot,\u201d Gallegos said, a story she wrote in an essay that won her a training scholarship from the Latino Pilots Association. \u201cWe definitely need more people of color \u2014 more women in the industry.\u201d  In United\u2019s inaugural Aviate Academy class, 80% are women or non-white \u2014 disproportionate to United\u2019s current pilot corps of which only 19% are not white men. \u201cOur class is super diverse,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have everyone from all different backgrounds \u2013 people from all over the world and it\u2019s really cool to hear everyone\u2019s stories.\u201d   The first step is the 10-month Aviate academy, where students graduate with multiple credentials. The dormitory is on campus near the Cirrus SR-20 single-engine planes the students fly.     Kirby, the United CEO, said the training draws from the programs military pilots complete.   \u201cWe\u2019re going to give all these students Upset Recovery Training,\u201d he said.  \u201cFor example, where they\u2019ll be thrown into stalls and airplanes that flipped upside down and learn to recover \u2013 the kind of training that normally you get in a simulator, but [they\u2019re] doing it in the skies.\u201d After graduation, United points trainees toward jobs at partner companies, such as flight schools, where they can build the necessary hours. Then participants fly regional jets for a United partner, and two years later, have top priority to be a first officer, or co-pilot, at United.   Marcel Kimbrel, an instructor at the Aviate academy, said becoming a pilot was a career change.   \u201cI started my career in aviation as a flight attendant 16 years ago with United,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a pilot ever since I was a little kid.\u201d   \u201cIf I can do it, you can too,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really just have to step out of there and really take a chance on your dreams.\u201d",

ElonJet has over 150,000 followers, and uses a bot that Sweeney developed to monitor Musk\u2019s flights. The feed then tweets out when and where the plane takes off or lands and the duration of each trip.  The college freshman has developed about a dozen other flight bot accounts that track the travels of high-profile tech titans, including Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos.    The initial direct message from Musk came November 30, Protocol first reported. \u201cCan you take this down?,\u201d Musk asked Sweeney. \u201cIt\u2019s a security risk.\u201d  The Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) and SpaceX CEO eventually offered the teenager $5,000 to help prevent \u201ccrazy people\u201d from tracking his flights.

Musk has not yet responded.   CNN has reached out to SpaceX for comment.  Sweeney said he\u2019s been a fan of SpaceX since the first Falcon Heavy launch in 2018. His father works for an airline, fueling his interest in aviation. \u201c5,000 is not enough for how much I get out of it,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t replace anything, like the enjoyment factor.\u201d Sweeney did offer Musk some technical advice, telling the billionaire about a blocking program he could use to counter flight tracking programs. \u201cIt looks like he took that advice,\u201d Sweeney said, saying it appears Musk is currently using the blocking program. So is Sweeney is still able to track Musk\u2019s flights despite the blocking program? \u201cI am,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bit more complicated.\u201d",

            "text": "Yohannes and Gebremeskel knew it would be freezing cold inside the bulk cargo area of the Airbus A350 plane on the long flight from Ethiopia\u2019s capital to Belgium.    But the two ground technicians with Ethiopian Airlines, both of Tigrayan origin, said they felt a threat from the Ethiopian authorities that left them no choice but to stow away among crates of fresh flowers.    Both men said family members had been detained under sweeping emergency laws that have targeted ethnic Tigrayans \u2013 and that they feared it was their turn next. The laws were imposed in November as Ethiopian government troops battle forces from the northern Tigray region in a bitter conflict that has now dragged on for 14 months. The government denies the laws targeted any particular group and recently lifted the state of emergency.   So, in the early hours of December 4, Yohannes and Gebremeskel, both 25, made a spur of the moment decision to climb into the storage section of a converted Ethiopian Airlines cargo plane that was sitting in one of the hangars at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, waiting for the early morning flight to Brussels, Belgium.  As ground technicians with Ethiopia\u2019s flagship commercial airline for the past five years, they had access to the compartment for routine inspection purposes. But if their hiding place was discovered, they would face harsh punishment, they said. CNN has changed both men\u2019s names at their request for security reasons.    For more than three hours before take-off, they hid in the cold among the cabin crew\u2019s luggage, not far away from the plane\u2019s cargo shipment \u2013 crates loaded with roses ready to be delivered to Europe.\u202f    \u201cWe took the risk. We were \u2013 we had no choice, we had no choice, we couldn\u2019t live in Addis Ababa, we were being treated as terrorists,\u201d Yohannes, who has now obtained asylum in Belgium, told CNN in one of several phone conversations.\u202f\u202f    Four of his relatives have been killed, his fianc\u00e9e is in prison in Ethiopia\u2019s Afar region and his sister, about seven months pregnant, was seized from his house along with his furniture, he said. Yohannes believes these killings and detentions were motivated by their Tigrayan ethnicity and actioned under Ethiopia\u2019s new emergency laws. \u201cI don\u2019t know where she [his fianc\u00e9e] is currently,\u201d he added. CNN has not been able to independently verify the deaths or imprisonment of Yohannes\u2019 relatives. \u202f   A spokeswoman for the office of Ethiopia\u2019s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed noted in an emailed statement to CNN that the state of emergency was lifted on January 26, 2022.   \u201cYou would note that the Council of Ministers have today decided to lift the State of Emergency. Individuals apprehended under the SOE [State of Emergency] have been released in great numbers, over the past weeks by the security sector, following investigations,\u201d spokeswoman Billene Seyoum Woldeyes said.  \u201cThe SOE was never enacted to \u2018persecute\u2019 any group of people based on their identity,\u201d she said.  The pair are not the only airline employees to attempt a risky escape from their home country in recent weeks. On December 1, shortly before Yohannes and Gebremeskel fled to Belgium, two other Ethiopian Airlines technicians concealed themselves in a passenger aircraft destined for Washington, DC, a spokesperson for the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) confirmed to CNN via an emailed statement.   They had concealed themselves in the ceiling space above the seating, according to a source at Ethiopian Airlines with firsthand knowledge of the internal investigation that was launched afterward.  Their journey would last more than 36 hours in total, as the plane flew from Addis Ababa via Lagos, Nigeria, and Dublin, Ireland, before finally landing at Dulles International Airport in Washington, DC.   Upon arrival in the US, the individuals were detained by the US Department of Homeland Security before later being transferred to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP).   CNN has also spoken to several other Tigrayan employees of Ethiopian Airlines who have fled Ethiopia in recent months through their jobs as flight crew. They told similar stories of widespread detentions of Tigrayans in Ethiopia and of targeted ethnic harassment from within the airline.       Concealed above plane crew\u2019s bunk    CNN has been unable to speak directly to the stowaways who reached Washington, DC, but the source at Ethiopian Airlines said that both men were also of Tigrayan origin.    A CBP spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that after an identification and security examination, officers discovered the two \u201cpossessed Ethiopian Airlines employee identification cards, and that they stowed away with the intent of claiming asylum in the United States.\u201d    \u201cThe two Ethiopian males are presently housed at a federal detention facility pending a hearing before an immigration judge,\u201d the statement added. \u201cCBP issued a civil penalty to Ethiopian Airlines for the security breach and were briefed on measures the airline is undertaking to enhance the airline\u2019s aircraft security plan.\u201d    CNN has obtained photos of the inside of the Boeing 777 aircraft as it looked during an inspection in the aftermath of the escape. In some pictures, it is possible to see the crew bunk in the center of the plane\u2019s seating area, which the two men reportedly entered before lifting a mattress to reveal a maintenance access panel.\u202f     The images indicate they then cut a larger hole in the panel to enable them to smuggle themselves through the gap into the plane\u2019s ceiling. They hid in this spot, not far above the aircraft\u2019s toilets, for over a day and a half. CNN showed Boeing the photographs and a Boeing representative deferred to Ethiopian Airlines for comment.    The source at the airline told CNN they believed the fact that the stowaways were former maintenance technicians for the airline enabled them to know exactly where to hide inside the plane to go undetected without damaging the structure of the aircraft.\u202f    That they had the necessary tools with them to cut through the panelling might suggest the pair had planned the attempt in advance, the source at the airline added.    In total, 16 Ethiopian Airlines technicians appeared to have escaped via any possible means, either by boarding as cabin crew and walking off or stowing away, he said. CNN has been unable to independently verify this number.   For Yohannes and Gebremeskel, the decision to flee was an impromptu one, they said. They picked the first scheduled flight to a European country that was available and had to leave possessions including their cell phones behind in their lockers.\u202f   For the whole of their seven-hour flight to Brussels, they sat in the cargo area of the Airbus A350 with no food, no water, in the freezing cold, unbeknownst to the other members of the crew on board.\u202f\u202f    \u201cI didn\u2019t even have any clothes with me, I was wearing the uniform for maintenance [\u2026] I\u2019m still wearing it,\u201d Yohannes said.\u202f\u202f    \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to change into here, no underwear, no shoes, even the shoes [\u2026] we tried to cover our feet and the legs with what we had, it was night shift, on night shift we have the jacket of Ethiopian Airlines crew,\u201d Gebremeskel, who also obtained asylum in Belgium, told CNN.   It was not how Gebremeskel imagined he would experience his first trip out of Ethiopia. Despite working for five years at Ethiopian Airlines, he had never boarded an international flight.\u202f    Airline employees claim discrimination against Tigrayans  Many people have left Ethiopia by land since the conflict began in November 2020. As of mid-December 2021, more than 50,000 people had fled into neighboring Sudan, according to UN figures. At the peak of the influx, \u201cmore than 1,000 people on average were arriving each day, overwhelming the capacity to provide aid,\u201d a UN report said.       Meanwhile, attempts to leave Ethiopia by air by legal means have become increasingly difficult for Tigrayans, according to Ethiopian Airlines employees CNN spoke with.    Several attempted to leave by boarding planes from Addis Ababa\u2019s Bole Airport as legitimate passengers but were denied access due to their Tigrayan ethnicity, they claimed. One former employee told CNN there were four checkpoints at the airport where passengers had their passports checked before departure.\u202f\u202f   \u201cThey check place of birth and name,\u201d they told CNN, recalling three of their own failed attempts to leave. If the person was born in Tigray or had a Tigrayan name they were denied exit from Ethiopia, the former employee said.      As a result, several employees told CNN they escaped by working on board international flights as flight crew and fleeing when the aircraft landed abroad, often when the destination was in Europe or the US.     CNN has obtained IDs that confirm the identities of all four men who stowed away. Flight paths of the two flights \u2013 the one to Brussels and the one from Addis to Dulles airport through Dublin \u2013 have also been crosschecked on FlightRadar24.\u202f   Ethiopian Airlines has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment regarding the stowaways\u2019 journeys or the allegations of discrimination against Tigrayans.  This is not the first time Ethiopian Airlines has made headlines during the conflict in Ethiopia. In October last year CNN revealed that the airline had been ferrying weapons between Ethiopia and Eritrea at the outset of the conflict in November 2020, an act that was condemned by the international community as a potential violation of aviation law.   CNN\u2019s investigation triggered calls by US lawmakers for sanctions and investigations into Ethiopia\u2019s eligibility for a lucrative US trade program. Ethiopia was kicked out of the program over human rights violations at the start of 2022.    The airline has issued multiple denials about transporting weapons.\u202f      \u2018We were shaking\u2019    After the aircraft carrying Yohannes and Gebremeskel landed in Brussels, the two waited for their chance to reach the terminal building.\u202f\u202f    \u201cThere were two guys working on the aircraft. One was unloading the cargo shipment and the other was coming with a torch around the plane,\u201d Yohannes said. \u201cSo when the first was unloading the flowers we jumped to the ground \u2013 me and my friend \u2013 we jumped, and we ran to the terminal.\u201d\u202f\u202f    Inside, employees gave them water and something to eat, but Yohannes and Gebremeskel were still in shock. \u201cWe were afraid they were going to send us back [\u2026] The guards, they brought us tea, but we were kneeling down on the ground, we were shaking,\u201d Yohannes added.\u202f\u202f   Slowly, they felt a sense of relief, perhaps for the first time since they took off from Addis Ababa.   Their decision to flee had been prompted in part by reports that 38 Tigrayan security guards had been recently suspended at Bole Airport, meaning security was more lax than usual, they said.\u202f\u202f  But NISS, Ethiopia\u2019s national intelligence security service, was still searching every part of the aircraft before departure, Gebremeskel explained, in order to prevent escapes. The Ethiopian Prime Minister\u2019s spokesperson, Billene Seyoum, did not comment on these allegations.  Ethiopian Airlines has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at Bole Airport \u201cWe had some tools with us, we were afraid they were going to catch us because they check \u2013 the guy from the national intelligence security service checks every flight before departure,\u201d Gebremeskel said.\u202f\u202f    \u201cWe were afraid of course. We were sitting with some tools with us. Maybe they will come to check that we\u2019re working on it. Luckily, we were not found. If we had been found, the punishment would have been harsh.\u201d\u202f    Yohannes hopes that in Belgium, he will find a country that will \u201crespect my demands, the right to life.\u201d    Pieter-Jan De Block, their lawyer, confirmed in a statement to CNN that both his clients had \u201cobtained international protection in Belgium\u201d and that they\u2019d been released from the center where they were staying.\u202f   For Gebremeskel, the picture is bittersweet. With his family still far away \u2013 his parents are in a refugee camp in Sudan \u2013 and no money or job in Belgium, life is not easy. Although he has accommodation now, his first two nights after being granted asylum were spent sleeping at a train station.    He told CNN he hoped one day to return to Ethiopia but that until the country is a place where \u201cpeople aren\u2019t treated differently for their ethnicity,\u201d that hope feels very remote.

And speculative meme stocks like GameStop and AMC have been crushed.  But that\u2019s not causing Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Warren Buffett to lose any sleep.  Banks, energy firms and other value stocks have rallied this year, which is great news for Buffett since the Oracle of Omaha\u2019s conglomerate invests in many of these companies. Value stocks typically have lower price-to-earnings ratios, and they\u2019re definitely not trendy. Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKB) shares are up about 3% this year and near an all-time high, while all the FAANGs, Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT) and Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) are deeply in the red.

Berkshire\u2019s portfolio has also gotten a boost from Chevron\n            \n                (CVX), which is Buffett\u2019s twelfth-largest holding. The oil giant\u2019s shares are up 10% this year, making it the top performer in the Dow. If this keeps up, Dave Portnoy of media company Barstool Sports, who has positioned himself as an investing guru for a new generation of traders, will have to eat these words from a June 2020 tweet: \u201cI\u2019m sure Warren Buffett is a great guy but when it comes to stocks he\u2019s washed up. I\u2019m the captain now.\u201d It\u2019s too soon to say whether the current market trends will hold. But value investors who showed patience are looking pretty good so far in 2022. \u201cBuffett\u2019s the tortoise. Value investors just plod along,\u201d said John Buckingham, a value stock fund portfolio manager at Kovitz. \u201cYes, the Portnoys and Cathie Woods will have their day. But so many view investing as a casino. The key is to be patient and accept volatility.\u201d Sure, the 91-year-old Buffett\u2019s biggest holding is Apple\n            \n                (AAPL). which is down 5% so far in 2022 but just reported stellar earnings and strong iPhone sales. Berkshire even has a tiny stake in Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN), which has fallen 15%. So Berkshire hasn\u2019t avoided the Nasdaq meltdown entirely. But Berkshire doesn\u2019t own Facebook\n            \n                (FB) parent Meta, Netflix or Google\n            \n                (GOOGL) owner Alphabet. It also doesn\u2019t invest in Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT), due to Buffett\u2019s friendship with Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates. Berkshire does not have a stake in Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA), but it has invested in Chinese electric car firm BYD\n            \n                (BYDDF). Berkshire isn\u2019t just an investing firm. It owns well-known companies ranging from battery maker Duracell and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad to Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom and paint seller Benjamin Moore. However, Berkshire is primarily a financial services firm thanks to the fact that it owns insurance giant Geico and several other companies in the industry.  Berkshire has also benefited from the fact that investors have flocked to financial stocks due to expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon start raising interest rates. Berkshire is the largest holding in the Financial Select Sector SPDR\n            \n                (XLF) exchange-trade fund. \u201cWhen investors gravitate towards value they will buy financial stocks and Buffett will get his share,\u201d Buckingham said. \u201cBerkshire is benefiting because higher interest rates help Buffett\u2019s insurance business.\u201d  All eyes on the BoE and ECB Speaking of rates, the Fed has strongly suggested that a hike is coming in March. Investors will be watching the January jobs report on Friday for wage growth and inflation data, which could impact future Fed decisions. Some central banks have already hiked rates to combat rising inflation. The Bank of England, which increased rates from zero in December, is widely expected to raise them again at its next meeting on Thursday. Nearly two-thirds of the economists surveyed by Reuters are predicting that the central bank will boost rates another quarter of a percentage point, to 0.5%.  Many central banks in developed economies are expected to follow suit and start hiking rates later this year. \u201cThey are all going to move gradually if they can. Central banks don\u2019t need to be overly aggressive. It can be systematic,\u201d said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist with Ameriprise Financial. The one likely exception to the rule? The European Central Bank. The ECB also meets Thursday and is unlikely to raise rates. Its key refinancing rate is likely to remain at zero and will probably stay there for the foreseeable future.  ECB President Christine Lagarde is arguably the most dovish of the major central bank chiefs around the globe. She has argued that the ECB is unlikely to raise rates at any point in 2022 as the Covid pandemic remains a major economic challenge. \u201cThe ECB will want to allow for more time before rate hikes,\u201d Saglimbene said. \u201cGrowth is slower.\u201d  Saglimbene noted that southern European countries still need super-low rates to boost their economies while EU powerhouse Germany is being impacted by a slower global trade and manufacturing environment.

Airbus is chartering its much-loved Beluga XL plane, and a robot vacuum cleaner escaped from a UK hotel. Here\u2019s the latest news from CNN Travel this week. Cases rise but curbs relax With new Covid cases hitting a global record and 15 more places added to the CDC\u2019s highest-risk travel category, you might think travel rules would be tightening up again.  But that\u2019s not the case in Europe, where despite \u201cvery high\u201d risk designations, the European Union is advising its countries\u2019 governments to allow vaccinated citizens test-free travel around the region starting February 1. The United Kingdom is also relaxing restrictions for jabbed travelers on February 11.  Is the pandemic\u2019s end in sight? Maybe. In the meantime, here\u2019s how to think about planning travel right now. Life in Asia After battening down the hatches for Omicron, Bangkok will be reopening to tourists in February; here\u2019s what it\u2019s like to visit the Thai capital now. And in Bhutan, an ancient trail is set to reopen this spring for the first time in 60 years.  Hong Kong\u2019s Covid quarantine measures have been famously strict throughout the pandemic. This first-person account goes inside a 21-day stay at a government camp.  Hong Kong\u2019s zero-tolerance Covid rules are affecting animals, too. The city\u2019s animal owners are resorting to private jets when they need to relocate their pets.  Flying yachts, cars and whales A flying car has been cleared for takeoff in Slovakia, but you need a pilot\u2019s license to drive it. And a new Italian superyacht concept has the ability to sail high in the air as well as ride the waves.  The superyacht\u2019s helium-filled blimps could have been useful earlier this month when a huge 262-foot (80-meter) boat squeezed under a Dutch bridge with just a few inches of clearance.  Meanwhile, normally sea-bound beasts are likely to become a more common sight in the sky, as Airbus is set to charter its much-loved Beluga XL \u201cwhale plane.\u201d  Mayhem, misadventure and moolah A female tourist was thrown out of Venice for posing topless on a war memorial, while in England a robot vacuum cleaner was reported to have escaped from a budget hotel and was still at large the next day.  A cruise ship had an arrest warrant waiting in Miami. So it took passengers to the Bahamas instead. A German passenger who was traveling to Thailand with more than \u20ac33,000 in cash lost his money en route but was reunited with his stash by police on his return through Dubai International Airport, reports UAE\u2019s The National.  Sky and sea \u201cFlights to nowhere\u201d were a mini aviation trend in 2020 and 2021, as airlines dealt with pandemic restrictions on the ground by offering round-trip sightseeing adventures in the sky. We look at what\u2019s next for this quirky trend.  Martyn Griffiths of industry body Cruise Lines International Association told CNN Travel in June 2021 that cruise ships were \u201cone of the safest vacation environments available today.\u201d But as the highly transmissible Omicron spreads around the world and more reports come through of cruises canceled or turned around in the middle of voyages, the short-term future of smooth sailing is looking uncertain.  \u2018Travel was always priority number one\u2019 Kris Sokolowski, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2021, tells CNN Travel why exploring the world with his loved ones is his focus.

            "title": "The US is starting to make a manufacturing comeback. Here\u2019s how to sustain it",
            "text": "The Covid-19 pandemic has laid bare the vulnerabilities in America\u2019s domestic manufacturing base. The nation\u2019s reliance on globally fragmented supply chains has led to shortages of everything from personal protective equipment to semiconductors to shipping containers. And these supply weaknesses have been a primary driver of elevated price increases.  In fact, one-third of the price increases in 2021 were due to higher vehicle-related prices, as global computer chip shortages constrained automakers\u2019 ability to keep up with vehicle demand. Thankfully, though, American companies are starting to make positive moves. Intel recently announced it is creating a new $20 billion semiconductor manufacturing complex in Ohio. And General Motors just announced the company\u2019s all-time largest investment, which will strengthen its ability to manufacture batteries and electric trucks. These announcements were more than just good news on jobs and supply. They marked a significant milestone in our nation\u2019s economic and industrial renewal. We need to sustain this momentum, and that means enacting legislation to put historic levels of funding behind strengthening our supply chains, accelerating research and development in critical technologies, rebuilding manufacturing capabilities across America, and driving greater equity in STEM research and education. Last year, the Senate passed its version with the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), with broad bipartisan majorities, and this week, the House introduced its version with the America COMPETES Act. Getting a final version of this legislation to the President\u2019s desk will not only bolster our economic and national security, it will give cities and towns across America the sense of dignity and pride that comes from being part of an American manufacturing comeback.  This comeback is long overdue. Sixty years ago, federal investments in basic research and deployment enabled new semiconductor technology to reach commercial viability. After this public-private effort invented the technology, the US private sector led in manufacturing, producing nearly 40% of global production into the early 1990s.   However, because of decades of underinvestment and a lack of prioritization of supply chain resilience by both the public and private sector, the US lost that edge. Last year, America\u2019s share of global computer chip production was down to 12%. Equally worrying, our country produced none of the more advanced, leading-edge chips, while over 90% of them were produced in Taiwan.     This erosion creates serious national and economic security concerns, at a moment where our reliance on these chips is increasing. Demand for semiconductors was 17% higher in 2021 than 2019. By 2030, more than 20%  of the components going into a car will be semiconductors, as the industry shifts to electric and connected vehicles \u2014 a five-fold increase from 2019.  These concerns fueled President Biden\u2019s efforts to create a strategy to strengthen our manufacturing base. One month into office, he signed an executive order directing agencies to fortify our nation\u2019s critical supply chains, including focused attention on semiconductors, advanced battery technologies and critical minerals. In June, he released a 100-day report outlining a strategy to address critical vulnerabilities, such as China\u2019s 55% control of the world\u2019s capacity for mining rare earth minerals. And the President convened business, labor, international allies and members of Congress from both parties to generate stronger coordination, transparency and strategic domestic investment. The result has been an historic recovery for the manufacturing sector. US firms created 349,000 new manufacturing jobs in 2021 \u2014 the most in nearly 30 years. Businesses have committed nearly $80 billion in domestic semiconductor investments, alongside tens of billions in new investments \u2014 from new solar panel factories to advanced battery plants. With planned investments like these, our economy is positioned to sustain robust growth in our domestic manufacturing sector into the years ahead. However, this won\u2019t happen without a committed, domestic investment strategy for industrial resilience. That\u2019s why Congress must pass competition legislation to catalyze investment in critical technologies, like semiconductors, and bolster our domestic research and development infrastructure to foster innovation hubs in regions across the country.

            "text": "Size, energy efficiency, cargo and passenger load, comfort and cost. There are a lot of factors involved in making an airplane design appealing to airlines and, in turn, their customers.  But which are the best-selling civil airplanes of all time, and what made them stand out from the rest? Let\u2019s take a look at the top eight,  based on total deliveries as of December 31, 2021.  8. Airbus A330 In production: 1992 to present Deliveries so far: 1,527 The wide-body A330 went into service 28 years ago this month, and was conceived by its European manufacturer Airbus as a successor to the A300 \u2013 the world\u2019s first twin-engine wide-body plane.  The 63.66-meter long A330-300 was the first variant, with capacity for up to 440 passengers, and a versatility that meant it was suitable for both short-haul trips and long-range distances of up to 6,350 nautical miles.  It was followed by the smaller-scale A330-200, and then later the two \u201cneo\u201d craft, the A330-800 and A339-900, both with revolutionary curved wingtips.

Boeing 747 In production: 1968 to present Deliveries so far: 1,527 Affectionately known as \u201cQueen of the Skies,\u201d the four-engine 747 was the first wide-body plane and the original \u201cjumbo jet.\u201d  It entered service in 1970 with legendary airline Pan Am and soon became synonymous with the glamorous age of international travel. Since 1990, it\u2019s been the US presidential choice, with the Air Force One fleet comprising two customized 747-200Bs.  In recent years, many airlines have been replacing their passenger 747s with bigger, more efficient twin-engine planes.  Boeing expects to deliver the last ever jumbo \u2013 747-8 Freighter \u2013 to customer Atlas Air later this year.  Read more: Five ways Boeing\u2019s 747 jumbo jet changed travel  6. Boeing 777 In production: 1993 to present Deliveries so far: 1,677 The twin-engined \u201cTriple Seven\u201d isn\u2019t as humungous as the Queen of the Skies, but at nearly 64 meters in length the long-range wide-body is still longer than seven telephone poles laid end to end and can accommodate 440 passengers.  It was the first jetliner to be wholly designed by computer and the first Boeing aircraft to have weight-saving, computer-operated \u201cfly-by-wire\u201d controls. It\u2019s now a growing family of eight variants, with the extra-large 777X aircraft \u2013 the 777-8 and 777-9 \u2013 the newest additions. The much-delayed 777X-9 is projected to enter service in 2024 while production of the 777X-8 has yet to begin.  5. Boeing 727 Read more: Boeing\u2019s huge 777-9X airplane takes its first flight In production: 1962 to 1984 Deliveries: 1,832 This mid-sized plane, with a T-shaped tail and three rear-mounted engines, had range for transoceanic flights but was also versatile enough to land on short runways at smaller airports.  Boeing\u2019s original plan was to build just 250 of the craft, but it would go on to be the first commercial airplane to reach the 1,000-sales milestone.  In one of aviation\u2019s greatest unsolved mysteries, in 1971 a man known as D.B. Cooper hijacked a 727 in the northwest United States before parachuting to the ground with $200,000 of stolen cash strapped to his body.  The audacious escape was only possible because an early design quirk of the 727 meant that the rear door could be opened mid-flight.

Bombardier CRJ In production: 1991 to 2020 Deliveries: 1,945 Regional jets are smaller planes, usually with fewer than 100 seats, that are designed for short-haul routes. The Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet family is the best-selling of its kind.  Canadian manufacturer Bombardier launched the program with the 50-seat CRJ, which was certified in 1992, before expanding with the 70-seat CRJ700 in 1997, the 86-seat CRJ900 in 2000 and the 100-seat CRJ1000 in 2007.  The last of the popular short-hop jets was delivered to Utah-based SkyWest Airlines in February 2021.  Read more: How a beginner plane-spotter can ID commercial jets 3. Airbus A320 In production: 1986 to present Deliveries: 10,176 This is where the competition starts to get serious. Airbus delivered its 10,000th A320 last summer and, if we were basing this list on orders as well as deliveries, the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the 21st century\u2019s most popular plane back in 2019.  The first A320 entered service in March 1988 and the twin-engine single-aisle craft has clocked up more than 280 million flight hours in the years since.  Variants include the A318, A319 and A321, while the A320neo family was introduced into service in 2016.  Read more: Airbus A320: A global, short-range single-aisle workhorse 2. Boeing 737 In production: 1968 to present Deliveries: 10,877  The Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320 are the aviation stalwarts that most of us will have flown in on many, many occasions.  The narrow-body classic has been traversing the skies for more than half a century, and the improved Next-Generation civilian version was produced from 1996 to 2019.  However, the much-publicized problems with the fourth-generation 737 MAX, which was involved in two fatal accidents in 2018 and 2019, have damaged Boeing\u2019s reputation and profits.  Read more: Boeing\u2019s 2021 was starting off pretty well \u2013 until its latest 737 MAX woes 1. Cessna 172 In production: 1968 to present Deliveries: 45,000 and counting While the 737 and A320 are the world\u2019s top passenger jetliners, the plucky little four-seater Cessna 172 is the most successful civil aircraft in history, with more than 45,000 of them reported to have been built.  Its primary use is as a training plane, and generation after generation of pilots have cut their teeth in them. The high wings on this single-engine craft give pilots better visibility, making it easier to get their bearings on the world around them and also to land.  The large cabin doors make it simple for trainees and instructor to hop in and out, meaning that this is a popular design classic that\u2019s endured.  ",

Weeks after ending output of the world\u2019s largest passenger jet, the A380, Airbus is planning a new role for what could be the West\u2019s largest commercial freighter by volume, the Beluga.    It is a rare example of aerospace \u201cinsourcing\u201d tasks from other industries after years of farming out work externally, and if successful could pave the way for other services. The 100% unit will work a commercial basis, Airbus said. \u201cIt will get its revenues from its sales, and it will bear all its investments and operating costs,\u201d a spokesman said. Analysts say demand for outsized cargoes that can be transported without dismantling them has been rising, partly on the back of weakened supply chains. Logistics managers turn to oversized airplanes when there is no time to use sea lanes.    Until recently, Airbus had trouble meeting such demand because the aerospace industry was running at peak capacity. But analysts say lower output of large passenger jets and an industry-wide slump during the pandemic have meant older Belugas have more time left on the clock than first expected. \u201cThe Beluga ST are only at 50% of their life. They have been designed for 30,000 flight cycles and currently have an average of 15,000,\u201d said Philippe Sabo, head of Airbus Transport International. A flight cycle is one take-off and landing. Airbus cut average output by 40% when the pandemic hit and plans to restore and slightly increase output of singe-aisle jets by summer 2023. But wide-body output is expected to remain around half levels foreseen when Beluga XL was launched in 2014. Airbus said there was no connection between the project to commercialize the Beluga fleet and planned production, however. ",

            "title": "Boeing posts massive charge for 787 Dreamliner problems, sending losses soaring",
            "text": "Boeing took nearly $4 billion in charges related to problems it had with its 787 Dreamliner, causing losses to soar for the third straight year. The company had already been hit with the problems surrounding the 737 Max, which was grounded for 20 months starting in 2019 following two fatal crashes. Demand then plunged for new aircraft because of massive airline losses caused by the pandemic.  Boeing has essentially been unable to deliver the widebody 787 jet for a year because of quality control issues. The company said it will have to pay $3.5 billion to compensate customers for the delayed deliveries. It delivered only 14 of the jets in 2021, and none since June. It also said the delays would increase the costs of producing the plane by an estimated $2 billion, with most of those costs coming at the end of this year. It booked $285 million of those increased costs in the just completed quarter. \u201cWe are progressing through a comprehensive effort to ensure every airplane in our production system conforms to our exacting specifications. This effort continues to impact our deliveries and our financial results \u2014 but we are fully confident it is the right thing to do,\u201d said Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun in a memo to employees Wednesday. \u201cWhile we never want to disappoint our customers or miss expectations, the work we\u2019re putting in now will build stability and predictability going forward.\u201d The charges caused the company to report a net loss of $4.3 billion for the year, which is actually an improvement from the $11.9 billion it lost in 2020. Its core loss, excluding special items, came to $4.1 billion for the year, reversing a narrow profit on that basis in the first nine months of 2021. It\u2019s a core quarterly loss on that basis of $4.5 billion. That was far worse than analysts had forecast. The quarterly results did include some good news for Boeing. The company had a positive cash flow for the first time since the first quarter of 2019, the period in which problems with the 737 Max started.  \u201cWe have been focused relentlessly on improving our free cash flow situation\u201d Calhoun told investors on a conference call Wednesday. \u201cIt has been our #1 metric. And to be able to achieve that, I think, is terrific news.\u201d  The Max grounding and the onset of the pandemic caused the company to burn through cash. The Max eventually cost Boeing more than $21 billion in documented costs and led to more than 1,000 canceled orders for the jets that sharply reduced its revenue. So problems with the 787 Dreamliner were the last thing the company needed. The delivery and quality issues are not the only headwinds for the plane.  Built with innovative lightweight carbon fiber instead of aluminum for much of its fuselage, the Dreamliner was designed mainly for long-haul international routes. But international travel is the sector of the airline industry expected to be the last to recover from the ongoing pandemic downturn. Orders for the jet fell to just 21 in 2021, down from 113 in 2019. \u201cWe are taking the time now to ensure we\u2019re positioned well as widebody demand recovers,\u201d said Calhoun in his memo to employees. Boeing\n            \n                (BA) shares fell nearly 4% in Wednesday morning trading on the results, even as broader US stock indexes rallied ahead a much anticipated meeting of the Federal Reserve. Company executives tried to assure investors Wednesday that in the scheme of things the problems with the 787 are temporary. \u201cWhile this hurts in the near term, we still believe it\u2019s the right thing to do because long term, we\u2019re going to sell a lot of these 787s for decades,\u201d said CFO Brian West. \u201cSo we\u2019ve just got to work our way through this.\u201d Several airlines have said they expect Boeing to begin deliveries of the 787 this spring, perhaps in April. But company executives repeatedly declined to give a target date for the deliveries, saying it was up to the Federal Aviation Administration. During the 737 Max grounding, the company repeatedly missed target dates for when it expected to gain approval for the plane to fly again. It\u2019s clear that Boeing does not want to repeat that mistake. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get ahead of anybody with respect to speculating the day we pick it,\u201d said Calhoun. \u201cThat\u2019s up to the FAA, and we\u2019re going to let them do what they have to do.\u201d ",

            "text": "The United States Navy is trying to retrieve its most advanced fighter jet from the depths of the South China Sea, an extremely complex operation that analysts say will be closely monitored by Beijing.  The F-35C, a single-engine stealth fighter and the newest jet in the US Navy fleet, crash-landed on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson during routine operations on Monday, the Navy said. The $100 million warplane impacted the flight deck of the 100,000-ton aircraft carrier and then fell into the sea as its pilot ejected, Navy officials said. The pilot and six sailors aboard the Vinson were injured. While damage to the Vinson was only superficial, and it and the carrier\u2019s air wing have resumed normal operations, the Navy faces the daunting task of attempting to pull the F-35 off the ocean floor in some of the most contested waters on the planet.  The Navy is giving scant details on its recovery plans for the F-35C, the first of which only became operational in 2019. \u201cThe US Navy is making recovery operations arrangements for the F-35C aircraft involved in the mishap aboard USS Carl Vinson\u201d is all a spokesman for the US 7th Fleet, Lt. Nicholas Lingo, would tell CNN on Wednesday. Though the Navy has not revealed where in the South China Sea the crash occurred, Beijing claims almost all of the 1.3 million square mile (3.3 million square kilometer) waterway as its territory and has bolstered its claims by building up and militarizing reefs and islands there. Chinese naval and coast guard vessels maintain a constant presence in South China Sea waters. The US disputes those Chinese territorial claims and uses deployments like the one the Vinson was on to push its case for a \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific.\u201d There has been no official Chinese comment on the crash, with state media reporting it only citing \u201cforeign media.\u201d But China will almost certainly want to get a look at the lost F-35, analysts said. \u201cChina will try to locate and survey it thoroughly using submarines and one of its deep diving submersibles,\u201d said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center in Hawaii. Schuster, a former US Navy captain, said it\u2019s possible China could make a claim for the salvage rights based on its territorial claims in the South China Sea. \u201cSalvaging the plane with commercial and coast guard assets will enable Beijing to claim it is recovering a potential environmental hazard or foreign military equipment from its territorial waters,\u201d Schuster said. But such an operation would present political risks, said Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. \u201cTo overtly go about doing this may risk worsening tensions with the US. I don\u2019t believe Beijing has stomach for that,\u201d he said.  \u201cHowever, we can expect the Chinese to shadow, hang around and keep tabs on any such American salvage and recovery operation,\u201d Koh said. Schuster said the US Navy will likely keep some presence in the area where the wreckage is believed to be in an operation that could take months, depending upon how deep under the South China Sea the F-35 is. US salvage vessels are 10 to 15 days transit time to the site, Schuster said, and recovery once there could take up to 120 days. Asked whether the US could just destroy the wreckage with a torpedo or an explosive charge, analysts said that was unlikely. \u201cMy question is whether you truly leave behind nothing of potentially consequential intelligence bonanza amongst the scattered smithereens on the seabed \u2013 which any interested party with the capability may still retrieve after all?\u201d Koh said. This US Navy recovery effort will mark the third time a country flying the F-35 has tried to pull one from the depths. Last November, a British F-35B crashed on takeoff from the deck of its aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth into the Mediterranean Sea. Britain\u2019s Defense Ministry confirmed to news outlets in early January that it had been recovered in December amid worries the sunken aircraft could have been a target for Russian intelligence. And after a Japanese F-35A crashed into the Pacific in 2019, worries emerged that it could be a target for Russian and Chinese intelligence.  But only small pieces of the Japanese aircraft were recovered by Japan as that plane is thought to have hit the water at full speed. In the case of the Mediterranean crash and this week\u2019s mishap, the planes were moving more slowly, so more of the wreckage is be expected to be found.",

            "text": "Some manufacturers that rely on semiconductors are down to less than five days\u2019 worth of inventory, according to a report released Tuesday by the Commerce Department, in the latest indication of the extent of the computer chip shortage. The report, based on more than 150 responses to a Commerce Department request for information from businesses that produce and use semiconductors, found that the median supply of chips held by manufacturers has dropped from 40 days\u2019 worth in 2019 to less than five days\u2019 worth last year. The limited supply means that disruptions to production overseas \u2014 such as those from weather or new Covid-19 outbreaks \u2014 could again lead to factory shutdowns and furloughed workers in the United States, according to the report. It notes that inventories are even smaller in \u201ckey industries.\u201d  \u201cThe semiconductor supply chain remains fragile,\u201d the report states. \u201cDemand continues to far outstrip supply.\u201d  A global supply crunch sparked by the pandemic and extreme weather in Asia has led to shortages and, in some cases, higher prices of cars, iPhones, washing machines and more \u2014 at a time when consumers have never been more reliant on tech devices. Last year, General Motors was forced to temporarily shutter production at most of its North American plants because of the chip shortage, and many other automakers slashed their production plans.  US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told CNN in December that the shortage is unlikely to go away until \u201cdeep into 2022.\u201d The Commerce Department\u2019s Tuesday report found that \u201crespondents did not see the problem going away in the next six months.\u201d The Biden administration has been working to prop up the US chip-making industry, both to ease current supply chain woes and reduce America\u2019s dependence on foreign production of the crucial components going forward.  The biggest bottleneck in the chip supply chain is capacity at semiconductor fabrication plants, called \u201cfabs,\u201d a problem that\u2019s not easily solved quickly. Still, some chipmakers have jumped to contribute. Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Global Foundries have all announced plans to invest billions of dollars on new plants, including multiple in the United States. Just last week, Intel announced plans to invest another $20 billion to build a chip manufacturing complex outside Columbus, Ohio.  President Biden has urged Congress to pass legislation to address global semiconductor shortages. Congress has passed the CHIPS for America Act, which includes $52 billion in subsidies to support domestic semiconductor manufacturing, but has not yet allocated the funds.  \u201cThis is about national security, economic security and it\u2019s about jobs,\u201d Biden said last week of the need to increase US chip production. In its report Tuesday, the Commerce Department said it had identified certain semiconductor products for which the supply challenges are most acute, including \u201clegacy logic chips\u201d used in cars, medical devices and other products, and \u201canalog chips\u201d used in image sensors. \u201cWe will target our efforts moving forward on collaborating with industry to resolve bottlenecks\u201d for those specific products, the report states. The report is likely to bolster those calling on Congress to direct resources to the industry. Jordan Crenshaw, vice president of the US Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Technology Engagement Center, said the findings on the ongoing shortage \u201chighlights the critical need for the United States to invest in expanding semiconductor capacity.\u201d \u201cCongress must get to work on fully implementing and funding the CHIPS Act,\u201d Crenshaw said in a statement.

            "text": "The pilot of a US F-35 jet ejected as his jet crashed on the deck of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier in the South China Sea, injuring seven, the US Pacific Fleet said in a statement Monday.  The pilot was conducting routine flight operations when the crash happened. They safely ejected and were recovered by a military helicopter, Pacific Fleet said. The pilot is in stable condition.  Six others were injured on the deck of the carrier. Three required evacuation to a medical facility in Manila, Philippines, where they are in stable condition, according to Pacific Fleet. The other three sailors were treated on the carrier and have been released. The cause of what the statement called a \u201cinflight mishap\u201d is under investigation. A spokesman for the Navy\u2019s 7th Fleet in Japan, Lt. Mark Langford, said Tuesday the impact to the Vinson\u2019s flight deck was \u201csuperficial\u201d and the warship and its air wing had resumed normal operations. As for the F-35, \u201cthe status of the recovery is in progress,\u201d Langford said. The crash is the first for an F-35C, the US Navy\u2019s variant of the single-engine stealth fighter, designed for operations off aircraft carriers. The F-35A, flown by the Air Force, takes off and lands on conventional runways, and the F-35B, the Marine Corps version, is a short-takeoff vertical landing aircraft that can operate off the Navy\u2019s amphibious assault ships. Versions of the F-35 are also flown by US allies and partners, including Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands and Israel. More countries have orders in for the jet. The US Navy variant \u201cfeatures more robust landing gear to handle carrier takeoffs and landings, folding wings to fit on a crowded flight deck, larger wings, a slightly larger payload, and a slightly longer operating range,\u201d according to the aircraft\u2019s manufacturer, Lockheed Martin. The F-35C was the last of the three variants to become operational, doing so in only 2019. Carl Vinson was the first of the US Navy\u2019s 11 aircraft carriers to deploy with the F-35C when it left San Diego last August. \u201cThis deployment marks the first time in U.S. naval aviation history that a stealth strike fighter has been deployed operationally on an aircraft carrier,\u201d Lockheed Martin said. The addition of the F-35C to Carrier Air Wing 2 aboard Carl Vinson for its current deployment marks the first time a US carrier has flown with what the Navy calls its \u201cair wing of the future,\u201d which also includes F/A-18E/F fighters, EA-18G electronic warfare aircraft, E-2D airborne early warning aircraft and CMV-22 tilt-rotor transports. Monday\u2019s crash in the South China Sea was the second of an F-35 this year. On January 4, the pilot of a South Korean F-35 made an emergency \u201cbelly landing\u201d at an air base on Tuesday after its landing gear malfunctioned due to electronic issues, according to the South Korean Air Force. In previous years, F-35s have been involved in at least eight other incidents, according to records kept by the crowdsourced website F-16.net. Last November, a British F-35B crashed into the Mediterranean Sea off the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth. The pilot ejected safely. In May 2020, the pilot ejected safely when a US Air Force F-35 crashed on landing at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. The Air Force attributed the crash to a variety of factors involving the pilot and the plane\u2019s systems. In April 2019, a Japanese F-35 crashed into the Pacific Ocean off northern Japan, killing its pilot. The Japanese military blamed that crash on spatial disorientation, \u201ca situation in which a pilot cannot sense correctly the position, attitude, altitude, or the motion of an airplane,\u201d according to the journal Military Medicine. When the latest crash occurred, Carl Vinson and its escorts were operating in the South China Sea along with the USS Abraham Lincoln Strike Group in dual-carrier operations that began on Sunday, according to Navy social media accounts. The 1.3 million-square-mile South China Sea has been the site of frequent naval activity in the past several years as China has asserted its claims over almost all of the area by building up and militarizing islands and reefs. The US military asserts its right to operate freely in what are international waters. Carrier deployments like the current one exercise those rights.  The two strike groups along with a Japanese helicopter destroyer staged a large exercise on Saturday in the Philippine Sea, the part of the Pacific Ocean between Taiwan and the US island territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. A day after that exercise, China sent 39 warplanes into Taiwan\u2019s self-declared air defense identification zone, the largest such incursion of Chinese warplanes into that zone this year. This story has been updated with additional details.",

            "text": "Potentially abysmal air travel interruptions were narrowly avoided this week when wireless carriers made a last-minute change to their planned 5G rollout in response to fears that new cell service towers could interfere with a key component on passenger jets that allows them to safely land in low visibility conditions. Warnings of mass flight cancellations came as AT&T, Verizon and the airline industry hashed out a deal to delay 5G deployment around major airports. And on Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration cleared a greater number of commercial airliners to fly in the situations where pilots consider possible 5G interference to be the most dangerous. Now, nearly 80% of the United States\u2019 entire commercial airliner fleet has that clearance. In the end, crisis seemed to be mostly averted. No planes fell out of the sky. And \u2014 with a few exceptions \u2014 air travel stayed mostly on schedule.  But we\u2019re not in the clear yet. The agreement to delay 5G deployment around airports is only a temporary fix, and it\u2019s not clear if all the negotiating parties have a specific deadline they\u2019re working toward. A significant number of planes still haven\u2019t been cleared to land in those most dangerous situations. Regional air carriers have been crying out that they\u2019ve been left out of discussions and are still facing long- and short-term impacts. And, to the public\u2019s knowledge, a permanent solution to the issue still hasn\u2019t been settled on.  Here\u2019s everything we do \u2014 and don\u2019t \u2014 know about the situation. What\u2019s the deal with the FAA \u2018clearing\u2019 some planes but not others? Radar altimeters are devices that uses radio waves to gauge how far an aircraft is off the ground, and they\u2019re essential for commercial airliners to land in bad weather. At the root of the ongoing problem is the fact that 5G frequencies Verizon and AT&T have just deployed, known as the C-band, are very near to the frequencies used by radar altimeters, sparking concerns about interference. Over the past two weeks, radar altimeter manufacturers have scrambled to \u201cevaluate data from the wireless companies to determine how robust each model\u201d of radar altimeter is and whether it can still function even when flying near an active 5G antenna, according to the FAA. In a statement Thursday, the FAA said it issued more approvals that allow 78% of the US commercial airliner fleet to perform low-visibility landings at airports near where wireless companies deployed 5G. Essentially, regulators said that they now deemed it safe for aircraft that used one of 13 types of radar altimeters. The approved models include: But of course, more than 20% of the United States\u2019 commercial aircraft fleet hasn\u2019t been approved. And the FAA warned that it anticipates that \u201csome altimeters will be too susceptible to 5G interference.\u201d  \u201cTo preserve safety, aircraft with those altimeters will be prohibited from performing low-visibility landings where 5G is deployed because the altimeter could provide inaccurate information,\u201d the agency said.  The agency also warned that the buffers that are reducing 5G signal strength around certain airports are essential for keeping safe operations going. It is not clear, however, why the FAA and altimeter manufacturers could not have done these evaluations sooner.  On its website, the FAA states that over the past two weeks it has \u201creceived vital 5G\u201d data that made these decisions possible and \u201cfacilitated data sharing\u201d between altimeter manufacturers and wireless companies. What\u2019s the deal with regional carriers? They\u2019re still in limbo, according to Faye Malarkey Black, who as Regional Airline Association president represents the carriers connecting larger hubs to dozens of smaller cities around the country.    Regional flights have brands like American Eagle, Delta Connection, and United Express, and they\u2019re contracted out to companies or subsidiaries like Envoy, ExpressJet, Republic Airways and SkyWest Airlines.  And for them \u2014 \u201ccrisis has not been averted,\u201d Black warned.  Bombardier jets, which are frequently flown by regional carriers, haven\u2019t gotten the green light for their altimeters. And Black said the rural airports will still \u201ctake a big hit to [their] operation when weather rolls in.\u201d \u201cWe will never compromise on safety,\u201d Black wrote on Twitter. \u201cFlights will be grounded. Near term = highly disruptive. Long term =  small [communities] will have less choice & less service.\u201d How did we get here and who\u2019s to blame? We\u2019re not sure. The airline industry has known for years that 5G was coming. Part of the issue may be an ongoing power struggle between the FAA and the Federal Communications Commission, which is the United States\u2019 referee for all things radio spectrum-related and sold off the band of spectrum at issue to wireless companies for a whopping $80 billion last year. The FAA and FCC had been aware that airlines believed a travel disaster could be imminent if 5G were deployed without addressing the altimeter concerns. Wireless carriers had largely dismissed those concerns, however, and it wasn\u2019t until international airlines began canceling flights ahead of the 5G deployment on Wednesday that everyone began to announce significant strides in finding a solution.  And that\u2019s how we got to where we are now, with temporary buffer zones that prevent 5G from being deployed near certain airports \u2014 we don\u2019t know exactly which ones \u2014 and a massive scramble to hash out exactly how much the altimeters will be impacted by this new cell service. As far as who is to blame, Verizon and AT&T \u2014 which owns CNN parent company WarnerMedia \u2014 pinned much of the blame on the Federal Aviation Administration in statements on Tuesday.  But the FAA has been adamant that the aviation industry\u2019s concerns are real \u2014 and with the industry already reeling from the global pandemic \u2014 airlines are desperately hoping to avoid giving people yet another reason not to fly. Emirates president Sir Tim Clark did not mince words about what he sees as the issue, placing blame on the entire structure of the US system, saying \u201cthis is one of the most delinquent, utterly irresponsible\u201d situations that he\u2019s seen in his aviation career. He added that the \u201crisks and dangers\u201d should have already been evaluated.  How do we fix all this? It\u2019s not clear. Discussion among wireless carriers AT&T and Verizon as well as the airline industry and federal regulators are still ongoing.  We\u2019re not sure if or when they will publicly announce a definitive path forward, but decisions will have to be made, especially considering the 5G \u201cbuffer zones\u201d around major air hubs are still only temporary.  Tom Wheeler, who served as chair of the FCC from 2013 to 2017, wrote some suggestions in a November piece for The Brookings Institution, where he said the concerns over spectrum interference could be allayed by making adjustments to the altimeters themselves. The problem? That\u2019s likely to cost billions of dollars \u2014 billions that no corporation wants to take out of its own pockets. \u201cThere are only three sources of such funds for the aviation industry. The government could pay out of the almost $82 billion generated by the sale of licenses to use the [5G spectrum at issue]; that would probably require an act of Congress,\u201d Wheeler wrote. \u201cThe wireless industry could pay an additional tariff on top of the billions already spent for spectrum the government said would be ready for use on December 5. The aviation industry, having known for some time of the new 5G allocation, could pay to fix the offending altimeters.\u201d Wheeler, for his part, also placed much of the blame for this debacle on a lack of leadership and a lack of a national spectrum policy. What\u2019s next? We\u2019re still waiting for updates on the negotiations from the FAA, FCC and all the other involved parties. It\u2019s not clear if there is a firm deadline they\u2019re working toward, nor is it clear how long the \u201ctemporary\u201d 5G buffer zones will stay in place.",

            "text": "Airline executives breathed a sigh of relief to their investors Thursday, saying they believe the threat to their operations from the rollout of 5G technology is now behind them. Although AT&T and Verizon have agreed only to temporarily delay 5G deployment at major airports, the CEOs of American and United both said there will now be a resolution of the dispute without thousands of delayed, diverted or canceled flights. They had been predicting those dire consequences earlier this week. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a while to get to the right spot, but I feel like we\u2019re in the right spot,\u201d said Doug Parker, the CEO of American Airlines. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see any material disruption going forward because of this.\u201d \u201cWhile I wish it happened earlier, the good news is we now have everyone engaged, the FAA and DOT at the highest levels, the \u2026 aircraft manufacturers, airlines and the telecoms,\u201d said Scott Kirby, the United CEO. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t have a final resolution quite yet, I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll get there.\u201d The Federal Communications Commission auctioned off the C-band spectrum to US wireless carriers last year \u2014 an $81 billion sale that would allow them to provide robust \u2013 and lucrative \u2013 5G service. But the airlines soon started screaming that use of that technology near airports could interfere with aircraft radar altimeters, an instrument that tells pilots how high their plane is off the ground. Altimeters are crucial for landing airplanes in low-visibility conditions.  That could have meant widespread, continual and costly schedule disruptions \u2013 perhaps delaying tens of thousands of flights a year. It could have costs billions of dollars to the industry that has lost tens of billions in the last two years due to the pandemic. Canceled or delayed flights, no matter the cause, are costly. Just two weeks of disruptions during the recent holiday travel season caused by lack of staff due to Omicron cases and bad weather cost Delta $80 million. This had the potential to create schedule disruptions unlike anything seen in decades.  After a couple of temporary 5G service delays, the White House and the telecoms this week reached a deal to delay the rollout of the technology near airports until there can be a consensus on how to address the potential problem. The telecom companies sounded less than pleased with the truce. \u201cWe are frustrated by the FAA\u2019s inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services, and we urge it do so in a timely manner,\u201d AT&T spokesperson Megan Ketterer. CNN is owned by AT&T. But the airline executives voiced confidence there can be an agreement in short order that will satisfy all parties. \u201cThe technical experts that are working on it tell us it\u2019s really not that complicated once they all are able to share information and work on it,\u201d Parker said Thursday. \u201cSo they seem encouraged that we\u2019ll be able to address this in a way that allows for full deployment of 5G, including near airports. I don\u2019t expect until we get to the point that everyone is really comfortable that you\u2019ll see anything turned on near airports, because no one wants to go through this again.\u201d There are still some problems for regional airlines that fly smaller planes, including American Eagle, Delta Connection, and United Express. Faye Malarkey Black, president of the Regional Airline Association said her member are still waiting to see what rules will apply in cases of bad visibility for their flights. \u201cManufacturers for regional aircraft have submitted those same plans to the FAA,\u201d Black told CNN. \u201cThey have not heard word back. We don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll hear word back.\u201d But, after a number of international airlines US suspended flights because of 5G concerns, most of those flights have resumed.    A new problem is the last thing airlines needed The 5G had loomed large as the latest massive problem for an industry that has been dealing one massive problem after another for nearly two years of the pandemic. American, United and Delta alone have reported combined losses of $36.5 billion, excluding special items since the start of 2020. Southwest, which had gone 47 years without posting an annual loss, is about to report its second straight annual loss next week. But hope may be on the horizon for America\u2019s airlines. Despite the rise of Omicron, the airlines say bookings are for this year\u2019s spring break period and they remain hopeful for a strong summer. Most are projecting a return to profitability in 2022. Leisure domestic travel is almost back to pre-pandemic levels, even though business travel is still down from where it was before the pandemic. American said Thursday that small and medium business travel was roughly 80% of where it stood pre-pandemic, and travel by large corporate customers was still down 60%.  Still, the timing of the Omicron surge actually came at the best possible time for the airlines, despite the problems it caused during the holidays, said Philip Baggaley, chief airline credit analyst for Standard & Poor\u2019s. \u201cIt was bad it hit during the holidays because it mucked up operations,\u201d he said. \u201cBut because it involved holiday plans that had already been made, passengers plowed ahead. The demand was there.\u201d And January and February are historically the slowest time of the year for air travel, so the impact on bookings is limited, he said.  \u201cThe next six weeks were a lost cause anyhow,\u201d he noted. However Baggaley said there have been previous times during the pandemic that things looked like they were on the verge of a turnaround for airlines, only to have that slip through their fingers. \u201cI think the expectation for an upturn in bookings in the spring and summer and a return to profitability is a reasonable base case,\u201d said Baggaley. \u201cBut a lot of other things can happen.\u201d Among the worries for the airlines is another variant that again cuts into demand for air travel, further restrictions on international flights. They also face uncertainty about higher fuel costs, the second highest cost for airlines after wages and benefits. And they face higher labor costs as they prepare for negotiations with their unions, many of which have angry membership complaining they are at a breaking point after a most difficult two years. So the truce in the 5G battles is a relatively rare piece of good news for an airline industry which really didn\u2019t need any more bad news. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Pete Muntean and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report",

            "text": "The Federal Aviation Administration has cleared more commercial airliners \u2013 notably more smaller, regional jets \u2013 to fly in the situations where pilots consider possible 5G interference to be the most dangerous. In a new statement, the FAA says it has issued more approvals that allow 78% of the US commercial airliner fleet to perform low-visibility landings at airports near where wireless companies deployed 5G. Airlines said 5G towers set to go live nationwide on Wednesday could cause interference and errors in radar altimeters \u2013 instruments commercial pilots need to perform such landings \u2013 since they operate on a similar radio frequency.  Verizon and AT&T, which owns CNN\u2019s parent company, this week delayed the rollout at some airports while a permanent fix to prevent inference is in the works.  Airplane models with one of the 13 cleared altimeters include all Boeing 717, 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, 787, MD-10/-11 jets; all Airbus A300, A310, A319, A320, A330, A340, A350 and A380 models; and some Embraer 170 and 190 regional jets, the FAA said.  \u201cThe FAA is working diligently to determine which remaining altimeters are reliable and accurate where 5G is deployed in the United States,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe anticipate some altimeters will be too susceptible to 5G interference. To preserve safety, aircraft with those altimeters will be prohibited from performing low-visibility landings where 5G is deployed because the altimeter could provide inaccurate information.\u201d But a sizable and less visible portion of the aviation industry remains in limbo.   \u201cCrisis has not been averted,\u201d says Faye Malarkey Black, who as Regional Airline Association president represents the carriers connecting larger hubs to dozens of smaller cities around the country.    The flights have brands like American Eagle, Delta Connection, and United Express. The flights are contracted out to companies or subsidiaries like Envoy, ExpressJet, Republic Airways and SkyWest Airlines.   The Federal Aviation Administration has approved procedures for more than a dozen models of Boeing and Airbus planes to perform low-visibility landings at some airports where new 5G cell phone technology could interfere and throw off critical flight equipment. Verizon and AT&T, which owns CNN\u2019s parent company, this week delayed the rollout at some airports while a permanent fix to prevent inference is in the works. But the FAA\u2019s approvals do not cover many of the smaller planes flown by regional carriers, Black said.   \u201cManufacturers for regional aircraft have submitted those same plans to the FAA,\u201d Black told CNN. \u201cThey have not heard word back.  We don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll hear word back.\u201d   The FAA did not immediately comment on the matter.   One of the regional carriers, SkyWest, told CNN late Wednesday that it has \u201cnot received updates from the FAA on mitigations for our fleets.\u201d   \u201cIf weather deteriorates at any affected location, there remains potential for significant operational impact until full mitigations can be put into place for all commercial aircraft,\u201d SkyWest said.  But the company has already had to deal with a few diversions. \u201cWeather conditions at some airports led to a small number of flight cancels and diversions this morning as a result of 5G implementation,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe will process changes as soon as we receive the FAA\u2019s mitigations for our E175 aircraft in low visibility conditions.\u201d  \u201cAs always, we will not compromise safety,\u201d Skywest added.   Several other regional carriers referred questions to the RAA or did not respond.   The issue meant that a United Express flight headed to San Francisco on Thursday was stuck circling the airport because of poor weather.  United acknowledged the issue. SkyWest did not immediately comment on this particular flight.     \u201cIf there\u2019s weather at the destination airport or the forecast of weather, then the dispatch isn\u2019t going to release that flight,\u201d Black said, leading to a delay or cancelation. \u201cIn the instance that aircraft are enroute and are inbound to an airport, and fog rolls in \u2026 then you\u2019re going to have to circle, and then eventually divert to a reliever airport.\u201d   The result leaves travelers in unexpected places, and planes and crews out of position for the next flight.   \u201cThe ripple effects of this will be very substantial,\u201d Black told CNN. \u201cAll of our members are looking into it.  They are developing these contingency plans.\u201d  ",

            "text": "Both American Airlines and United Airlines reported better-than-expected financial results, despite problems brought on by the Omicron surge during the holiday travel period. But both said they expect problems from the variant early this year. American, the nation\u2019s largest airline, lost $921 million in the quarter, excluding special items. That was less than the $1.2 billion forecast by analysts, and less than half than $2.2 billion it lost in the fourth quarter of 2020, before Covid vaccines were widely available. Its revenue reached $9.4 billion, more than double the $4 billion of a year earlier. More impressively, it was down only 17% from the revenue it posted in the fourth quarter of 2019, before the pandemic started hurting air travel. But the company said that the revenue this quarter will be down 20% to 22% compared to the first quarter of 2019, as the surge in Omicron eats into demand for flights. \u201cThe Omicron variant has affected the timing of a full revenue recovery,\u201d said Robert Isom, American\u2019s president who is due to become CEO on April 1. \u201cBookings are recovering quickly after dropping off considerably in early December, though they\u2019re still not back to pre-Omicron levels.\u201d  He said leisure travel is close to 100% of pre-pandemic level, and that much of the small and medium size business travel is also recovering.  But large corporate travel is still only 40% of pre-pandemic levels, and international travel is still down significantly due to limitations on those flights by various governments around the globe. Those are among the most lucrative tickets sold by airlines. United\n            \n                (UAL) reported a loss of $520 million excluding special items, which was also better than than $700 million loss forecast by analysts. It was also a significant improvement from the $2.1 billion it lost a year ago. But the airline said it was pulling back on its early 2022 schedule due to softness in bookings with the surge in Covid cases caused by Omicron. It said it now expects to have less passenger capacity on its flights in 2022 than in 2019, rather than the increased capacity it had previously forecast. It said the new cuts in its schedule reflected \u201cthe impact of the Omicron spike on demand.\u201d \u201cWhile Omicron is impacting near term demand, we remain optimistic about the spring and excited about the summer and beyond,\u201d said CEO Scott Kirby. All airlines had challenges in the last two weeks of 2021 and early 2022 from thousands of flights being canceled due to a significant number of their staff members calling off sick with Omicron and bad winter weather. Last week Delta\n            \n                (DAL) reported those cancellations cost it $80 million in just the last two weeks of 2021. Neither American nor United broke out a cost of their own cancellations.",

            "title": "The 5G-airline snafu: Everything we know",
            "text": "The attempt to roll out amped up mobile service across the United States has been a bit of a mess. The aviation industry and transportation regulators are worried about new 5G antennas interfering with a key type of aircraft altimeter that\u2019s essential for landing planes in bad weather. But wireless carriers and telecom regulators have said there\u2019s nothing to fear.  The authorities have been in a weeks-long stalemate. And the whole thing culminated this week with some major international airlines canceling some US flights, as regulators, telecom giants, and airlines blew past a deadline to come to an agreement. AT&T and Verizon are now, yet again, delaying their plans to switch on their new 5G antennas near certain airports. Regulators are still hashing out solutions. And a lot remains unclear. The President of Emirates, Sir Tim Clark, told CNN on Wednesday that the airline was not aware of some of the potential 5G rollout issues until yesterday morning, calling the situation \u201cone of the most delinquent, utterly irresponsible\u201d he has seen in his aviation career. Here\u2019s everything we do \u2014 and don\u2019t \u2014 know about the snafu.  What exactly is the issue? Telecom companies have rolled out 5G networks to various locations across the United States over the last few years, delivering the next generation of cellular phone data speeds. But on Wednesday, Verizon and AT&T turned on their C-band 5G networks \u2014 an important set of radio frequencies that will supercharge the internet as we know it.  Unfortunately, the C-Band sits near the band of frequencies used by aircraft radar altimeters, an instrument that tells pilots how high their plane is off the ground and is crucial for landing airplanes in low visibility conditions. The Federal Communications Commission auctioned off the C-band spectrum to US wireless carriers last year \u2014 an $81 billion sale. But airlines warned of dire consequences for transportation and the overall economy over concerns that the C-band technology could interfere with the radar altimeters that pilots use to land in low visibility conditions. (Airlines estimated 1,000 flight disruptions would occur each day following the rollout). On Tuesday, Emirates, Air India, All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines, Lufthansa and British Airways all announced changes to some flights, citing the issue. Some have added back flights or switched aircraft.  International carriers seemed to be caught off guard and had to act quickly because of the length of these long-haul flights. Domestic carriers have also said they\u2019re monitoring the situation. Airlines for America, a trade association, said in a statement Wednesday that \u201cbecause of the agreements the White House reached with AT&T and Verizon yesterday [to delay 5G deployment at major airports], thousands of flights are taking off and landing safety at airports across the country.\u201d The FAA said in its own statement that it had also cleared more airplanes to fly safely near 5G towers, but \u201cflights at some airports may still be affected.\u201d \u201cEven with these approvals, flights at some airports may still be affected,\u201d the FAA said. \u201cThe FAA also continues to work with manufacturers to understand how radar altimeter data is used in other flight control systems. Passengers should check with their airlines for latest flight schedules.\u201d United Airlines said it anticipated \u201cminor disruptions\u201d on Wednesday but it\u2019s \u201cpleased the Biden Administration reached a compromise with AT&T and Verizon to avoid mass cancellations.\u201d What\u2019s being done about it? Transportation regulators had already been concerned that the version of 5G that was scheduled to be switched on could interfere with some airplane instruments, and many aviation industry groups shared those fears \u2014 despite reassurances from federal telecom regulators and wireless carriers. Aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus also weighed in, warning Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in a December letter that the 5G rollout will cause interference that could \u201cadversely affect the ability of aircraft to safely operate.\u201d In December, the FAA issued an urgent order forbidding pilots from using potentially affected altimeters around airports where low-visibility conditions would otherwise require them. That new rule could keep planes from getting to some airports in certain circumstances, because pilots would be unable to land using instruments alone, and it affects more than 6,800 US airplanes and dozens of aircraft manufacturers. The aviation industry also made a desperate last push to get wireless carriers to further delay the 5G roll out, which had already been delayed. It was initially slated for Dec. 5, 2021. But the issue was never fully resolved. That\u2019s how we got to this week\u2019s snafu, with airlines scrambling to rebook or cancel flights. Then, AT&T \u2014 which owns CNN parent company WarnerMedia \u2014 and Verizon made an 11th-hour pledge to delay the 5G deployment around some airports. A White House official told CNN on Tuesday that the administration is talking with the FAA, FCC, wireless carriers, airlines and aircraft equipment manufacturers to find a solution that still allows the 5G rollout without sacrificing the safety of flights. But Faye Malarkey Black \u2014 the head of the Regional Airline Association, which represents airlines that largely service rural America \u2014 has taken to Twitter to air complaints that the RAA hasn\u2019t been involved in any of the discussions. She also posted that \u201c0% of the regional airline fleet has been cleared to perform low visibility landings at #5G impacted airports if/when weather drops below minimums. Today\u2019s fair weather is saving rural America from severe air service disruption.\u201d The FAA responded only that it is \u201creviewing testing data for altimeters used in regional jets.\u201d During a press conference Wednesday afternoon, President Joe Biden had this to say to reporters: \u201cThe issue of whether or not we\u2019re dealing with 5G or not, we don\u2019t deal with 5G. The fact is that you had two enterprises \u2014 two private enterprises\u2026They have government regulation visibly. And so what I\u2019ve done is pushed as hard as I can to have 5G folks hold up and abide by what was being requested by the airlines until they could more modernize them over the years,\u201d he said, apparently referring to the altimeters.  Faye Malarkey Black, however, struck a different tone in an interview with CNN. She said that what she has found \u201cperplexing was all these sort of victory dances about this deal \u2014 that this was a great deal and crisis averted. Crisis has not been averted. Crisis has been averted for urban centers.\u201d  Why is this happening in the US and not abroad? Europe rolled out 5G without any impact on aviation, standing in stark contrast to the furor going on in the United States. The distinction lies in some key technical details. Wireless carriers companies in Europe rolled out new 5G service in the 3.4 to 3.8 GHz range of spectrum. The United States is rolling out 5G service in a spectrum of radio waves with frequencies between in the 3.7 and to 3.98 GHz, which is a faster range and one that\u2019s a bit closer to the spectrum used by radar altimeters, which is between 4.2 and 4.4 GHz. And, according to the FAA, that\u2019s too close for comfort. Other countries are also using other mitigating tactics to prevent interference, such as restricting the placement of 5G antennas near airfields and requiring them to be tilted downward to limit potential interference with aircraft. As for how to remedy the United States\u2019 woes, Nicholas Calio, president and CEO of Airlines for America, weighed in on CNN: \u201cThe fix basically is working out where the bandwidth is, the amount of power used, the tilt of the antennas, the placement of the antennas,\u201d he said.  \u201cThere are mitigations that can be put in place, it\u2019s just going to take time to do it.  The fix can be almost immediate \u2014 tower by tower.\u201d Who\u2019s to blame? That\u2019s not entirely clear.  AT&T and Verizon pinned much of the blame on the Federal Aviation Administration in statements on Tuesday.  \u201cWe are frustrated by the FAA\u2019s inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services, and we urge it do so in a timely manner,\u201d AT&T spokesperson Megan Ketterer said in a statement. Verizon said in a separate statement that \u201cthe FAA and our nation\u2019s airlines have not been able to fully resolve navigating 5G around airports, despite it being safe and fully operational in more than 40 other countries.\u201d Emirates president Sir Tim Clark did not mince words about what he sees as the issue, placing blame on the structure of the US system, saying \u201cthis is one of the most delinquent, utterly irresponsible\u201d situations that he\u2019s seen in his aviation career. He added that the \u201crisks and dangers\u201d should have already been evaluated. Which airports are affected? We don\u2019t know. When the FAA issued its order in December, it included a list of airports that would need to have buffer zones for 5G. But it\u2019s not clear if AT&T and Verizon delayed the 5G deployment at all or some of those locations.  Nor is it clear how long they plan to delay deployment or if changes will ultimately need to be made to those antennas before than can be switched on.  What else don\u2019t we know? We still don\u2019t know exactly what is hanging up all these negotiations. Among the many voices at the table are the FCC, FAA, airlines, aircraft manufacturers, wireless carriers and industry groups \u2014 and the nature of their current impasse isn\u2019t entirely clear. We don\u2019t know who is asking for what. We don\u2019t know whether more testing will have to be done.  And, perhaps most troubling, we don\u2019t know when all this will be resolved. ",

            "text": "Goldman Sachs had a phenomenal year. But like many of its competitors on Wall Street, the numbers just weren\u2019t good enough to satisfy fickle investors. The investment banking powerhouse said Tuesday that it earned $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter, or $10.81 a share. But analysts had been forecasting a profit of $4.1 billion, or $11.70 a share. Shares of Goldman Sachs tumbled nearly 8% on the news. Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS), like many of its rivals, benefited from a boom in trading activity and as companies looked to go public or make acquisitions last year. Investment banking revenue soared 58% from a year ago in 2021.  Goldman Sachs said that overall revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $12.6 billion, topping forecasts and rising 8% from a year ago.  The company has also stepped up its efforts to cater to consumers and not just businesses, Goldman Sachs\u2019 consumer and wealth management business, which includes the company\u2019s Marcus online banking unit, posted record revenue last year.  For the full year, Goldman Sachs generated revenue of more than $59 billion and net income of $21.6 billion. \u201c2021 was a record year for Goldman Sachs. The firm\u2019s extraordinary performance is a testament to the strength of our client franchise and people,\u201d said Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon in a statement. \u201cMoving forward, our leadership team remains committed to growing Goldman Sachs, diversifying our businesses and delivering strong returns for shareholders.\u201d  Solomon also warned investors on the company\u2019s conference call with analysts that inflation brought about by rising wages and supply chain disruptions tied to the outbreak of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 will likely persist for some time. \u201cThere\u2019s no surprise that the recent surge in cases is putting even more pressure on supply chains. Inflation is persisting in many countries, and major central banks are beginning to raise rates,\u201d Solomon said.  He added, \u201cInflation may be above trend for some time. And in the near term, inflationary pressures may continue to intensify before they start to decrease. I also believe that we could see more volatility as these easing policies are unwound.\u201d Still, Solomon expressed hope that the global economy will soon be past the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic. Goldman Sachs, like most other Wall Street firms, has delayed plans to have many of its employees return to its Manhattan headquarters.  \u201cMy view is that Covid-19 will be endemic and as a society, we will find a way to live with it, supported by the efficacy of vaccines and new treatments,\u201d he said, adding that Goldman Sachs will need to be \u201cflexible and dynamic with our protocols to adapt to this new state of the world while also enabling the majority of our people to be back in the office safely.\u201d Goldman Sachs had a lot of hype to live up to in its earnings report. Shares surged 45% in 2021, making Goldman Sachs the third best performer in the Dow, trailing only Home Depot\n            \n                (HD) and Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT). Shares of Goldman Sachs fell Friday, a day when JPMorgan Chase\n            \n                (JPM) and Citigroup\n            \n                (C) both reported earnings that weren\u2019t strong enough to satisfy investors either. Goldman Sachs employees benefited from the solid 2021 results though. The company said Tuesday it set aside $17.7 billion in compensation and benefits for its staff last year, an increase of 33% from 2020. That works out to an average of nearly $404,000 for the firm\u2019s 43,900 workers.",

            "text": "When you\u2019ve already sent a stuntwoman in flight attendant uniform up the world\u2019s tallest building, it can be hard to think of what trick to pull next.  If you\u2019re UAE flag-carrier Emirates, you send her to perch on top of Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa again, but this time get the world\u2019s largest passenger jet to do a fly-past.  Last August, Emirate\u2019s video ad went viral after Nicole Smith-Ludvik ascended 828 meters to the very top of the building\u2019s spire, dressed in skirt, heels and the airline\u2019s instantly recognizable hat and scarf.  Now in new photos and video released this week, she\u2019s up there again to promote Expo 2020 Dubai. With the city spread out below, a superjumbo in an Expo livery glides past her half a mile away at a speed of 145 knots or 167 mph (an A380\u2019s cruise speed is usually 480 knots) before going on a fly-past over the Expo site.  This impressive feat of derring-do took place over two days in October 2021, and involved the A380 circuiting the Burj Khalifa 11 times at the low altitude of 2,700 feet, the exact height of the building.  Formation flying It\u2019s by no means the first time an Airbus A380 has been used for high-profile stunts.  The superjumbo was developed at a cost of $25 billion and, with capacity for up to 853 passengers, it\u2019s the largest mass-produced civil airliner in history.  The double-decker craft was popular with customers but costly to run, and Airbus announced in 2019 that it would be discontinuing its production. The last ever A380 was delivered to Emirates, its biggest customer, at the end of last year.  Emirates has 115 of the mammoth planes in its fleet and it\u2019s not shy of getting them out for a press event.  The 2019 Air Show in Dubai opened with a superjumbo flying at an altitude of just 1,000 feet in formation with 26 planes from the United Arab Emirates\u2019 Al Fursan air display team.  That was two years after an A380 owned by the UAE\u2019s other flag-carrier, Etihad, kicked off the action at the 2017 Abu Dhabi Formula One Grand Prix by also flying alongside the Al Fursan team.  Back in 2015, a massive Emirates A380 dwarfed its flying companions as it went for a 10-minute flight over Dubai\u2019s Palm Jumeriah islands in a holding pattern with two jetpack pilots from Jetman Dubai.  Going further back again, in 2013 Emirates and Australian flag-carrier Qantas marked an alliance between the two airlines by flying A380s from each of their fleets over Sydney Harbour, at an altitude of 1500 feet.  It\u2019s not just airlines that have called upon the superjumbo to promote their brand.  In 2017, Porsche got into Guinness World Records by getting a standard Porsche Cayenne car to tow a 285-tonne Air France A380 for a distance of 42 meters at Paris Charles De Gaulle Airport.  The A380 has four engines, making it less fuel-efficient than twin-engined craft \u2013 so perhaps all these publicity jaunts can seem a little wasteful.  Nevertheless, Airbus itself has more than once been playful in its choice of flight routes when debuting new craft.  In December 2017, one of its flight test teams \u201cdrew\u201d a Christmas tree in the skies over Hamburg, Germany.   Most fittingly of all, for one of aviation\u2019s most-loved planes, when the last ever A380 to be produced made its pre-delivery flight over Hamburg at the end of last year, its pilots followed a heart-shaped flight route, sending a final message to the plane\u2019s many fans.

There\u2019s reason for concern. In 2003, a surface-to-air missile slammed into the left wing of an Airbus A330 operating for DHL just after takeoff from Baghdad. The crew returned to the airport unharmed.  \u201cIn recent years, in several incidents abroad, civilian aircraft were fired upon by man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS),\u201d the FAA document says. \u201cThis has led several companies to design and adapt systems like a laser-based missile-defense system for installation on civilian aircraft, to protect those aircraft against heat-seeking missiles.\u201d Now aviation regulators will hear 45 days of public comment before approving \u201ca system that emits infrared laser energy outside the aircraft as a countermeasure against heatseeking missiles\u201d on Airbus A321-200 aircraft.  The FAA document says FedEx started the government approval process for modifying A321-200s back in 2019, even though the company does not yet own such aircraft. FedEx has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. The FAA stipulates that any approval must include \u201cmeans that prevent the inadvertent activation of the system on the ground, including during airplane maintenance and ground handling,\u201d since laser accidents \u201ccan result in eye and skin damage.\u201d",

            "text": "Shares of Virgin Galactic \u2014 the space tourism company that carried its billionaire founder, Richard Branson, to the edge of space last summer \u2014 took a major price hit on Thursday after the company announced it\u2019s raising as much as half a billion dollars in debt. Its stock shed more than 16% at one point during trading Thursday morning, hitting a low of $10.36 per share. That\u2019s a far cry from its all-time high of $62.80, hit in early 2021. The company is issuing at least $425 million \u2014 and possibly up to $500 million \u2014 worth of convertible senior notes, a type of debt instrument, in a private offering. In a statement, Virgin Galactic said it plans to \u201cuse the net proceeds from the offering to fund working capital, general and administrative matters and capital expenditures to accelerate the development of its spacecraft fleet in order to facilitate high-volume commercial service.\u201d The hit to the company\u2019s stock compounded an already rough few months for the company.  Ever since Virgin Galactic garnered international attention by launching Branson to space in July 2021, the company has faced significant delays. A report from the New Yorker revealed that warning lights had gone off in the cockpit during Branson\u2019s flight and the space plane had traveled outside its designated airspace for 41 seconds. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights pending a review, which concluded in September and gave Virgin Galactic the all-clear.  Still, the company is delaying the start of commercial services, citing unrelated technology upgrades, and isn\u2019t expected to fly paying customers before this October. At the time Virgin Galactic went public in 2019, it had been touting plans to start commercial service in 2020.   Meanwhile, Virgin Galactic\u2019s chief competitor in the suborbital space tourism game, Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin, has launched three successful crewed missions for celebrities and paying customers.",

            "text": "Stellantis, the company formed last year through the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and France\u2019s PSA Group, has some catching up to do when it comes to comes to electric cars. Chief executive Carlos Tavares said he knows that, of course, but being first isn\u2019t everything. Tavares is approaching his one year anniversary leading Stellantis, a company formed on January 16, 2021, through the merger of the two automakers. The sprawling company, officially headquartered in the Netherlands, sells cars, trucks and SUVs under 14 different brands, including Dodge, Fiat, Ram, Jeep, Chrysler, Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot.  Stellantis currently offers 18 different electric models across various brands, almost all in Europe. All were introduced over the past two years, and most are electric versions of gasoline-powered cars, crossovers and vans. The company plans to add eight more electric models in the next year and a half but, for now, offers no fully electric vehicles at all in the US. Tesla sold nearly a million electric vehicles in 2021, and electric offerings from major players like Ford, Volkswagen, General Motors and Mercedes have all hit showroom floors. In many cases, those brands have also seen strong sales.  But Stellantis has big plans for electric vehicles and, in an interview with CNN Business, Tavares insisted that being a little late to the game can have its advantages. For instance, Stellantis doesn\u2019t expect to have an electric pickup in the US market until 2024. That means its engineers and designers get to take a good, hard look at the Ford F-150 Lightning, entering production in a few months, and at General Motors\u2019 Chevrolet Silverado EV, just recently revealed and going into production next year. Tesla is also supposed to be coming out with its Cybertruck pickup eventually, but after years of delays the company no longer has a publicly stated firm production date. Tesla did not respond to an email seeking an update. The Ram 1500 EV will come out after others are already on the market but, Tavares promises, Stellantis is using the time well. \u201cSo I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s good to be number two or number three in terms of timing,\u201d Tavares said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, that if this is the situation in which I am, I would be stupid not to leverage that to make the best truck of the market.\u201d Tavares insists that Stellantis is pursuing electrification aggressively, despite the fact that he has questions about its long term efficacy. Electric cars don\u2019t represent a solution to the climate crisis on their own, he points out, but only when and where electric power is generated without emissions. Otherwise we\u2019re just polluting differently. Also, the added weight of electric cars \u2013 battery packs are very heavy \u2013 is a testament to their demand for raw materials and exotic metals which can cause ethical and environmental problems, too, he said. For now, electric cars seem like the best option but, he said, in a few decades something better may present itself \u201cIf you step back and you don\u2019t look at it in the time window of the next 10 years, [but] you look at it in a time window of 30 or 40 years, who knows?\u201d he said. For now, electric cars seem like the way to go, so Stellantis is in. \u201cWe are sincere in the fact that there is no other better solution right now than electrification,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we go full speed and we go full power on that direction.\u201d So far Stellantis hasn\u2019t committed to becoming fully electric by any specific date. While  GM has said it will sell nothing but zero emission vehicles \u2013 presumably most of them battery-powered electric cars \u2013 by 2035, Stellantis has only said that 40% of the vehicles it sells in the United States will be electric and 70% in Europe by 2030.  Stellantis will present a more detailed strategy on March 1, 2022. Some plans have already been made public. For instance, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month, it was announced that Chrysler will become a fully electric car brand in 2028, three years after its first electric model comes out.  And while it may not be first with an electric truck or SUV, Stellantis\u2019 Dodge brand will be first with an electric muscle car, which is expected in 2024. \u201cI can tell you are going to fall in love with that because the cars are fantastic,\u201d Tavares said. \u201cMy God. I am just so impatient to see those cars rolling on the US highways.\u201d",

            "title": "Why airplanes might soon have just one pilot",
            "text": "If you boarded a passenger plane in 1950 and peeked into the cockpit, you would have seen five people in there (almost certainly men): two pilots, a radio operator, a navigator and a flight engineer. Over the years, technical advances in radio communications, navigation systems and on-board monitoring equipment gradually removed the need for the last three, making it possible to safely fly a passenger plane with just two pilots. That has been the norm in commercial aviation for about 30 years. Soon, however, things could streamline further, and one of the two remaining pilots \u2013 technically the first officer \u2013 could soon go, leaving behind only the captain. Many smaller and military aircraft are already manned by a single pilot, but for commercial aviation this would mean venturing into a brave new world.  A challenging transition \u201cThe transition from a two-pilot cockpit to a single-pilot cockpit will be significantly more challenging than the transitions from a five-person cockpit to a two-person cockpit,\u201d says a 2014 study on single-pilot operations by NASA, which has done research on the subject for well over a decade. According to the same study, a properly implemented switch could \u201cprovide operating cost savings while maintaining a level of safety no less than conventional two-pilot commercial operations.\u201d  But how do you safely get rid of one pilot? One way is to greatly increase automation in the cockpit, devoting more tasks to computers. Another is to offload the same tasks from the cockpit to the ground, with the remaining pilot working as a member of a \u201cdistributed crew.\u201d The latter approach seems more feasible, at least in the short term, because much of what is required to implement it already exists. \u201cTechnologically you could argue that in in a lot of cases we\u2019re already there,\u201d says Patrick Smith, an airline pilot flying Boeing 767 aircraft and the author of the popular book and blog \u201cAsk the Pilot.\u201d \u201cBut by doing that,\u201d he continues, \u201cyou eliminate certain redundancies and I have a hard time with that, because I fly aeroplanes for a living and even with two pilots in the cockpit things can become extremely busy \u2013 to the point of task saturation for both of them.\u201d  Increased workload In one scenario, proposed by NASA, the remaining pilot in the cockpit would be supported by a \u201csuper dispatcher\u201d on the ground, a trained pilot that could oversee a number of flights at once and even fully control the plane remotely if needed, for example if the cockpit pilot become incapacitated.  Another option is the \u201charbor pilot,\u201d also a trained pilot but specializing in a specific airport, who could offer assistance with multiple planes arriving and departing from that airport. NASA has conducted tests for these setups by placing pilots from real crews in separate rooms, before presenting them with difficult flight conditions on a Boeing 737 simulator.   All pilots were able to land their planes safely, but the study showed \u201csignificant increases in workload\u201d compared to regular two-crew operations, resulting in \u201csubjective assessments of safety and performance being significantly degraded.\u201d Missing the visual cues from the other pilot sometimes resulted in confusion or uncertainty about which tasks had been completed or not. Having only one pilot on board would save airlines money, but only if the new ground operators and advanced automation doesn\u2019t end up costing more, NASA says. Additional minor savings could come from smaller or lighter cockpits in future aircraft. Reduced crew There\u2019s also another way to implement single-pilot operations, but only on long-haul flights, which currently require a third pilot that takes over when one of the other two is resting.  In this scenario, the third pilot would be removed and the two remaining ones would operate normally during takeoff and landing, but take alternating breaks during the cruise portion of the flight. \u201cIn that case, you\u2019re going from two pilots to one pilot in certain regimes of flight,\u201d says Smith. \u201cBut in the other regimes of flight and when necessary, there would always still be at least two pilots there. I\u2019m open to that conversation \u2013 I\u2019m a lot more amenable to that conversation than the idea of removing a pilot entirely.\u201d  Airbus and Cathay Pacific are already testing this on the A350: \u201cWe are engaged in studies on operational patterns for flight crew on long-range flights,\u201d an Airbus spokesperson confirmed to CNN. \u201cThese studies are ongoing and based on a minimum of two operating crew per flight. They are being undertaken in conjunction with the regulatory authorities and airline partners.\u201d The goal is to certify the A350 for this kind of operation over the next few years.  Cathay Pacific also confirmed its involvement as \u201cone of a number of airlines engaging with Airbus,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN, and that \u201cthis is a long-term commitment to a project that is still very much in its conceptual stage.\u201d They added that, even if the concept is approved and introduced in the future, \u201call of the aircraft in [Cathay Pacific\u2019s] existing fleet are certified to operate with a minimum of two pilots on board and that there is no plan to reduce that number.\u201d Pilot backlash Airlines are accelerating on single-pilot operations not just because it could save them money, but because of a looming pilot shortage on the horizon.  Boeing predicts a need for 600,000 new pilots in the next two decades, but by some estimates there will be a shortfall of at least 34,000 pilots globally by 2025. Reducing the number of pilots on some crews or aircraft could help mitigate the impact of this. However, the group that will offer the strongest opposition will likely be pilots themselves.  \u201cThat\u2019s because we\u2019re advocating on our behalf to save our jobs, but also because we have a pretty good understanding of how commercial aeroplanes operate and the vastness of the challenges involved,\u201d says Smith. The Airline Pilots Association, International (ALPA), the largest airline pilot union in the world, released a paper in 2019 about the dangers of single-pilot operations. It called the idea \u201cpremature\u201d and based on \u201cmany costly and unproven technologies,\u201d and stated that \u201cthe most vital safety feature in transport-category aircraft now and for the foreseeable future [is] two experienced, trained, and rested professional pilots in the cockpit.\u201d  The paper also says that no autonomous system can compensate for an incapacitated pilot, and that there are many examples of incidents where two pilots in the cockpit were needed to recover from equipment malfunctions that otherwise would have likely resulted in disaster. One such incident, often cited as a brilliant example of cockpit collaboration, is the casualty-free 2009 Hudson river landing of damaged US Airways Flight 1549 by Captain Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger and First Officer Jeff Skiles.   The 2015 Germanwings Flight 9525, during which the first officer locked himself in the cockpit while the captain was on a bathroom break, then intentionally crashed the plane into a mountain in an apparent suicide, is also often brought up to highlight the risks of leaving a single individual at the controls of an aircraft.  Would you? Perhaps the biggest hurdle on the path to a single pilot will be selling the idea to passengers. In 2019 Don Harris, a professor of human factors at Coventry University in the UK, conducted a focus group and survey on the prospect of flying on an airliner with just one pilot.  Just about 50% of participants said they\u2019d be willing to take that flight, and the general consensus was that removing a pilot is \u201cdangerous until proven safe.\u201d The three factors that weighed the most in the participants\u2019 decision process were the state of the pilot, trust in the technology and a combination of ticket price and airline reputation, signaling that a significantly reduced fare would help sell the idea. In the study, Harris concludes that the single-crew airliner is still probably 20 years away, but that legislative developments could make that a reality sooner, albeit only for cargo aircraft. Smith agrees: \u201cMaybe there\u2019s room for something like that further down the the aviation chain, small aeroplanes or cargo operations, air taxi operations, charters. But implementing that at the major airline level, that\u2019s a long way off.\u201d According to Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at Teal Group, the move will take many more years, although it\u2019s inevitable: \u201cI don\u2019t think passenger perception is very important, but establishing guaranteed and secure data links with ground stations is a must, and of course an appropriate amount of time for regulators and insurance people to get comfortable with this too.\u201d Removing a pilot from the cockpit, however, will help develop the very technology required for the next, and final, step: removing human pilots altogether and fly planes remotely or autonomously. That, however, sounds like an even more complicated conversation: \u201cTwo pilots to one pilot is a major step,\u201d says Smith, \u201cbut one pilot to no pilots is an immense one.\u201d",

            "text": "If 2021 was the year of ostentatious displays of wealthy space tourists chartering one-off missions, 2022 promises to be yet another year solidifying the private sector\u2019s grip on modern space travel. Big businesses are beginning to permeate every area of spaceflight, from the most spectacular private launches to the smallest detail. A modified version of Amazon\u2019s Alexa virtual assistant will even hitch a ride on a future NASA trip around the moon. More missions to space chartered by the ultra-rich are on the docket. Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX is also planning to put its colossal 400-foot-tall Starship rocket \u2014 intended to eventually reach Mars \u2014 into Earth\u2019s orbit for the first time.  As in past years, federal regulators will grapple with what its role can and should be in this new era. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s to come. Starship and the FAA SpaceX, the poster child of the commercial space era, has been anxious to get a full-scale version of its Starship rocket launched on its first orbital test flight. The launch would be momentous. Starship promises to out-power any rocket ever built, including the Saturn V rockets that took astronauts to the moon in the last century.  (NASA is also launching its own new rocket this year \u2014 a test mission for the next lunar landing called Artemis 1 \u2014 that will make use of a different rocket that also promises to out-power the Saturn V.) After a few high-altitude test launches in the first half of 2021 of the upper spaceship, the company has been assembling its first full-scale Starship rocket \u2014 complete with a gargantuan rocket booster that promises to propel the spaceship into orbit. Musk had indicated the company was prepared to get that test flight off the ground as soon as July of last year.  But the back half of 2021 was full of hangups. The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, was carrying out an environmental assessment to review what the impact would be of launching such a massive rocket from a stretch of rural Texas coastline. A public comment period in October aired the voices of many local residents strongly opposed to the idea, as well as some fervent supporters who weren\u2019t necessarily from the area. Participants in the public comments were allowed to dial in from anywhere. And while most people spoke in favor of letting the project move forward, the people who identified themselves as living in the vicinity of SpaceX\u2019s South Texas launch site were mostly opposed, according to a tally kept by Joey Roulette, then a reporter at The Verge.  Though SpaceX initially expected to get the all-clear by the end of 2021, according to the FAA, the environmental assessment will continue until at least February 28, 2022. The agency cited \u201cthe high volume of comments submitted\u201d and \u201cdiscussions and consultation efforts with consulting parties\u201d as reasons for the delay. Orbital tourism and astronaut launches With its Starship program in limbo, SpaceX has kept its astronaut launches, conducted in partnership with NASA, pretty much on schedule.  And there\u2019s more to come. The astronauts that launched to the International Space Station aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule are set to return as soon as April, with a new crew of four slated to launch aboard their own Dragon capsule to replace them that same month.  With NASA\u2019s blessing, SpaceX is also free to sell flights aboard Dragon to anyone who can afford it. The company plans to do just that, following up its 2021 Inspiration-4 mission with a four-person mission chartered by Houston-based startup Axiom that will take three businessmen and a former astronaut to the International Space Station. Plans for other SpaceX tourism flights to orbit are also in the works, though firm plans and launch dates haven\u2019t been locked down. Opportunities for hitching a ride to orbit may also expand this year if Boeing gets its planned Starliner spacecraft up and running. Boeing was contracted alongside SpaceX to develop a crew-worthy spacecraft, capable of carrying professional astronauts to the ISS and, if the company so pleases, well-heeled tourists. But Boeing has been beleaguered by numerous testing and development hangups. Starliner was most recently taken off the launch pad after issues with its propulsion system were discovered shortly before a scheduled test flight of the vehicle. The company now says the earliest that uncrewed test launch can get off the ground is May of 2022. Branson, Bezos and suborbital space tourism Richard Branson\u2019s and Jeff Bezos\u2019 space companies have for years been working to develop spacecraft capable of taking paying customers on brief, supersonic trips to the edge of space. In 2021, both billionaires made their own treks to the edge of space aboard their respective spacecraft.  Both of their flights ended without apparent issue, with the men emerging from their spacecraft outfitted in custom flight suits and beaming for the cameras. Bezos\u2019 successful July launch catapulted the company into a busy rest of the year spent flying some high-profile figures as \u201chonorary guests\u201d \u2014 meaning they didn\u2019t have to pay for tickets. 2022 promises to bring even more activity from the space tourism company, called Blue Origin, though the company has not yet announced flight dates or passengers for the year ahead. But Virgin Galactic is up against significant delays. A report from the New Yorker revealed that warning lights had gone off in the cockpit during Branson\u2019s flight and the space plane had traveled outside its designated airspace for 41 seconds. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights pending a review, which concluded in September and gave Virgin Galactic the all-clear. Still, the company is delaying the start of commercial services until at least the third quarter of 2022, citing unrelated technology upgrades. Labor issues already cropping up Blue Origin, meanwhile, has faced its own controversies, though none that have indicated specific safety issues with its rocket or spacecraft. Rather, a group of 21 current and former employees co-signed a letter alleging the company operates a toxic work environment where \u201cprofessional dissent\u201d is \u201cactively stifled.\u201d Blue Origin responded to the claims by saying it has \u201cno tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind.\u201d The essay prompted enough concern for the FAA to launch a review. But reporting from CNN Business also revealed that FAA investigators assigned to the task were hamstrung by a lack of legal protections for whistleblowers in the commercial spaceflight industry.  Emails obtained by CNN Business showed the review was closed even though investigators never had the chance to speak with any of the people who anonymously signed the whistleblower essay. The situation again highlighted the complexity of the commercial space industry\u2019s federally designated \u201clearning period\u201d \u2014 a designation that effectively bars regulators from implementing certain new rules or wielding the same oversight powers it does for other industries. That designation is set to expire in 2023, and the FAA indicated that lawmakers are monitoring the situation and considering a change. The whole thing could also soon become the subject of a Government Accountability Office report. Emails obtained by CNN Business show the GAO reached out to the FAA for more information about its Blue Origin probe.  Meanwhile, the allegations about Blue Origin\u2019s workplace culture \u2014 which were echoed in a separate whistleblower essay about SpaceX \u2014 has put the commercial space industry under heightened scrutiny.  A big, crowded, empty void Similar questions about how to regulate outer space in the age of commercialization are playing out on the international stage. With SpaceX and others putting up thousands of satellites for a new space-based businesses, and a recent satellite destruction test carried out by the Russian government \u2014 concerns about overcrowding in Earth\u2019s orbit are mounting.  There were numerous recent, high-profile events highlighting the stakes of the problem: SpaceX Starlink satellites nearly collided with the Chinese space station, the International Space Station has had to maneuver out of the path of debris on numerous occasions, and defunct rockets have fallen out of orbit uncontrolled. Groups within the United Nations have been working for decades to update international treaties governing the use of outer space. So far, they\u2019ve been largely unsuccessful. But the effort is gaining attention once again with a November 1 resolution that created an open-ended working group that will assess \u201ccurrent and future threats to space operations, determine when behavior may be considered irresponsible, \u2018make recommendations on possible norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors,\u2019 and contribute to the negotiation of legally binding instruments; \u2013 including a treaty to prevent \u2018an arms race in space,\u2019\u201d according to a recently published article written by two space policy experts.",

South Korea\u2019s Kospi\n            \n                (KOSPI) slid 1.1%. Stocks in China were flat. European stocks fell at the open. In afternoon trading, France\u2019s CAC 40\n            \n                (CAC40) was down 1.3%, while Germany\u2019s DAX 30\n            \n                (DAX) declined 1.1%. The FTSE 100\n            \n                (UKX) dropped 0.7% in London. A strong US economy and higher inflation could lead the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates faster than investors had anticipated, minutes from the central bank\u2019s December meeting showed. Some policymakers also want to step on the brakes by shrinking the Fed\u2019s balance sheet soon after rates begin to move higher.  \u201cOverall, faster tapering, earlier rate hikes and earlier balance sheet reduction are all on the cards if the economy and asset markets allow,\u201d wrote Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes in a research note. \u201cThe bigger longer-term question is whether there is enough stickiness to the inflation rate, to force the [Fed] to tolerate a deeper equity market correction than they might have in recent years before changing tack.\u201d The Dow\n            \n                (INDU), which had just hit a record high, closed down 1.1%, or 393 points, on Wednesday after the Fed minutes were released. The S&P 500\n            \n                (SPX), the broadest index tracking US equities, finished 1.9% lower, marking its worst day since late November.  All three major US indexes continued lower in early trading Thursday, falling by about 0.5%.  Tech stocks were hit particularly hard during Wednesday\u2019s session, with the Nasdaq Composite\n            \n                (COMP) dropping 3.3%, its worst performance since February 2021. When yields on government bonds rise, riskier investments become less attractive. The valuation of tech companies is also tied to future earnings, which look bleaker when inflation and higher rates are taken into account. Some global tech companies also came under pressure on Thursday. In Hong Kong, gaming company Bilibili\n            \n                (BILI) and short video platform Kuaishou shed about 6% and 4%, respectively. Germany\u2019s SAP\n            \n                (SAP) shed 2.7% in early trading.  Omicron is also looming over global markets. The coronavirus variant has led to a rapid increase in infections and fresh restrictions across the world, including a major lockdown in China and a weekend curfew in the Indian capital of New Delhi. India\u2019s benchmark S&P BSE Sensex\n            \n                (SENSEX) Index dipped 1% Thursday.  Investors have fretted for weeks over what the highly contagious strain would mean for global business and markets, while also bracing for the prospect of interest rate hikes in the coming months. \u2014 Anneken Tappe contributed to this report.

            "text": "During almost any other year, a look ahead to what the future holds for aviation would almost certainly be centered on exciting things like new airplanes, airlines and airports. But it would be impossible to discuss any developments in the industry for 2022 without making reference to Covid-19 variants, restrictions and challenges to airlines. Here we break down some of the most notable changes coming up for airlines, passengers, airports and the rest of aviation in the next 12 months, as well as the numerous problems the ongoing global pandemic continues to bring about \u2026  More Covid challenges How Covid-19 progresses, especially any new variants of the virus, is the major question for aviation.  At the time of writing, the Omicron variant is still being examined in order to determine how it compares to earlier variants like Delta and Alpha. But its emergence has already had a huge impact on travel, with flight bans in place, not to mention the number of travelers testing positive on arrival, passengers absconding from quarantine, and so on. Flight cancellations due to pilot shortages have also been an issue over the busy holiday period. One of the key challenge both airlines and passengers will face in 2022 is managing vaccination certification. This is especially true when it comes to defining what \u201cvaccinated\u201d means, especially around booster or third doses.  For instance, will travelers who\u2019ve received a single dose vaccine continue to be counted as fully vaccinated in the coming months? And what about those who\u2019ve had two of the two-dose vaccines, but haven\u2019t been administered with a booster jab? Will the rules differ for tourists who\u2019ve recovered from coronavirus and received one standard vaccination, as is customary in countries such as Germany, or children from countries where some youngsters are given just one dose of an mRNA vaccine? And how will Omicron affect vaccination statuses? There\u2019s some push for a digital QR-based standard (possibly the EU\u2019s Digital Covid Certificate), but that\u2019s going to need a lot of work and negotiation.  New airline launches Starting a new airline during a pandemic is a bit of a wild card to say the least, but Norse Atlantic Airways is rising to the challenge by launching long-haul low-cost flights between Europe and North America.  Of course, its founders would probably rather you didn\u2019t say \u201coh, like Norwegian used to do?\u201d  But as they\u2019re the same team who ran Norwegian and are planning to use the same Boeing 787 Dreamliners the airline used, it\u2019s not too far a stretch. In the US, another low cost venture, Northern Pacific Airways is aiming to launch in 2022 with the ambition of making Anchorage\u2019s Ted Stevens airport a hub connecting the United States and Asia via its fleet of of Boeing 757-200 narrow body passenger jets. Over in India, ultra-low-cost startup Akasa Air is looking to join the fray by summer, while the defunct Jet Airways is set for new life in early 2022. And the new airlines that launched in 2021 will be in expansion mode during the coming months. After starting up with flights from its base in Burbank, California in April 2021 to destinations in the west and northwest of the US, Avelo Airlines has been expanding, most recently to New Haven, Connecticut, with winter flights to six Florida destinations. Breeze Airways, meanwhile, continues to grow its network across the east, midwest and south of the United States, with a wide point-to-point network spanning San Antonio and Oklahoma City to Providence and a wide swathe of the country from Tampa to Akron/Canton and Tulsa.  Breeze is due to put its brand new Airbus A220 airplanes, which happen to be some of the most comfortable, quiet and spacious jets in the sky, into service during the second quarter of 2022. Keep an eye out for new services from familiar airlines. United Airlines, for example, is boosting its transatlantic network in summer 2022, adding new flights to Bergen in Norway, the Spanish Mediterranean island of Mallorca and the Canary island of Tenerife, Ponta Delgada in the Azores, and Amman in Jordan.  The airline is also bumping up its London services \u2013 with extra flights from Boston, Newark, Denver and San Francisco \u2013 as well as adding additional services to Munich, Milan, Berlin, Dublin and Rome from its hubs. If international travel remains complicated this year, airlines will want to keep their planes flying. This means they\u2019re likely to put them on the routes they think will make the most money \u2014 in this case, domestic routes (like within the US, India or China, or within Europe\u2019s Schengen area).  It\u2019s worth looking out for fare deals, but make sure they\u2019re refundable.  Revamped airports After a flurry of international airport openings in recent years, 2022 is set to be relatively quiet on this front.  However, some much welcomed new terminals will be launching in New York.  First up: LaGuardia Airport\u2019s Terminal C, home to Delta Air Lines, which is due to open in spring. This new terminal will definitely be a big improvement to the passenger experience.  The new Terminal A (previously called Terminal One, slightly confusingly) will launch at Newark, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, later in the year.  On the other side of the Pacific, Bangkok\u2019s main Suvarnabhumi Airport is set to open its new Satellite Terminal 1 in October, following numerous scheduling delays linked to the tourism slowdown during the pandemic.  Additionally, Chennai International Airport is due to open its own new terminal, which will replace the now-demolished terminals 2 and 3 this year, while Australia\u2019s Gold Coast Airport\u2019s three-level terminal expansion is also due for completion. To the south in the Indian Ocean, the Maldives\u2019 Velana International Airport is adding a new seaplane terminal and a new runway to accommodate larger aircraft.  And it\u2019s not just the big airports that are opening brand new terminals.  New facilities are due to open in Pune, Andaman/Port Blair and Leh in India, Provo in the US state of Utah, Columbia in Missouri, and Tacloban in Philippines. Aircraft deliveries The aviation industry tends to oscillate between two modes: \u201csell new airplanes\u201d and \u201cbuild those airplanes.\u201d Right now we\u2019re in the latter, with more of the latest planes arriving from factories. These include the Airbus A320neo family, A350 and A330neo and the Boeing 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner. Airbus has been steaming ahead with deliveries (460 as of the end of October, the last set of data the company has released) despite the pandemic, and the airliner manufacturer aims to build even more of its popular A320neo family \u2013 especially the longer A321neos that can hold up to 244 passengers in an all-economy layout.  Boeing, of course, has had a huge Max backlog after its safety grounding, while Dreamliner deliveries have been halted for more than a year because of production quality problems.  But they will eventually resume, and airlines are likely to put the aircraft directly into service. This has been the case with Singapore Airlines, which is putting its stored and newly built 737 Max 8 planes straight into the sky with a brand new cabin. The same thing is happening at flydubai, the all-737 airline which is a partner airline of Emirates.  Don\u2019t expect to see Boeing\u2019s massive stretched 777X in 2022, though. While it was scheduled for next year at one point, the first deliveries aren\u2019t expected until 2023 or 2024 now. But passengers are likely to see more aircraft like the Airbus A321LR (for Long Range) in 2022. An increasing amount of these planes are being produced, which means more flights straight to a central destination rather than connecting through a hub.  In 2023, keep an eye out for the A321XLR \u2013 you guessed it, that\u2019s Extra Long Range.   Updated seats and cabins While this particular \u201cbuild\u201d mode is less fun for plane fans at airshows, it\u2019s great news for passengers. Newer planes with updated seats, newer entertainment systems, at-seat power and faster Wi-Fi are currently in full \u201cbuild\u201d mode and fast arriving at airlines. For those flying business class in particular, this will mean more mini suites with privacy doors and all the bells and whistles they could wish for. Meanwhile, an increasing number of airplanes are being fitted with premium economy sections. Emirates is the latest airline to add the middle-cabin, announcing an upcoming 18-month program to install premium economy seats in a whopping 105 Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 airplanes. Economy cabins will also be getting some technology upgrades in the form of fast-charging USB-C sockets, inflight entertainment systems that integrate with phone apps, allowing passengers to use Bluetooth headphones. Other notable updates include space-saving seats that move those knee-crunching support structures out of the way of legs so that passengers feel like they have a bit more space on board, even if the seats are the same distance apart. Oddly enough, with quite a lot of older airplanes being retired during the pandemic, passengers are actually more likely than ever to get to fly on a newer plane with better entertainment and more of the mod cons in 2022.",

The deal will put Amazon software in Stellantis vehicles and will also put Stellantis\u2019s electric vans into Amazon\u2019s delivery fleet. Other automakers have reached similarly wide-ranging agreements in the past year with major tech companies. Ford announced a deal last year with Google to provide data hosting services for the automaker and to provide software for its cars. GM also announced a deal with Microsoft that involved the software company investing in Cruise, the self-driving car company in which GM is also a major investor, while also providing data hosting services to both GM and Cruise. Amazon and Stellantis will work together on a variety of projects, the companies said in an announcement. Besides in-vehicle software, the deal will include vehicle development work and training for software engineers. In-car software developed with Amazon would be available in a sort of in-car app store offering software tailored to the specific brands, according to the announcement. For instance, a Jeep might offer an off-road driving coach or a Pacifica minivan could have entertainment suggestions. The apps could also work with Amazon\u2019s internet-connected home products, such as security cameras and thermostats. The software will begin appearing in production vehicles in 2024, as Stellantis rolls out its own new in-car software platform. In a separate arrangement, Amazon has also agreed to become the first buyer of Stellantis\u2019 Ram ProMaster electric vans, expected to go into production in 2023. The vans were designed in collaboration with Amazon. Amazon already uses internal-combustion powered Ram and Fiat vans for much of its delivery fleet in the United States and Europe The companies did not say how much money was involved in the deals or exactly how many vans Amazon will buy except that it will be in the thousands annually. Amazon is already a major investor in Rivian, which makes electric pickups and SUVs. Amazon has agreed to purchase 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian, as well.",

            "text": "The past year has proved to be yet another incredibly difficult one for airlines as the slump in air travel continued throughout 2021 due to the impact of the ongoing pandemic. Even now, two years after Covid-19 was first brought to the world\u2019s attention, there are still far fewer flights and passengers taking to the skies The virus has also continued to dominated conversations around air safety, leading to some significant changes in the annual list of the world\u2019s safest airlines from AirlineRatings.com, an airline safety and product review website.  This year, Air New Zealand has come out on top on the annual safety table, which monitors 385 carriers from across the globe, measuring factors such as the airlines\u2019 crash and serious incident records, the age of their aircraft, as well as Covid-19 protocols and operational innovation.   Top ranking The flag carrier airline for New Zealand was awarded first place \u201cdue to its excellent incident record, number of cockpit innovations, pilot training and very low fleet age,\u201d according to Geoffrey Thomas, editor-in-chief of the Australian-based website. Etihad Airways took second place, while Qatar Airways came in third, with Singapore Airlines and TAP Portugal achieving fourth and fifth place respectively. Noticeably missing from the top five is Qantas, which held the title of world\u2019s safest airline from 2014 to 2017, as well as 2019 to 2021 (no clear winner could be found in 2018). Australia\u2019s flag carrier takes seventh place this time due to a \u201cslight increase in incidents coupled with the fleet age.\u201d In October 2021, a Qantas Boeing traveling from the Australian city of Perth to Adelaide in Western Australia was diverted due to a fuel imbalance, in an occurrence classified as a \u201cserious incident.\u201d \u201cThe last two years have been extremely difficult for airlines with Covid-19 slashing travel and Airline Ratings editors have particularly focused on the lengths airlines are undertaking to retrain pilots ahead of a return to service,\u201d explains Thomas.  \u201cAir New Zealand is a leader in this field with comprehensive retraining.\u201d    Safety advancements  The airline also received praise for being a world leader in operational safety advancements over the past four decades.   Its various initiatives include recently becoming one of the first airlines in the world to trial the use of Assaia Apron AI technology to improve its aircraft turn times.  \u201cAir New Zealand has excelled across the broad safety spectrum never losing sight of the smallest detail while caring for its flight crews who have worked under significant stress,\u201d Thomas tells CNN Travel.  On some occasions, AirlineRatings has chosen to simply name its winner, before listing the rest of the top airlines alphabetically. But the website has recently opted to rank each of the top 20 airlines in numerical order, revealing some significant movement from year to year. For example, Emirates was at number five on the 2021 list, but the UAE airline has been listed at 20th place this year, while Southwest Airlines was ranked 13th in 2021, but is not included in the new top 20 for 2022. AirlineRatings.com has also produced a list of the world\u2019s safest budget airlines, which are listed alphabetically as they are ranked equally, once again. The top 10 safest low-cost airlines are: Allegiant Air, easyJet, Frontier Airlines, Jetstar Group, Jetblue, Ryanair, Vietjet Air, Volaris, Westjet and Wizz Air.

Munger, who is a vice chairman at Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKB), also runs his own publicly traded company, newspaper publisher and investment firm, Daily Journal\n            \n                (DJCO), which has nearly doubled its stake in Alibaba \n            \n                (BABA) for the second time in recent months. According to a Tuesday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Daily Journal owned 602,060 shares of Alibaba as of the end of 2021, a stake worth $71.5 million. That\u2019s almost double its holdings as of the prior quarter, when Daily Journal owned 302,060 Alibaba shares, valued at the time at $44.7 million. Munger, who turned 98 on New Year\u2019s Day, has bet even more on Alibaba as its stock continues to fall due to concerns about a crackdown on big tech firms from Beijing as well as worries about slowing earnings growth at Alibaba.  Shares of Alibaba plunged 20% during the fourth quarter of last year after losing nearly half their value in 2020. Munger\u2019s bet on Alibaba is particularly noteworthy because he has made numerous controversial comments in the past year praising China for how it has handled criticism from tech moguls such as Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma. Although Daily Journal bought more Alibaba shares in the fourth quarter, it did not change its positions in four other investments: financial giants Bank of America\n            \n                (BAC), US Bancorp\n            \n                (USB), and Wells Fargo\n            \n                (WFC) as well as South Korean steelmaker Posco\n            \n                (PKX). Munger has also been in the headlines over the past year due to several stories focusing on the unusual architecture, most notably windowless dormitories, featured at schools where he has given significant donations to fund student housing. Munger has a net worth of $2.4 billion, according to Forbes.",

            "text": "Toyota is the leader in US auto sales for the first time, taking away a title that General Motors had held for nearly a century. It\u2019s yet another sign that US automakers have lost their dominance in their home market. As recently as 2005, Toyota was No. 4 in US sales, with GM, Ford and what was then known as DaimlerChrysler all in front, with a combined 57% of US sales between them. But in 2021, GM, Ford and Stellantis \u2014 the European automaker that owns Chrysler \u2014 had only 38% of the US market between them in the first nine months of the year. Even adding in Tesla only gets the US automakers to just over 40% of sales. Both Toyota\n            \n                (TM) and GM\n            \n                (GM) reported year-end sales Tuesday. GM\n            \n                (GM) posted full-year US sales of 2.2 million vehicles, which left it 114,000 vehicles, or 5% behind Toyota\n            \n                (TM).  GM fell slightly behind Toyota in second-quarter sales, and it was way behind in the third quarter. Toyota\u2019s fourth-quarter sales dropped by 30% compared to the last three months of 2020, but GM\u2019s sales plunged 43%, allowing Toyota to pad its lead.  A shortage of computer chips that limited production and the supply of vehicles was responsible for the plunge in sales at the end of the year. Industrywide US sales are forecast to be down 24% in the quarter, according to Cox Automotive. Most automakers will report US sales Tuesday, with Ford set to report its sales on Wednesday. Whether Toyota is able to keep the US sales lead in future years is uncertain, according to experts.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect Toyota to necessarily keep this lead,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of industry insights at Edmunds. \u201cIt\u2019s not like GM is doing something magical all these years. They just have more channels to sell in and more brands.\u201d GM suggested it expects to be back in the lead soon. \u201cThe semiconductor shortage, among other things, created an unprecedented set of circumstances in 2021,\u201d the company said. \u201cEven so, GM extended its lead in full-size pickups and SUVs. And 2022 begins with a gradually improving supply chain, and that should lead to growth in 2022 as we launch several new vehicles \u2013 including EVs and redesigned pickups.\u201d Chip shortage A shortage of computer chips led both automakers to slow or temporarily halt production at many factories. That cut off inventory for dealerships and drove car prices to record levels. A continued tight supply of chips in 2022 could force both automakers, and most of the rest of the industry, to build fewer vehicles than needed to meet demand. \u201cThe chips are still the wild card for this year,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, senior analyst with Cox Automotive. Krebs said part of GM\u2019s sales advantage in previous years was that it sold more of its car in fleet sales to businesses, such as rental car companies, typically at less than the retail price paid by consumers. But with a limited supply of cars, fleet sales have virtually disappeared this year, she said. The horse race The horse race between automakers is something that gets attention in the industry but not much from car buyers, said Krebs. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many buyers don\u2019t even know Chevy is part of GM or Lexus is part of Toyota,\u201d she said. Toyota took away the global lead in auto sales from GM in 2007, and for a few years the two went back-and-forth on global sales leadership with Toyota passing GM most recently in 2012. Now the race for global sales is between Toyota and Volkswagen. But GM, which took the top sales title from Ford back in 1927, has been able to maintain its US sales lead all the way through other tough periods. Those include 2019, when members of the United Auto Workers union shut down GM with a nearly six-week strike, and 2009, when GM was forced to file for bankruptcy \u2014 temporarily or permanently closing many US plants, discontinuing its weaker brands and shedding more than 1,000 dealerships. The outlook for GM appears brighter than its current woes, Caldwell said. It is betting big on an all-electric future, and Toyota is playing catch-up with its own EV plans. \u201cIf EVs and autonomous vehicles are the future, GM is setting themselves up quite well,\u201d she said. Toyota, which builds 70% of the cars and trucks that it sells in the United States at five US plants, issued a statement saying it is \u201cgrateful to our loyal customers for putting their safety and trust in Toyota and Lexus vehicles.\u201d It said its sales ranking has never been a focus or priority.   \u201cThe company\u2019s focus has always been \u2014 and will continue to be \u2014 on being the best brand in terms of safety and quality in customers\u2019 minds,\u201d said Toyota.",

            "text": "When future generations write about the history of space travel, 2021 may well get its own chapter. \u201cThe year of the billionaires,\u201d it might be called. Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson each took supersonic joy rides to the edge of space, finally bringing their competing private-sector spacecraft into operation after around two decades of promises. Celebrities such as 90-year-old \u201cStar Trek\u201d actor William Shatner and \u201cGood Morning America\u201d co-host Michael Strahan followed soon after. Another billionaire self-funded a historic, three-day mission aboard a SpaceX orbital capsule that flew higher than any human has traveled in decades. And all that promises to just be the beginning.  The trio of space billionaires \u2014 Branson, Bezos and Elon Musk \u2014 have their eyes set squarely on the future. Over the past year, their visions continued to bump up against one another, stirring up plenty of controversy and one-upmanship. Here\u2019s a look back at some of the most memorable moments the commercial space industry had to offer in the last year. Branson v. Bezos Branson\u2019s and Bezos\u2019 space companies have for years been working to develop spacecraft capable of taking paying customers on brief, supersonic trips to the edge of space, promising to usher in an age in which booking a flight to view the Earth from space is as easy as jetting across the Atlantic. (Musk\u2019s SpaceX, it should be noted, is not in the suborbital tourism game. Its rockets and spacecraft take much longer and more dangerous treks into Earth\u2019s orbit.) We\u2019re not quite there yet. But both billionaires pledged to kick off their respective suborbital space tourism businesses by taking the rides themselves, both as a show of their confidence in their vehicles\u2019 safety and some strategic PR.  Bezos, founder of the rocket firm Blue Origin, planned to become the first person ever to travel to space aboard a spacecraft his own company developed, setting his sights on a July 20 launch. (Blue Origin even auctioned off a ticket to ride alongside him for a whopping $28 million, though that auction winner did not ultimately fly.) Then, Branson swooped in, announcing days later that he planned to hop on the next flight of the rocket-powered space plane developed by his company, Virgin Galactic, on July 11 \u2014 nine days before Bezos\u2019 mission.  That set off an immediate wave of speculation that \u2014 although Branson has repeatedly said in interviews he doesn\u2019t view his competition with Bezos as a \u201crace\u201d \u2014 there was a bitter rivalry brewing behind the scenes. Both billionaires\u2019 flights ended without apparent issue, with the men emerging from their respective spacecraft outfitted in custom flight suits and beaming for the cameras. Adding to the spectacle, both flights also carried some notable crewmates for the billionaires.  Bezos was joined by 82-year-old Wally Funk, who famously trained for NASA\u2019s Mercury program in 1961 but never went to space, and then-18-year-old Oliver Daemen, the son of a wealthy businessman. The pair became the oldest and youngest people, respectively, ever to travel to space. (Funk\u2019s record was bested shortly after by the 90-year-old William Shatner.) Branson took with him Virgin Galactic executive Sirisha Bandla, who became only the second Indian-born woman to fly to space and back. Shaping up suborbital space Bezos\u2019 successful July launch catapulted the company into a busy rest of the year spent flying some high-profile figures as \u201chonorary guests\u201d \u2014 meaning they didn\u2019t have to pay for tickets. Shatner took his suborbital excursion in October, a feat widely celebrated by \u201cStar Trek\u201d fans that was followed by an Amazon video special on the flight. Michael Strahan and Laura Shepard Churchley, the daughter of famed astronaut Alan Shepard, flew in December. While Blue Origin was sending celebrities to space, Virgin Galactic faced significant delays. A report from the New Yorker revealed that warning lights had gone off in the cockpit during Branson\u2019s flight and the space plane had traveled outside its designated airspace for 41 seconds. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights pending a review, which concluded in September and gave Virgin Galactic the all-clear. Still, the company is delaying the start of commercial services, citing unrelated technology upgrades. Blue Origin, meanwhile, has faced its own controversies, though none that have indicated specific safety issues with its rocket or spacecraft. Rather, a group of 21 current and former employees co-signed a letter alleging the company operates a toxic work environment where \u201cprofessional dissent\u201d is \u201cactively stifled.\u201d Blue Origin responded to the claims by saying it has \u201cno tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind.\u201d Inspiration4 flies higher Though Musk does not have any apparent plans to join one of SpaceX\u2019s missions, his company continued to prove its technology chops. It drastically expanded its space-based internet service, Starlink, growing the constellation to include roughly 2,000 satellites. Its Dragon spacecraft also launched and returned astronauts to and from the International Space Station this year, and it topped the billionaire space tourism competition with a historic space tourism mission of its own. SpaceX\u2019s Inspiration4 mission, self-funded by billionaire payments platform CEO Jared Isaacman, sent Isaacman and three other people, none of whom were professional astronauts, on a three-day trip to orbit that traveled even higher than the International Space Station \u2014 higher than any human has traveled this century.  The passengers floated around the capsule, played songs, created works of art and kept in touch with ground control as their 13-foot-wide capsule whisked around the planet once about every 90 minutes, traveling at more than 17,500 miles per hour. The mission was intended to raise money for St. Jude Children\u2019s Hospital, a cause to which Isaacman donated $125 million and a public fundraiser fetched more than $118 million. Musk promised to donate $50 million. The whole thing went off (almost) without a hitch. Still, all the billionaires-in-space news generated plenty of backlash, including from high-profile figures such as the United Nations secretary general and Prince William. A \u201cdisease is spreading in our world today: a malady of mistrust,\u201d UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said in September, adding that includes \u201cbillionaires joyriding to space while millions go hungry on earth.\u201d Bezos v. Musk Playing out in the background of all the space tourism hype was a tense battle pitting the two wealthiest people on the planet against each other.  Bezos and Musk each want their own companies to be at the center of NASA\u2019s plans to return astronauts to the moon this decade. But after initially planning to bring on more than one contractor to build the lunar lander for the job, NASA later said it only had enough money for one \u2014 and it went with Musk\u2019s SpaceX. It awarded $2.9 billion to the company. Blue Origin fought that decision all year, saying NASA unfairly favored SpaceX. Meanwhile, the PR offensives and twitter battles began.  But a federal judge delivered a major blow to Blue Origin in November by ruling in favor of NASA and SpaceX. That put the future of the Bezos-owned company\u2019s plans to build a lunar lander into question. The ordeal highlighted how important government contracts are to the viability of the commercial space industry. Though these companies are private, their revenue streams still rely heavily on taxpayer money. And the battle over NASA\u2019s moon lander contract queued up what are sure to be more high-profile battles and an interesting few years ahead, as NASA and its contractors map out a path back to the lunar surface for the first time in half a century.",

            "text": "It\u2019s been another turbulent year for aviation.  As we end 2021, the thousands of holiday flights canceled due to the rampaging Omicron variant is delivering another hammering to an industry that\u2019s struggling with lost revenue, disruptive passengers, and being at the front line of both interpreting and enforcing governments\u2019 Covid regulations.  Here we look back at how CNN covered the biggest developments in aviation in the past 12 months.  Vaccine passports and mandates  It\u2019s hard to believe, but it\u2019s barely been a year since the UK\u2019s Margaret Keenan became in December 2020 the first person in the world to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. Today, more than eight billion have been administered.  The airline industry has had to adapt fast. While now we\u2019re getting used to all the digital documentation we need in order to fly, it was only in January that the United States introduced Covid testing and CNN was speculating on the ethics and practicality of introducing \u201cvaccine passports.\u201d In Asia-Pacific, the year began with concern over flight crews spreading the virus in otherwise tightly locked-down nations and Singapore Airlines was hoping to be the world\u2019s first fully vaccinated airline.  Attitudes to vaccine mandates for airline staff varied around the world, proving particularly contentious in the US, where Delta Air Lines and Southwest held out on making them compulsory for their workers.  Dr Anthony Fauci, top medical adviser to the White House, said in September that he supported a mandate for passengers too, but the travel industry was not on board and this remains a relatively uncommon measure worldwide. In October, Air New Zealand became one of the highest-profile airlines to announce a passenger mandate, which it will put into practice in February 2022.  The front line of enforcement Net industry losses for 2021 are expected to be close to $52 billion, but on top of these financial woes, the job was only getting tougher for those airline workers responsible for ferrying us through the skies. In the US, there were more reports of disruptive passenger incidents in 2021 than there were in the entire 31-year history of recording unruly behavior. Some flight attendants have even taken to self-defense training.  As well as battling with passengers who don\u2019t want to wear masks or who try to drink their own alcohol in-flight, airlines have had to keep up with fast-changing and often confusing Covid legislation introduced by governments.  In April, an Australian domestic flight was delayed so long quarantine rules changed while passengers were mid-air, while in December, Ghana\u2019s international airport introduced some of Africa\u2019s toughest regulations, fining airlines $3,500 for every unvaccinated passenger they flew into the country.  Busy planes and rising fares Cancellations, packed planes and ever increasing fares have become the \u201cnew normal\u201d for US air travel, CNN wrote in November. Operational meltdowns at Southwest and American Airlines were behind the recent cancellation of thousands of flights, but staffing shortages were also leading to overworked flight crews, while less choice in flights was leading to more expensive tickets.  One small upside for consumers in the Covid era is that globally many airlines have introduced and retained much greater flexibility when it comes to changing flights at short notice. However, flying is now often a stressful and expensive experience overall \u2013 not helped by \u201cfit to fly\u201d Covid testing still being a Wild West of private companies offering hugely varying levels of service and value for money.  Hellos, goodbyes and seeya laters  In February, Bombardier announced that it was ceasing production of the iconic Learjet plane, the small private jet plane that was for decades synonymous with high-end business travel.  At the opposite end of the size scale, the last ever Airbus A380 \u2013 the world\u2019s largest passenger airline \u2013 was delivered to its customer airline Emirates in December.  A380s, and scores of other planes, continued to be kept in storage by airlines due to lack of pandemic demand, although many reemerged as travel increased during the summer season. In the California desert, there was even a problem with parked-up A380s attracting rattlesnakes.  Italy\u2019s 74-year-old flag carrier airline Alitalia went bankrupt in August, with laid-off flight attendants stripping off in protest. The country\u2019s new blue-liveried national airline, ITA Airways, launched in October.  US airline JetBlue launched its first transatlantic service in August, between New York and London, and CNN\u2019s Richard Quest was on board.  And in China, the long-awaited Chengdu Tianfu International Airport opened in China. Constructed at a cost of about $10.8 billion, phase one of the mega-hub has the capacity to handle up to 60 million passengers per year.  The Belarus \u2018hijacking\u2019 In May, Ryanair flight FR4978 from Athens to Vilnius was forcibly diverted to Minsk, escorted by Belarusian fighter jets, in order for Belarusian authorities to arrest opposition activist Roman Protasevich and his Russian companion Sofia Sapega.  Three days after the incident, European airlines were formally stopped from flying over Belarusian airspace, effectively redrawing Europe\u2019s air map.  The carbon question At its annual meeting in October, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), rubber-stamped a resolution in support of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. With the focus on climate change during the COP26 summit in Scotland in November, CNN produced this long read on how close we are to guilt-free flying becoming a reality.  We also kept up with the latest developments in low-carbon alternative air travel, such as helium-fueled airships for inter-city trips.  Carbon-chugging pleasure trips were not by any means off the agenda in 2021, though. \u201cFlights to nowhere\u201d \u2013 round-trip sightseeing tours \u2013 were a fad, particularly in Asia-Pacific. A Qantas trip to see the supermoon and full lunar eclipse 40,000 feet above Australia sold out in May in 2.5 minutes.  The supersonic dream hit turbulence The long-held dream of a successor to Concorde became a little more distant when Aerion, one of the major players in the race to build a supersonic passenger jet, collapsed in May after running out of cash. It had been just months since it had announced grand plans for a fancy new global HQ to produce its family of jets.  Colorado-based Boom Supersonic, meanwhile, is pressing ahead with its plans to get the 1:3 scale prototype aircraft of its Overture jet up in the air. Its ambitions remain lofty: CEO Blake Scholl told CNN in May that the company\u2019s aim was to \u201cfly anywhere in the world in four hours for $100.\u201d  Atlanta-based Hermeus is working on an even-faster hypersonic passenger jet \u2013 that means speeds of Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound. That\u2019d get an aircraft from New York to London in just 90 minutes, making Concorde\u2019s three hours look sluggish.  Cabin evolution  In terms of new design innovations, Covid-proofing cabins was obviously a priority this year. Airbus designed an inflight Covid quarantine tent, while Japanese airline ANA introduced hands-free lavatory doors.  There were windowless cabin concepts and even underwater cabin concepts, and plenty of unusual and eye-catching airplane seat designs.  Looking towards 2022 and beyond, first class is disappearing from many airlines, with business class options instead becoming more luxurious.  In February, we declared premium economy the hottest airplane seat in 2021 and discussed how, in JetBlue\u2019s new Mint Studio, the seat revolution had created one of the biggest beds in the sky.  Superbusiness minisuites might be the future of luxury flying, we said in October, while in November we took deep dives into what business class might look like in 2025 and what the next few years could look like for the first class options that last the course.

            "text": "Chinese tech stocks got a big boost in Hong Kong on the last day of the year, but it\u2019s far from enough to make up for what has been a historically tumultuous time for the sector.  Shares in tech and internet giants Alibaba, Baidu and Bilibili \u2014 all of which also trade in New York \u2014 soared more than 8% on Friday, making them among the top performers during a shortened trading session in Hong Kong.  The Hang Seng TECH Index \u2014 which tracks the 30 largest tech firms that trade in the city \u2014 was up 3.57%, outperforming the broader benchmark Hang Seng Index\n            \n                (HSI), which rose 1.2%. The boost followed strong performances by Chinese tech companies Thursday on Wall Street. Electric automaker Nio\n            \n                (NIO) and Tencent Music Entertainment Group rose nearly 15%, while Alibaba\n            \n                (BABA) climbed 9.7%.  The year overall, though, has not been kind to Chinese tech. Alibaba\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares have shed nearly half their value in 2021. Tencent \u2014 which closed up 3% on Friday \u2014 has lost 19%. Baidu, which held a secondary listing in Hong Kong earlier this year, has lost 43% since that debut.  Chinese companies were heavily shaken by Beijing\u2019s sweeping regulatory crackdown on private businesses. The curbs on tech, finance, education and entertainment hammered stocks and at one point wiped out trillions of dollars worth of value from Chinese companies on global markets.  There are signs that Beijing may not want to rock the boat any further in the new year, as China\u2019s growth has slowed due to repeated Covid-19 outbreaks, supply chain disruptions, a power crunch, and the real estate crisis.  During a key economic meeting earlier this month, top leaders from the ruling Chinese Communist Party marked \u201cstability\u201d as their top priority for 2022. That\u2019s a huge pivot from last year\u2019s meeting, when \u201ccurbing the disorderly expansion of capital\u201d ruled the day. Even so, there are some big concerns on the horizon. Beijing took a couple of steps in recent days that show it is planning to tighten restrictions for Chinese companies that want to list overseas. And while the government won\u2019t ban them from trading abroad altogether, life might be getting a lot tougher for firms hoping to score more foreign investment. Last week, for example, regulators proposed that companies may be blocked from holding foreign initial public offerings if authorities deem them threats to national security, and added that companies may be required to divest some assets \u201cto eliminate or avoid the impact of overseas issuance and listing on national security.\u201d Washington has also enacted audit rules that could affect Chinese firms, a sign of continuing tensions between the United States and China \u2014 and one that could squeeze firms that still trade in New York.",

            "text": "Two of the world\u2019s biggest chipmakers are warning that Covid-19 outbreaks and stringent lockdowns in a major Chinese industrial hub are hampering their operations. Samsung and Micron said this week that they\u2019ve had to adjust operations in the northwestern city of Xi\u2019an, which is experiencing one of China\u2019s worst community outbreaks of the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities have responded by enacting sweeping measures with an intensity and on a scale rarely seen since Wuhan, the pandemic\u2019s original epicenter. Any slowdown in output from the city risks worsening the global chip shortage, an ongoing crisis that has limited the supply of everything from iPhones to new cars. Samsung said Wednesday that it had to \u201ctemporarily adjust operations\u201d in Xi\u2019an. The South Korean giant added that protecting its workers in the city remains its \u201ctop priority,\u201d and that it plans to take \u201call necessary measures, including leveraging our global manufacturing network, to ensure that our customers are not affected.\u201d Samsung has invested more than $10 billion in Xi\u2019an, and employs more than 3,300 people there. According to the Korea Economic Daily, output in the city accounts for over 40% of Samsung\u2019s total global production of NAND memory chips, a product found in smartphones, tablets and hard drives. Samsung declined to comment when asked by CNN Business for more information about how production in the city was being affected. American chipmaker Micron also said Wednesday that Xi\u2019an\u2019s lockdown could impact the production of its DRAM memory chips, which are used in computers, as the company has had to reduce its workforce at the site. Micron added that it is tapping its \u201cglobal supply chain, including our subcontractor partners,\u201d to meet customer demand, but warned that \u201cthere may be some near-term delays as we activate our network.\u201d \u201cNew or more stringent restrictions impacting our operations in Xi\u2019an may be increasingly difficult to mitigate,\u201d the company said. It stressed that safety of its team in the city is its \u201ctop priority\u201d, and it is taking measures ranging from physical distancing to on-site testing to minimize the risk of virus transmission. Xi\u2019an, an ancient city in Shaanxi province, has reported 1,117 total cases in the latest outbreak. It rolled out city-wide testing and placed its 13 million residents under a strict lockdown last week, closing schools, public venues and transportation. The lockdown is China\u2019s largest since Wuhan, which sealed off 11 million people. \u2013 Gawon Bae and CNN\u2019s Beijing bureau contributed to this report. ",

            "title": "Why a Mach 5 passenger plane is a crazy idea that might just work",
            "text": "Almost two decades since Concorde retired, interest around supersonic travel has been picking up pace, and several super-fast planes are under development. Airlines seem interested: United has already committed itself to offering supersonic routes as early as 2029. But what about hypersonic travel, which happens at speeds of Mach 5 \u2013 five times the speed of sound \u2013 and above? That would get an aircraft from New York to London in just 90 minutes, compared to about three hours for Concorde, and between six to seven hours for a regular passenger jet.  Is it even possible? Hermeus, an Atlanta-based startup whose goal is to develop hypersonic aircraft, believes so. It\u2019s already testing a new type of engine it says will eventually be capable of reaching Mach 5 (over 3,000 mph).  The engine is designed for a small, unmanned hypersonic aircraft Hermeus is currently creating for the US Air Force, but scaled to a bigger size, it will be able to power a passenger plane. That passenger plane is a long way away \u2013 Hermeus hopes to get it in the air for the first test flight before the decade is out, in 2029 \u2013 but because its technology has to be built almost entirely from the ground up, the company is already planning it out.  For a start, it will be much smaller than current airliners and even Concorde, which had a capacity of around 100 passengers.  \u201cTo help us size the aircraft, we basically built a business model for an airline,\u201d says AJ Piplica, CEO of Hermeus. \u201cWe focused on the business class and first class travelers, and then played around with some parameters such as speed and operating costs. What came out of that was an aircraft with a 20-passenger cabin,\u201d he adds. That\u2019s not far from the capacity of a large business jet, which means there will be just one class. \u201cWe expect it to be profitable at today\u2019s business class prices,\u201d says Piplica, with the caveat that it\u2019s hard to gauge how much people will be prepared to pay to fly five times faster, because \u201cyou can\u2019t really answer that question until there\u2019s a product out there and you have the real data.\u201d Faster than ever The range of the plane will be about 4,000 nautical miles, enough for transatlantic routes such as New York to Paris, but not for transpacific routes like LA to Tokyo, which would require a stopover.  Routes over land, such as New York to LA, are out of the question due to noise regulations: breaking the sound barrier comes with a loud boom, which usually must happen over water. To understand how daring the idea of a Mach 5 passenger plane is, it\u2019s useful to look at flight speed records.  The fastest any aircraft with an engine has ever flown is Mach 9.6 (about 6,800 mph), a record set in 2004 by the NASA X-43A \u2013 an unmanned aircraft measuring about 12 feet in length.  Because that flight only lasted a few seconds, the record for the longest sustained flight above Mach 5 belongs to the Boeing X-51, another unmanned experimental aircraft, which in 2013 flew for over three minutes at Mach 5.1 (about 3,400 mph). Both aircraft had to be launched from altitude by a B-52 bomber, and then brought up to speed by a rocket, highlighting the intricacies of these type of high-speed flights. For aircraft with humans on board, the current absolute speed record is Mach 6.7 (4,520 mph), set in 1967 by the X-15. It was basically a rocket with a seat, designed to achieve the record, and also had to be launched from altitude by a B-52.  For an air-breathing aircraft \u2013 that is, powered by jet engines rather than a rocket \u2013 capable of taking off and landing by itself, the speed record is \u201cjust\u201d Mach 3.3 (about 2,200 mph), set by the SR-71 Blackbird, a military spy plane, in 1976.  The top speed of Concorde, one of only two supersonic passenger planes to have flown commercially, was Mach 2.04 (1,350 mph). The proposed Hermeus passenger aircraft, therefore, would beat the current record for the fastest air-breathing plane by a large margin, and by flying for an extended time at Mach 5, it would outclass an achievement currently in the realm of unmanned experimental vehicles (of course, other aircraft might beat these records in the future before Hermeus does). \u2018Mature technologies\u2019 It\u2019s unsurprising, then, that the initial focus of the company is on the engine. Tests started in February 2020 for a new type of engine design, based on an existing model used in fighter aircraft and manufactured by General Electric.  It will be a hybrid of two traditional technologies: a turbojet, which is similar to what airliners use, and a ramjet, a type of engine that only works at supersonic speeds and above. Initially, the engine will power Quarterhorse, the sleek hypersonic drone that Hermeus is developing through a $60 million partnership with the US Air Force. Interestingly, when designing a jet engine to go faster, parts are removed rather than added. In a turbojet, the air enters from the front and is first compressed (to increase its energy potential) by rotating blades, then mixed with fuel and ignited. The resulting hot gas is blasted out through the back of the engine, pushing the plane forward.  Above Mach 3, however, there\u2019s no need to compress the air: It will compress itself upon entering the engine, simply by having to slow down so much. Therefore, for speeds above Mach 3 and up until Mach 6, an engine type called ramjet is often used \u2013 so called because it literally rams into the air. It has no moving parts, unlike turbojets, but it doesn\u2019t work at all at speeds below Mach 3. Hermeus will use its hybrid engine in turbojet mode when taking off and landing, as well as at subsonic speeds. Then, the engine will gradually reconfigure itself into a ramjet mode as it reaches Mach 3 and until Mach 5.  \u201cThe turbojet portion and the ramjet portion by themselves are mature technologies that we\u2019ve been using for 50 years. The trick is to put them together, so we designed our own architecture around an off-the-shelf turbojet engine and then built out from there,\u201d says Piplica. SpaceX inspiration There\u2019s a whole host of problems that Hermeus isn\u2019t even working on at the moment, such as what type of sustainable fuel to use \u2013 since consumption will be much higher than current jets \u2013 and the extreme temperatures that the fuselage of a hypersonic plane must be able to withstand. The speed of Concorde, which traveled at less than half the projected speed of Hermeus, was limited precisely by temperature, with windows and other internal surfaces becoming warm to the touch by the end of a flight.  The SR-71 Blackbird, on the other hand, had to be made of titanium, a rare metal that can withstand extreme heat, and the cockpit glass had to be made of quartz, with its exterior temperature reaching 600 F during a mission. In response to skepticism over Hermeus\u2019 chances of success and the need for potentially enormous amounts of funding, Piplica brings up an analogy with Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX.  \u201cI think people asked the same questions about the new space industry in the early days of SpaceX,\u201d he says. \u201cFolks looked at getting into orbit and said, this should be taking a billion dollars, but SpaceX did it for $90 million, with Falcon 1.\u201d Hermeus is planning to fund itself by developing various aircraft on the way to its passenger plane, similarly to SpaceX\u2019s development of its Falcon 1, Dragon, Falcon Heavy and Starship rockets, which ultimately serve a vision of interplanetary spaceflight while also generating revenue by working with NASA and commercial partners. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing like Hermeus, although many similar projects have come and gone in the past,\u201d says Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at Teal Group. \u201cIt never seems to work out. If they can magically create a hypersonic transport in the late 2030s, and the ticket price is in the business class range, then yes, that will be successful. But the odds of this happening are somewhere in the 1% range.\u201d If and when a hypersonic passenger plane will become a reality, what will it be like to fly on it? \u201cIt\u2019ll be pretty similar to Concorde,\u201d says Piplica. \u201cYou\u2019ll be accelerating for a longer period of time than you do on today\u2019s aircraft, where you feel pushed back in your seat for about 30 seconds to a minute or so.  \u201cThat experience will last for maybe 10 to 12 minutes. But once you\u2019re up at Mach 5, at 100,000 feet or so, it\u2019ll be a really smooth ride. There\u2019s not a lot of air traffic up there, and the atmosphere is relatively benign.\u201d ",

            "title": "Kenya Airways converted two 787 Dreamliners to carry cargo. Here\u2019s why",
            "text": "While passenger air travel has plummeted during the pandemic, demand for air cargo has surged. With e-commerce up and trucks often unable to cross borders, air freight became a global lifeline transporting medical supplies and personal protective equipment, as well as all kinds of everyday products.  According to the International Air Transport Association, in June this year African airlines increased freight volumes by 33.5% compared to the same period in 2019 \u2014 a bigger increase than anywhere else in the world.  CNN Business spoke with Allan Kilavuka, group managing director and CEO at Kenya Airways, from inside what he calls \u201cthe world\u2019s first cargo-converted Dreamliner 787,\u201d about how the airline has pivoted to meet this market shift. The following interview has been edited for clarity and length. How did Covid-19 impact your business? Kilavuka: Kenya Airways is one of the largest operators within Africa. Last year, like all other airlines, we suffered a significant drop in numbers. Before 2020, we were flying approximately 5 million passengers per year, 2019 being the record year. In 2020, which was the year that we suffered the pandemic, it dropped to about 1.8 million. So a significant drop and those numbers are reflected in our revenue numbers and subsequently our losses.  We also used to fly to 53 destinations across the world \u2014 that dropped to 41 but we hope to scale it back up a little bit more. Within Africa, we used to fly to over 40 destinations. That again has dropped to currently 36 destinations. Some we need to reactivate and see how that grows going forward.  How has the airline responded to the growing demand for air cargo? Kilavuka: Until now cargo has been about 10% of our business. We want to grow that to over 20% of our business, to double it within the next three to five years. And in order to do that, we need to increase capacity.    So right now we are sitting in the world\u2019s first cargo converted Dreamliner 787. This one we have dedicated to cargo \u2014  this and another one like this. We have at least 50 tons of cargo in this one \u201cpreighter\u201d [a passenger plane converted to carry freight] that helps transport mainly horticulture products to Europe, meat to the EU, crabs to China and so on. And then of course, to import certain items from Europe and Asia to Africa.  So cargo is extremely important in our strategic framework because of the role it will play in the bigger Kenya Airways business endeavors. Why? Because first of all, we think this is a good revenue stream for us. Secondly, it diversifies our portfolio a little bit more, so it safeguards our business. Thirdly, it supports businesses within Africa, which is what we\u2019re about. We\u2019re about sustainable development within Africa. So we want to play our part in helping and supporting businesses to export their products.  According to the African Airlines Association, domestic travel provided up to 61.5% of passenger flights for African airlines during the pandemic. How much of your focus is on boosting Africa and intra-Africa connectivity? Kilavuka: 60% of our traffic is within Africa. And we intend to continuously grow that because we are predominantly an African airline and that\u2019s how we want to position ourselves, because we believe there\u2019s a lot of potential on the continent. So there are several phases that we will undertake. First of all, it\u2019s to reinstate our original network. The ambition is to then expand into secondary cities, because we fly to most primary cities, to most capital cities. Now it\u2019s to look at players that will help us to go into secondary cities that make sense for the business.  Also, looking for opportunities for \u201cfifth freedom flights\u201d [flying between two foreign countries] \u2026 so that we can collect more traffic. This we can do either directly or through partnerships. Aside from cargo, how has the pandemic reshaped your business model? Kilavuka: Covid-19 has completely changed the way we look at things. The customer is demanding different things now. They are more concerned about health and hygiene, so we\u2019re taking extra measures to make them feel comfortable when it comes to that aspect of the business.  Secondly, they want a more flexible booking process and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done as well. They want more digital space and so on and so forth. So really, we\u2019re looking at the customer more and tailoring our product to match their needs.  There are also other revenue streams. We\u2019ve launched a drone initiative. We\u2019re working very hard at it. We think we have a very strong value proposition, especially because we have a lot of experience. We have over 44 years of experience in manned aircraft \u2014 we want to transfer that experience from manned aircraft to unmanned aircraft and offer a very valuable service to operators, not just within Kenya, but outside Kenya. We want to do a lot of surveillance, surveillance support, inspections and even light cargo deliveries. So we are working on commercializing this unit. We think that in five years\u2019 time, it will be a significant portion of our business.",

            "text": "The Covid-19 pandemic is far from over. But life in many ways has returned to something resembling normal for many. That\u2019s in large part because there are now multiple coronavirus vaccines, including one from Pfizer.  And that\u2019s one of the main reasons CNN Business has named Pfizer\n            \n                (PFE) CEO Albert Bourla as the CEO of the year. Bourla joins previous winners Marc Benioff of Salesforce\n            \n                (CRM), Target\n            \n                (TGT) CEO Brian Cornell and Chipotle\u2019s\n            \n                (CMG) Brian Niccol.  CNN Business considered several other influential CEOs for this year\u2019s honor, including Lisa Su of AMD\n            \n                (AMD), Ford\u2019s\n            \n                (F) Jim Farley, Marvin Ellison of Lowe\u2019s\n            \n                (LOW), David Solomon of Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS), Alphabet\u2019s\n            \n                (GOOGL) Sundar Pichai and, yes, Time Person of the Year Elon Musk of Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA)/SpaceX.  But Bourla was our choice for all that Pfizer has done in a year where Covid vaccines went mainstream (vaccine was even named word of the year by Merriam-Webster) and helped stabilize America\u2019s economy \u2014 and the world\u2019s for that matter. \u201cPfizer did a lot of good [for] humanity and we are very, very proud of it,\u201d Bourla said in an interview with CNN Business. \u201cNot only were we able to save so many lives \u2026 but we are enjoying high levels of corporate reputation right now. People like us.\u201d Hoping to get Covid pill approved in early 2022 Pfizer isn\u2019t the only company that has developed a vaccine. But the Big Pharma leader, even more so than its European partner BioNTech\n            \n                (BNTX) or rival vaccine developer Moderna\n            \n                (MRNA), has become synonymous with the fight against Covid.  The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first approved in the United States for 5- to 11-year old kids. But many parents of even younger children are now waiting to hear about when a vaccine might be approved for babies, toddlers and pre-schoolers.   Bourla said he understands the frustration of parents who are fully vaccinated but cannot get their youngest kids protected. \u201cWe\u2019re working very intensively on that to make sure we can bring a solution for that,\u201d Bourla said.  \u201cWe are looking at different doses, well below the doses that have been used [for adults and older kids.] We know that it will be safe. What we are looking to see is if that will protect them by giving the lower dose,\u201d he added.  But Pfizer announced after the interview with CNN Business took place that it is still evaluating whether three smaller doses of its vaccine will be effective for kids under 5 after finding two child-sized doses were not producing the expected immunity in 2- to 5-year-olds. In addition, Pfizer has developed a pill that could drastically reduce the risk of severe complications, hospitalization and death for people who contract the virus. The Food and Drug Administration announced following the interview with Bourla that it had approved Pfizer\u2019s Paxlovid oral treatment. But Bourla stressed to CNN Business that the pill is not meant to be a substitute for the vaccine.  Ready to launch an Omicron-specific vaccine if needed The recent rise of the Omicron variant has created concerns around the globe about the efficacy of the current vaccines. But Bourla told CNN Business that he believes its and BioNTech\u2019s vaccine will control Omicron \u201cquite well,\u201d especially if people have received two doses and the booster.  He conceded, however, that it is possible Pfizer will need to launch a new vaccine to specifically target Omicron or any other future variants. Bourla said Pfizer is already developing a shot aimed at Omicron, and that he believes it could be tested and submitted to regulators for approval by March.  If Pfizer needs to produce Omicron-specific shots, that will not slow the manufacturing of the existing vaccine, Bourla said.  \u201cWe are aiming for a four billion [dose] annual manufacturing capacity of our current vaccine. And if we have to switch between the two, the old and the new, we still will make four billion. We don\u2019t expect that we will lose any volume,\u201d he said. Bourla also acknowledged that there are cynics who question whether Pfizer is just trying to make as much money as possible from the vaccine.  After all, Pfizer said in its latest earnings release in November that it generated $13 billion in revenue from the vaccine in the third quarter and that it now expects $36 billion in revenue from it for the full year.    Bourla told CNN Business that it is charging poorer, developing nations less for the vaccine than it does to wealthier countries. But cost isn\u2019t the only challenge. He said some countries, such as those in remote parts of Africa, are \u201clacking basic infrastructure.\u201d  \u201cThey don\u2019t have centers to vaccinate people, particularly in remote places. They do not have enough nurses,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes they are lacking syringes, sometimes they are lacking refrigerators so that they can store the vaccine. So this is unfortunately the situation.\u201d  Bourla is hopeful the World Health Organization and the public-private vaccine alliance Gavi will be able to help resolve some of these issues. He also said the company is looking into drone delivery more to ensure that people get the vaccine more quickly. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to find ourselves on the right [side] of history,\u201d he said. Bourla also continued to stress that the vaccine is safe and that the only way for life to return to normal is for people to get the shots. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why next year will not be a normal year if we do the simple things that are available for us,\u201d Bourla said.  \u201cIf we have very big numbers of people that don\u2019t want to do a third dose or don\u2019t want to vaccinate at all, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d More to Pfizer than the Covid vaccine Pfizer and Bourla aren\u2019t resting on their laurels. The company has also been at the forefront of developing many other promising blockbuster drugs such as blood thinner Eliquis, breast cancer treatment Ibrance and rheumatoid arthritis pill Xeljanz, as well as the Prevnar family of pneumonia vaccines. Bourla is fully aware that for a drug company to remain successful, it has to have even more promising drugs in the pipeline.  Several of Pfizer\u2019s current top sellers are due to lose patent protection in the next few years. Once they expire, that opens the door for cheaper generic drugs to compete with them. That\u2019s a big reason why Pfizer announced plans for a nearly $7 billion deal earlier in December to acquire Arena Pharmaceuticals\n            \n                (ARNA), a company developing drugs to treat immuno-inflammatory diseases. The acquisition came just one month after Pfizer completed a more than $2 billion purchase of cancer drug maker Trillium Therapeutics. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging to multitask,\u201d Bourla said. \u201cBut let\u2019s not forget what else we are working on. There are so many medicines for cancer, for other infectious diseases, for cardiovascular diseases, for other diseases.\u201d \u201cWe are heavily invested right now in cancer,\u201d Bourla added. \u201cThe biggest percentage of our R&D investment goes into oncology right now.\u201d Investors have rewarded Pfizer, which ironically enough was booted from the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2020 just a few months before its vaccine was approved. Shares are up nearly 65% in 2021 \u2014 more than any Dow stock \u2014 and are not far from a record high. ",

The impacts of allowing 5G to deploy, \u201care massive, and come at a time when our industry is still struggling from the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d the CEOs said.  he Federal Aviation Administration announced a new rule earlier this month that forbids pilots from using auto-landing and other certain flight systems at low altitudes where 5G wireless signals could interfere with onboard instruments that measure a plane\u2019s distance to the ground.

            "title": "Nike is trying to outrun supply chain problems",
            "text": "Plenty of people want to buy Nike clothes and sneakers. But nearly two years into the coronavirus pandemic, supply chain issues mean the company is struggling to meet that demand and grow its business. Nike sales increased just 1% to $11.4 billion in the quarter ended November 30, the US footwear giant reported after the closing bell on Monday. That was better than analysts expected, even as sales dropped sharply in some markets. Crucial markets: Revenue from Greater China plummeted by nearly a quarter, with sneaker sales down by 50%, Nike executives told analysts on Monday. Revenue also declined in Asia Pacific and Latin America.  One big culprit was factory closures related to the pandemic in Vietnam, where Nike was forced to cancel production of 130 million items. Store closures in China also hampered sales. \u201cThe results this quarter in China were absolutely \u2014 were overwhelmingly impacted by supply disruptions from Vietnam,\u201d said Nike chief financial officer Matthew Friend. \u201cWe also had to navigate through local measures that were put in place to reduce the spread of Covid \u2026 those were clearly the two biggest drivers that impacted our performance this quarter,\u201d he added. Nike\n            \n                (NKE) is far from the only company to be negatively affected by supply chain issues. Auto production has been limited by a shortage of computer chips, while shipping delays have caused problems for a range of industries.  Nike executives are confident that the worst of the company\u2019s supply chain snafus have been resolved. Its factories in Vietnam have reopened, and production is ramping up.  \u201cRelative to where we were 90 days ago, we\u2019re increasingly confident that inventory supply will normalize and that we\u2019ll be in a position to meet the incredible demand that we\u2019re seeing across the marketplace,\u201d said Friend. There is one looming risk to that optimistic outlook: Omicron. The fast-spreading coronavirus variant is ripping through major economies around the world, forcing some governments to impose fresh restrictions. Omicron is now the dominant strain in the United States, accounting for over 73% of new cases, according to the CDC. Friend told analysts that the environment is \u201cuncertain\u201d and \u201cvolatile,\u201d but said Nike was better prepared to deal with potential disruption to its operations. \u201cI think we\u2019re better positioned than we\u2019ve ever been, and we\u2019re two-plus years into navigating through the challenges and the complexities of the volatility as it relates to the pandemic,\u201d Friend said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to watch it closely like everyone is,\u201d he added. Not so fast: The variant could keep the pressure on supply chains well into the new year, dashing hopes for a return to normalcy later in 2022.  \u201cThe recovery in global industrial production will gain considerable momentum later in the year as component shortages and cost pressures ease,\u201d economists at Oxford Economics wrote recently. Auto production will start a slow recovery, according to Oxford Economics. And shipping cost pressures are expected to ease gradually over the course of the year. Omicron could yet deliver a major setback. Oxford Economics said the variant is a \u201csignificant\u201d risk to its outlook in the near-term.  US castoff lands mega listing China Mobile is ending the year with a bang, reports my CNN Business colleague Michelle Toh. The Chinese telecom giant announced Tuesday that it wants to raise as much as 56 billion yuan ($8.8 billion) on the Shanghai stock exchange after it was forced to quit Wall Street in January. In a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange, where its stock also trades, the company said it planned to issue between 845.7 million and 972.6 million new shares for nearly 57.6 yuan (about $9) apiece. That would make it one of the world\u2019s biggest equity offerings this year, according to Refinitiv. The massive Shanghai debut makes for a splashy homecoming for China Mobile. The company did not specify a listing date in its prospectus, but said it planned to apply to start trading \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d Earlier this year, China Mobile, along with two other Chinese state-run telecom firms \u2014 China Telecom and China Unicom \u2014 were kicked off the New York Stock Exchange, after the Trump administration barred American investment in companies with ties to the Chinese military. Elon\u2019s huge tax bill Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk says his tax bill this year will be $11 billion, and he\u2019s probably right: The filings he has made with the Securities and Exchange Commission about his recent stock trades back up that massive number. That would be a massive change from some recent years. An investigation by ProPublica found that Musk, and fellow billionaires such as Jeff Bezos and Michael Bloomberg, legally paid zero in income taxes in 2018. How did zero become $11 billion? My CNN Business colleague Chris Isidore has the details: Musk doesn\u2019t earn a cash salary or bonus. He\u2019s instead been paid through stock options, giving him the right to buy shares of Tesla at the market price when the options are issued, but likely well below their value at the time they are exercised. Musk received 25.5 million split-adjusted options in 2012, and had 22.9 million of those options vest over subsequent years as Tesla hit certain operational and financial targets. But he didn\u2019t have to pay taxes on those options until he used them to buy shares. Since that block of options is due to expire in August 2022, Musk finally started the process of turning them into stock in early November.  When he exercises the options, the value of the newly purchased shares are taxed as income \u2014 a 40.8% rate for someone in Musk\u2019s tax bracket. And that is where the huge tax bill comes from. Up next General Mills and Rite Aid report earnings before the bell.  Also today: Earnings from BlackBerry after the closing bell. Coming tomorrow: Earnings from CarMax.",

            "title": "20 astonishing facts about the A380 superjumbo",
            "text": "Beloved by passengers for its spaciousness and comfort, but disliked by airlines because of its running costs, the Airbus A380 has already entered its sunset years, even though it debuted commercially just 14 years ago.  Its final chapter was brought into sharper focus this week, when Airbus delivered the last ever A380 ever made to its new owners, Emirates, ending 18 years of the aircraft\u2019s production.   The superjumbo was conceived at a time when larger planes carrying hundreds of passengers between hubs were an attractive proposition, but by the time it started flying, a different business model \u2013 smaller planes connecting smaller airports \u2013 had taken over in the aviation industry. The biggest airliner ever produced, however, has amassed a following and even though a significant portion of the fleet won\u2019t survive the pandemic, news of the airplane getting back into the air have electrified those who specifically look out for it when making flight reservations.  Now several airlines \u2013 including Emirates, British Airways and Singapore \u2013 are offering long-haul flights on the superjumbo again. Whether you plan to catch a flight on an A380 while you still have the chance or not, here\u2019s our pick of the 20 most interesting facts about this unique aircraft. 1. Bigger than ever As the only full-length double decker passenger aircraft ever built, the A380 is so large that it could, in theory, carry a maximum of 853 passengers if all seats were economy class. However, no airline has ever fitted out an A380 like that: the highest recorded capacity is 615 people in a two-class (economy + business) configuration. 2. Wires for miles Each A380 contains over 300 miles of electrical cables and wiring, and installing them proved so challenging that some of the initial delays with the production of the aircraft were blamed specifically on the wiring. In 2009, Airbus streamlined operations by speeding up the installation of the brackets that hold up the wiring \u2013 there are up to 80,000 in each aircraft. 3. Turbulent air The size and weight of the superjumbo can cause problems to smaller planes closely following it \u2013 a phenomenon known as \u201cwake turbulence.\u201d In 2017, a small private jet flipped in the air when it crossed paths with an A380. Recent guidelines suggest that light aircraft should wait four minutes before taking off or landing on the same runway that was just used by an A380. 4. A serious paint job It takes 950 gallons of paint to cover the entire 38,000-square-feet surface of an A380. A regular layer of paint adds 1,400 lbs of weight to the plane. The process usually takes about two weeks. 5. No need to pack light The cargo hold of an A380 can carry up to 3,000 suitcases, and two loading belts \u2013 one at the front and one at the back \u2013 can be used simultaneously to speed up the process. 6. A true globalist Each A380 is made of 4 million individual components, produced by 1,500 companies from 30 different countries. They all used to converge via road, air and sea to Toulouse, in the south of France, where the final aircraft was assembled.  7. A chance of showers A fully stocked bar with onyx countertops on the upper deck is a relatively common sight on the A380. Less so are the fully functional showers fitted into the First Class suites on Emirates and Ethiad A380s, or the full-size double bed that Singapore introduced in its Double Suites. 8. More room than a basketball court With its full-length double deck, the A380 offers almost 6,000 square feet of usable floor space, about 40% more than the second largest airliner, the Boeing 747-8. 9. Loved by Emirates  By far the largest operator of the A380 is Dubai-based Emirates, with 123 orders, followed by Singapore Airlines with 24. In total, 14 airlines have ordered and flown the A380. When Emirates canceled an order for 39 A380s in early 2019, Airbus decided to cease production of the aircraft altogether, by the end of 2021. 10. You can own a piece of one While it has only just taken delivery of the last A380 ever made, Emirates has already retired the first one it acquired 14 years ago and handed it over to be recycled and turned into furniture items. Among items listed for pre-order at the Dubai Airshow in November were coffee tables made out of wheels, clocks made from wing fuel panels and the airplane\u2019s entire 24-meter-tall tail. Also up for grabs was the plane\u2019s fancy upper deck bar. 11. The secret compartment With a cockpit crew of three and up to 21 flight attendants, the A380 has the largest crews of any airliner. The galley area has enough room for five people to work simultaneously, and crew members can rest in a \u201csecret\u201d area found in the third deck (the cargo one at the bottom), complete with bunk beds and a private restroom. 12. Not for everyone The A380, due to its size, can\u2019t be operated at all airports and many had to undertake modifications to be able to handle the superjumbo. In Munich, special hangar doors needed to be built to accommodate the aircraft\u2019s tail. Airbus says that 140 airports worldwide are compatible with the plane, and over 400 can accept it in case of an emergency landing.  13. The longest flight Emirates operates the A380\u2019s longest scheduled passenger flight: Dubai to Auckland, 8,800 miles and over 17 hours in the air. In 2019, Qantas flew one of its A380s back to base in Sydney from Dresden, Germany, after refurbishment. The plane was empty and flew for over 18 hours and about 10,000 miles. 14. The shortest flight Singapore Airlines has announced it will offer the new shortest A380 flight in the world: a quick hop of only 180 miles between Changi Airport in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. Previously, Emirates held this record with a flight from Dubai to Muscat, Oman, which clocked in at around 210 miles.  15. The cargo version that never was When Airbus launched the A380 in December 2000, it offered a cargo version called A380F, designed to compete with the equivalent cargo-only models of the Boeing 747. UPS and FedEx both initially placed orders for the plane, but after its release was delayed they canceled them, leading to the cancellation of the A380F program itself. 16. Flappy wings During takeoff, the A380\u2019s wings flutter so much that they flex upwards by as much as 13 feet. That\u2019s a lot, but not as much as aircraft with a higher amount of composite materials, such as the Boeing 787, whose wings can flap by as much as 25 feet. 17. Jumbo depreciation The list price of an Airbus A380 was about $450 million, without factoring in discounts, which are common. The current fleet value, however, has plummeted: one estimate says that a 2005 model is now worth just $77 million, and a like-new A380 built in 2019 just $276 million. 18. Two per wing The plane\u2019s four engines are both one of its most distinctive factors and a drawback, as they require more fuel than twin-engined jets. They are made by either Rolls-Royce in the UK or Engine Alliance in the United States, and can lift the airplane\u2019s maximum takeoff weight of 650 tonnes to cruising altitude in 15 minutes.  19. No US buyers One of the main reasons why the A380 was never a commercial success is the fact that not a single US airline ever bought the plane. Major European carriers such as Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa did, but in small numbers. By the time the A380 was available, US carriers had already moved away from jumbo planes and towards more fuel-efficient, twin-engined aircraft such as the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350. 20. A partial comeback The pandemic hit the aviation industry hard, and the A380 harder. Lufthansa and Air France never put their A380s back into service after they were grounded, deciding to retire their entire fleets instead, while Qatar sent half its fleet to permanent storage. On the flip side, Qantas, British Airways, Emirates, Qatar, Singapore, All Nippon and Korean Air have all announced that they are restarting A380 service.",

            "text": "Almost everything you buy has traveled along some of the millions of miles of networks that make up the world\u2019s supply chains. Most of the time, the logistics involved in making this possible are invisible and kept behind the scenes. But these days, supply chains are front and center as companies cope with a pandemic-induced shift in consumer behavior from experiences to goods that has left supply chains strained.  A lot of attention has focused on ports and other infrastructure, as well as shortages of trucks and labor. Those are important bottlenecks that need further investments to be fixed, but they are symptomatic of a deeper problem.  What the global supply chain really suffers from \u2014 and what is behind most of the problems today \u2014 is a lack of technology. The current technology being used has left companies and supply chain providers with little cargo visibility, a lack of supply chain integration, and hardly any ability to anticipate and alleviate problems. Giving the supply chain its own \u201ccloud moment,\u201d where it is completely rethought and upgraded, will improve life, not just for businesses but also for their customers. Global supply chains have long been complex, modular and siloed networks that focused on keeping up with capacity demands and optimizing for cost, efficiency and scale. They are designed to work in a certain way and can withstand known challenges, but when tested by unexpected events like a pandemic, they are incredibly fragile. They are built for a world in balance. And when imbalances occur, which unfortunately is often the case, they are simply not resilient enough to withstand disruptions and delays. The pandemic has accelerated and magnified the challenges that already existed.  Today, logistics professionals across all types of companies need to work through a myriad of different suppliers, platforms, systems and solutions to source and ship products to customers. Just think about the ecommerce growth we are currently seeing, and what that means for companies. A clothing company that was used to distributing merchandise to their stores in the past now has to be able to ship directly to customers across the globe or to one of their retail locations for same-day pickup, and then also prepare for the possible returns of orders.  Here\u2019s how technology can help to ease these challenges.  Reduce complexity Automakers are a perfect example of how certain industries could simplify their operations and reduce redundancies. The world produced almost 80 million cars last year, and a typical car consists of as many as 30,000 individual parts \u2014 from the screws to the windshield. And to add to the complexity, each car company has invested heavily into building its own version of a supply chain to maintain and manage its operations.  Instead, these companies should be tapping into a global infrastructure solution that could meet their needs. It\u2019s not so different from the cloud revolution a decade ago where companies realized that it was not good business to invest in building their own cloud, but rather partner with the global cloud providers that had the necessary scale.  Digitize  Supply chains are still operated in a very siloed, manual way. A single container can require up to 100 document exchanges per trip, which can add to shipping costs.  Digitizing these interactions by creating a platform or infrastructure where they can be more easily processed will ensure that goods move more effectively through customs and across borders, and comply with regulations.  Integrate  One of my biggest global customers recently told me, \u2018I just don\u2019t know where my stuff is right now.\u2019 That\u2019s not an infrastructure problem \u2014 that\u2019s a data visibility problem.   The movement of goods is subject to many handovers, which can create structural weaknesses in the supply chain. Like in a relay race, they represent an opportunity for failure, mistakes or delays. To get to better outcomes, companies are leveraging digitization to integrate data, products and services, which will give them greater visibility.   One of the biggest supply chain issues in the world is food loss, and ensuring a connected, reliable cold chain to keep food fresh and cool. At Maersk, we\u2019re moving over half a million containers of fruit and vegetables every year. This requires refrigerated containers and cold storage facilities to keep the produce at a perfect temperature to avoid food loss.  By combining our tracking abilities with internet-enabled sensor devices, we\u2019ve made it possible for our customers who are transporting bananas to monitor, adjust and get automatic alerts on the condition of their produce \u2014 including temperature, humidity and CO2 levels \u2014 from an app on their phone. The result is that bananas can travel farther and arrive in perfect condition so they will be ripe by the time you put them in your fruit bowl.  There is so much to be optimistic about integrating data, systems and technologies and applying them to tomorrow\u2019s challenges. This will allow us to better connect and simplify the world\u2019s supply chains, which will make life easier and more affordable for both companies and consumers. ",

            "text": "The last Airbus A380 ever made has been delivered to Emirates, marking the end of an era for the superjumbo that was once touted as the future of aviation until airlines cast it aside for smaller aircraft. The huge double-deck aircraft, call sign A6-EVS, arrived in London on Thursday and will soon be entering into commercial service.    Beloved by many pilots and travelers, the A380\u2019s days have been numbered since 2019 when Airbus announced plans to cease its production in the face of disappointing demand for its flagship airplane. Still, the age of the superjumbo isn\u2019t entirely over \u2013 the last A380 is also the 123rd A380 to join Emirates, while other carriers, including British Airways and Singapore Airlines, also still operate superjumbos in their fleet. The appeal of the superjumbo The A380 is the largest mass-produced passenger aircraft ever developed. Its hefty size \u2013 it can accommodate up to 853 passengers in roomy surroundings \u2013 and quiet inflight experience are among the reasons it\u2019s become so popular among passengers. However the aircraft was never a hit with airlines in the way Airbus hoped. Costly to run, the A380 is usually only viable on long-distance routes. It\u2019s also less environmentally friendly than more modern, smaller aircraft models. Over 2020 and 2021, the pandemic\u2019s impact on the aviation industry saw most of the world\u2019s A380 fleet grounded. Lufthansa\u2019s decision to park its A380 turned into the German carrier permanently retiring the superjumbos, while AirFrance also retired its last A380.  Still, airlines seem to recognize the A380\u2019s enduring popularity, and it\u2019s been slowly reintroduced to some carriers\u2019 schedules, following a pandemic pause. As Siva Govindasamy, Singapore Airlines\u2019 global public affairs head put it in October, when announcing plans to reinstate the aircraft: \u201cSome people just book the A380 specifically to fly on it.\u201d And while Airbus won\u2019t be making any more superjumbos, travelers should be able to to enjoy the A380 experience for years to come. Upon delivery of the new aircraft in London, Tim Clark, Emirates\u2019 president, said in a statement that the A380 will \u201cremain Emirates\u2019 flagship product for the coming years\u201d calling the aircraft \u201ca vital pillar of our network plans.\u201d",

            "text": "Delta CEO Ed Bastian thinks wearing masks on airplanes is a good idea. The day after Southwest CEO Gary Kelly suggested at a Senate hearing that wearing masks on a plane was not necessary, Bastian said he doesn\u2019t agree. He said masks would be necessary for the foreseeable future. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I agree with Gary\u2019s remarks, particularly as we see Omicron continue to enter into our country,\u201d Bastian said in an interview on CNBC. \u201cMasks are going to be important as a safeguard for a while yet.\u201d Kelly and two other airline CEOs \u2013 Doug Parker of American Airlines and Scott Kirby of United \u2013 testified Wednesday about the financial support that the federal government provided to the US airline industry in 2020 and 2021. But Kelly was asked by the ranking Republican on the committee, Roger Wicker, if he thought that masks were still needed on planes. \u201cI think the case is very strong that masks don\u2019t add much, if anything, in the air cabin environment.  It is very safe and very high quality compared to any other indoor setting,\u201d said Kelly. Parker appeared at the hearing to agree with Kelly, saying, \u201cI concur. An aircraft is the safest place you can be. It\u2019s true of all of our aircraft \u2014 they all have the same HEPA filters and air flow.\u201d But after the hearing American Airlines walked back Parker\u2019s remarks, saying that his concurrence with Kelly was on the point about the quality of the air in the aircraft cabin, not mask requirements. Early in the pandemic, all the airlines kept the middle seats open to provide social distancing on planes. It was an easy thing to do when there were relatively few passengers on planes. But, as demand for flying returned, most quickly started filling middle seats once again. Delta kept the middle seats open far longer than its rivals, not booking passengers into the middle seats until May 1, 2021. Whether or not the airlines agree or disagree with the masks, they are required by US Department of Transportation rules, not airlines\u2019 individual preferences. And they are unlikely to be lifted any time soon. The DOT did not respond to a request for comment on Kelly\u2019s remarks, which were made late Wednesday afternoon. Bastian was appearing on CNBC to discuss new financial guidance that the airline had given that it now expects to report a profit in the fourth quarter. That came as a bit of a surprise: Delta\n            \n                (DAL) had previously forecast it would lose money in the quarter. Delta\n            \n                (DAL) was the only US airline to report a profit in the third quarter. At the time it forecast the fourth quarter loss in October, it said it expected rising fuel prices would tip it back to a loss.  \u201cWe had a really strong close to the year,\u201d Bastian said. \u201cThe holiday bookings for Christmas and the New Year\u2019s holidays, are coming in very strong. A lot of people are getting back out and seeing people. The combination of stronger revenue and some moderation in fuel prices will result in a profit.\u201d  Revenue will still be down from the fourth quarter of 2019, mostly because the airline isn\u2019t flying as complete a schedule as it did before the pandemic. But he said the revenue brought in for every mile flown will be up from 2019 levels. Although Delta is looking for a strong close to the year, Bastian cautioned that with the rise of Omicron, bookings will probably fall sharply in early 2022. The early part of the year is one of the weakest for leisure travel and many businesses could be pulling back plans to reopen offices and authorize travel in the face of rising Omicron cases, and more restrictions on international travel.",

            "title": "How to find the world\u2019s roomiest airplane seats",
            "text": "One of the greatest luxuries when we fly is space: the space to stretch out, relax, work and sleep while flying seven miles above the Earth at nearly the speed of sound.  These days, that\u2019s international business class, with fully-flat beds longer than most people are tall. But some are roomier than others. So which airline will give you the biggest bang for your buck? To be clear, we\u2019re not talking about international first class suites here, the sort of space that can involve a separate bed and reclining (or even rotating) chair. Those are, in almost every case, so big that only a giant would need to worry about legroom or elbowroom. We\u2019re talking about long-haul business class, and here the amount of space can differ greatly: on the same Boeing 777 widebody airplane, you can find eight seats across (United Airlines\u2019 domestic configuration) or four seats across (All Nippon Airways\u2019 latest layout), and a variety of seats in between.  As a rule, the fewer seats there are in a row, the more space you\u2019ll have, so that\u2019s one key thing to look out for. We asked Jason Rabinowitz, head of airline research at ATPCO, an airline-owned company that maintains a database of almost every airplane seat and cabin flying, for more information about which seats are the roomiest. \u201cA whole host of factors can make a premium airline seat feel \u2018big\u2019 or \u2018small.\u2019 Different aircraft fuselage sizes will actually make it necessary for an airline to slightly slim down a seat than a passenger may be used to,\u201d he says. \u201cSeveral airlines have had to slightly slim down seats originally installed on the Boeing 777 for the Airbus A350.\u201d 80+ inches Space in economy is usually based on both how wide your seat is and how much space there is between any given point on your seat and that same point on the seat in front. That\u2019s called \u201cseat pitch,\u201d and it\u2019s a good comparator for legroom, but in business class, where seats usually overlap, pitch isn\u2019t a great measurement. ATPCO\u2019s data measures bed length, but not seat width, which can be complicated to measure for a number of reasons: unlike economy class, there\u2019s no \u201cbetween the armrests\u201d standard measurement, for a start. But there are a few dozen combinations of airline and airplane where you\u2019ll find more than 80 inches in bed length \u2013 that\u2019s 6 feet, 8 inches or 203 centimeters in length. It\u2019s worth noting that these seats aren\u2019t as wide as a bed all the way down, though \u2013 these measurements are from tip to toe, and to maximize space onboard most seats will taper above the shoulder and below the waist in a kind of teardrop shape. The biggest seats stretch out to a whopping 87 inches in bed length \u2013 that\u2019s 7 feet, 3 inches or 221 centimeters, which is tall enough for almost everyone.  These 87-inch seats can be found on board three airlines\u2019 planes: Boeing 777s belonging to Air France, Garuda Indonesia and Thai Airways. That\u2019s not to say that every 777 belonging to these airlines has this size of seat, though, so make sure that you look carefully when booking. Moving down the list come 84-inch seats (that\u2019s 7 feet exactly or 213 centimeters) aboard South American carrier LATAM\u2019s Boeing 777-300ER, and then 82-inch (6 feet 10 inches, 208 centimeters) seats from Garuda Indonesia (on its newer A330-300 and -900neo aircraft) and Oman Air (on its two kinds of A330). Rounding out the 80-plus club comes a whole stack of airlines with seats at 80 inches (6 feet 8 inches or 203 centimeters). Again, these won\u2019t be every one of the airplanes for each airline, so keep an eye out when you\u2019re picking your flight. The not-so-short list \u2022 Air Canada: 777, 787 and A330 \u2022 Delta: A330-200 and A330-300 \u2022 Gulf Air: 787-9 \u2022 Malaysia Airlines: A330-200 \u2022 Oman Air: 787-8 and 787-9 \u2022 Qantas: A380 (2019 refit version) and 787-9 \u2022 Qatar Airways: A350 (Qsuites and previous seat) and A380 \u2022 Royal Air Maroc: 787 \u2022 Virgin Atlantic: A350 and 787-9 So how do you find the roomiest seats when booking? If you can find flights with those planes, you can look forward to a spacious flight. Otherwise, here are a few suggestions. Make sure you\u2019re going fully flat: almost all international business class sections these days feature fully flat beds, rather than the \u201csloping sleeper\u201d or sleeperette angled lie-flat seats from the 1990s and early 2000s. Look for seats without a neighbor, also known as \u201call aisle access,\u201d \u201cdirect aisle access\u201d or \u201cpod\u201d seats. These seats mean whoever\u2019s in the window seat doesn\u2019t need to climb over the aisle, and there\u2019s usually extra elbow room too.  The roomiest sizes of these seats \u2013 and, indeed, most business class seats \u2013 tend to come on the larger planes like Boeing\u2019s 777 and Airbus\u2019 A350, rather than the smaller Boeing 787 and Airbus A330. And don\u2019t be afraid to have a good look at the cabin pictures.  \u201cThe overall cabin design may also create a feeling of openness,\u201d says ATPCO\u2019s Rabinowitz. \u201cFor instance, some airlines have removed the overhead bins from the center seating section in premium cabins, giving those seats a much more open feeling.  \u201cBetter lighting and more refined sidewalls and cabin finishings also work to give the appearance of a more open, spacious cabin.\u201d Top image credit: Virgin Atlantic",

The decision is a big blow to the American aircraft maker, and a major win for its European rival. The airline said Thursday that it plans to buy 40 Airbus planes, including 20 A321XLR jets and 20 A220 carriers. The company will also have the right to buy another 94 aircraft over the next 10 years \u201cas its existing Boeing 737-800s and 717s are gradually phased out.\u201d The order is subject to board approval, and is expected to be finalized by June next year, the airline added.  \u201cThis was a very tough choice to make,\u201d said CEO Alan Joyce said in a statement. \u201cEach option delivered on our core requirements around safety, capability and emissions reductions. But when you multiply even small benefits in areas like range or cost across this many aircraft and over the 20 years they\u2019ll be in the fleet, Airbus was the right choice as preferred tenderer.\u201d The company expects aircraft to start arriving by the middle of 2023 with deliveries to be spread over the next decade, Qantas added. Qantas has shifted away from Boeing\n            \n                (BA) in recent years, including by picking Airbus as its partner to fly the world\u2019s longest passenger routes.  The news comes as a blow to the American aircraft maker, which is still trying to rehabilitate its image after the 737 Max crisis. Max planes were grounded worldwide for 20 months in 2019 and 2020, following two crashes that killed 346 people. It was approved to fly passengers in the United States late last year and is now in service in most of the world except China, a key market for air travel.  Like airlines worldwide, Qantas\n            \n                (QABSY) has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Joyce said in another statement that capacity dropped significantly, especially as Australia spent much of the year with extremely tight border controls and local lockdowns. But he also expected demand to pick up over the Christmas period and into early next year as more restrictions ease.  \u201cWe\u2019ve significantly reduced our cost base which improves our ability to recover,\u201d he added.
