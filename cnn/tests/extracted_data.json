[{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@context": "https://schema.org", "articleBody": "Boeing on Monday scrambled to address safety and quality concerns about its planes ahead of a whistleblower hearing in the Senate on Wednesday. A briefing for journalists came in the wake of reports last week that the Federal Aviation Administration is looking into allegations raised by Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour that Boeing took shortcuts when manufacturing its 777 and 787 Dreamliner jets and that risk of catastrophic failure will increase as the planes age. Salehpour is set to be the key witness at a Wednesday hearing of the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations. Boeing, which has seen its once pristine reputation for safety and engineering quality badly diminished recently, held the briefing Monday to try to pre-emptively answer Salehpour, although the executives said they wouldn\u2019t comment directly on his allegations. Boeing has faced more than five years of questions about the safety and quality of its commercial jets following two fatal crashes of a different model, the 737 Max, in 2018 and 2019. Those crashes killed 346 people and led to a 20-month grounding of that jet. It came under renewed scrutiny earlier this year after a door plug blew out on an 737 Max flight by Alaska Airlines on January 5, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet. That has sparked investigations and allegations that some Boeing employees felt reluctant to raise questions about the safety of the planes they are building or inspecting for fear of retaliation. Boeing cites increased tips, vigorous tests While Salehpour charged last week that Boeing employees are scared to speak up about problems at factories, Boeing says the number of employee tips about quality and safety issues \u2014 as well as improvement ideas \u2014 has \u201cexploded\u201d since the Alaska Air incident. January and February submissions already equal the number of submissions for all of 2023, according to the company. \u201cWe\u2019re continually encouraging it,\u201d said Lisa Fahl, Boeing\u2019s vice president of engineering for Airplane Programs at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, during Monday\u2019s briefing. Fahl and Steve Chisholm, Boeing\u2019s vice president and chief engineer for mechanical and structural engineering, told media members Monday that Boeing\u2019s planes face stress tests designed to replicate far more flights taking place than they ever will in the real world. The average 787 does 600 flights a year, according to Chisholm, and the tests Boeing put the planes through simulated 165,000 flights. And they said real world inspections on the planes now in service show even after as many as 16 years of use, no evidence of fatigue in parts of the plane now facing questions. Chisholm said the planes were designed to pass tests replicating far more stress over many more flights than they are subjected to in the real world. \u201cFrankly we\u2019re not surprised by lack of fatigue findings,\u201d he said. Salehpour\u2019s complaint alleges crews assembling the plane failed to properly fill tiny gaps when joining separately manufactured parts of the fuselage.\u00a0That puts more wear on the plane, shortening its lifespan and risking \u201ccatastrophic\u201d failure, Salehpour\u2019s attorneys alleged. Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration have admitted that some of the planes did have problems with the gaps between parts of the fuselages that were wider than the standards set by Boeing. The delivered planes were allowed to continue to fly, but the non-conformance with Boeing\u2019s standards led to long periods in recent years during which the aircraft maker had to halt deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner. But Chisholm said the inspections done after those questions were raised have shown no problems in actual operations of the planes. He said some of the standards for the size of the gaps were changed in the wake of the inspections. Fahl described the original standards of a gap of only 5/1000th of an inch, as equal to the width of a human hair or two pieces of paper. Chisholm said the original standards were \u201chyper-conservative\u201d ones set by Boeing, not by regulators. \u201cIt was very difficult to meet that standard. There are areas where we\u2019ve increased what is allowable. We\u2019re [still] talking about very tight alignments,\u201d he said.", "articleSection": ["business"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Chris Isidore", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/chris-isidore"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pete Muntean", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/pete-muntean"}], "dateModified": "2024-04-15T22:00:25.924Z", "description": "Boeing on Monday scrambled to address safety and quality concerns about its planes ahead of a whistleblower hearing in the Senate on Wednesday.", "headline": "Boeing defends its planes\u2019 safety ahead of whistleblower hearing", "image": [{"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap22167025314973.jpg?c=original", "caption": "A the rear fuselage section of a 777 freighter is seen at Boeing's Everett Production Facility Wednesday, June 15, 2022, in Everett, Wash.", "sourceOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "AP licensed"}, "width": "2000", "height": "1333", "creditText": "Jennifer Buchanan/The Seattle Times/Pool/AP", "dateCreated": "2022-06-15T04:00:00.000Z"}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap22167025314973.jpg?c=original", "caption": "The rear fuselage section of a 777 freighter is seen at Boeing's Everett, Washington, factory in this 2022 file photo.", "sourceOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "AP licensed"}, "width": "2000", "height": "1333", "creditText": "Jennifer Buchanan/The Seattle Times/Pool/AP", "dateCreated": "2022-06-15T04:00:00.000Z"}], "thumbnailUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap22167025314973.jpg?c=original", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@context": "https://schema.org", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/15/business/boeing-defends-planes-safety/index.html", "dateModified": "2024-04-15T22:00:25.924Z", "inLanguage": "en", "additionalType": "article_leaf", "publisher": {"@type": "NewsMediaOrganization", "name": "CNN", "logo": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61", "foundingDate": "1980-06-01", "url": "https://www.cnn.com", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/cnn/", "https://twitter.com/CNN", "https://www.instagram.com/cnn/", "https://www.youtube.com/cnn"]}, "name": "Boeing defends its planes\u2019 safety ahead of whistleblower hearing", "headline": "Boeing defends its planes\u2019 safety ahead of whistleblower hearing", "description": "Boeing on Monday scrambled to address safety and quality concerns about its planes ahead of a whistleblower hearing in the Senate on Wednesday.", "datePublished": "2024-04-15T22:00:25.924Z"}, "publisher": {"@type": "NewsMediaOrganization", "name": "CNN", "logo": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61", "foundingDate": "1980-06-01", "url": "https://www.cnn.com", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/cnn/", "https://twitter.com/CNN", "https://www.instagram.com/cnn/", "https://www.youtube.com/cnn"]}, "timeRequired": "P0Y0M0DT0H2M59S", "wordCount": 674, "datePublished": "2024-04-15T22:00:25.924Z", "isAccessibleForFree": false, "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": false, "cssSelector": ".article__content"}}, {"@type": "NewsArticle", "@context": "https://schema.org", "articleBody": "Globe-trotters are on the move again in a big way, boosting the rankings of a handful of international aviation hubs on the list of the world\u2019s busiest airports. There\u2019s no change at the top of the list. The No. 1 airport for passenger volume in 2023, Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson International, has held that position every year \u2014 except pandemic-walloped 2020 \u2014 for more than two decades. But for the first time, Dubai takes the No. 2 ranking, according to Airports Council International\u2019s preliminary rankings for 2023, released on Monday. \u201cDubai served around 87 million passengers in 2023. That is a year-to-year increase of 31%, and that is 1% higher than 2019. And they connected 262 destinations around 104 countries to 102 international carriers,\u201d said Luis Felipe de Oliveira, ACI World\u2019s director general. The airport\u2019s jump up from No. 5 in 2022 is representative of a big growth area in aviation, with industry expansion in emerging and developing economies in the Middle East and Asia Pacific expected at more than twice the rate of advanced economies in the decades to come, de Oliveira said. But Atlanta doesn\u2019t have too much to worry about for now. With 104.7 million passengers in 2023, Dubai\u2019s not nipping at its heels just yet. That figure is still about 5% below ATL\u2019s pre-pandemic 2019 passenger total, but de Oliveira said ACI expects Atlanta to serve about 110 million passengers in 2024 \u2013 bringing the airport back to 2019 passenger levels. Globally, passenger traffic in 2023 grew by 27% from 2022 to reach nearly 94% of 2019 results, with domestic travel rebounding more quickly from the pandemic \u2014 growing by 20% from 2022 to reach almost 97% of 2019 levels. The world\u2019s largest domestic market, the United States, had four more airports \u2013 all with significant domestic passenger shares \u2013 in the top 10 in 2023: Dallas/Fort Worth (No. 3), Denver (No. 6), Los Angeles (No. 8) and Chicago O\u2019Hare (No. 9). International travel is driving recovery But in 2023, it was the international market that drove recovery, growing about 37% to reach about 90% of 2019 figures. And while Dubai is the No. 2 airport for overall traffic, it\u2019s No. 1 in the world for international passengers. Plus, it has evolved into a destination in its own right. London Heathrow, another strong international player, jumped up from No. 8 in 2022 to No. 4 last year. But it was Tokyo Haneda in Japan that made the biggest leap \u2013 from No. 16 to No. 5, thanks largely to Japan\u2019s reopening. It\u2019s a welcome indicator that Asia\u2019s passenger numbers are getting back on track, de Oliveira said. Istanbul\u2019s airport held steady at No. 7, and Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi dropped one spot from No. 9 in 2022 to No. 10 last year. India, with an enormous population that\u2019s increasingly connected by air, is an example of growth in the industry\u2019s capillary network in different parts of the world. \u201cIn the US, you have a very good capillarity in the system \u2013 the small, medium and big airports connecting with each other. We don\u2019t have that in many parts of the world,\u201d de Oliveira said. But it\u2019s growing rapidly in India, he said, with Air India and IndiGo buying hundreds of aircraft and the government investing in the country\u2019s more than 140 airports. The 2023 global total passengers figure is close to 8.5 billion, according to ACI\u2019s preliminary figures. Smoothing out rough air The global outlook is \u201cvery positive\u201d for continued growth. \u201cIn 2020, we lost like 20 years of development of the aviation sector in one year, so we are recovering very fast considering that,\u201d de Oliveira said. In 2023, the system was able to cope better with surging demand than it did earlier in the pandemic rebound, he said, although there are still some pressure points, including a shortage of US air traffic controllers. There\u2019s also very high demand for new, more efficient aircraft to reduce fuel costs and increase sustainability. In addition to the most recent production slowdowns precipitated by issues with Boeing aircraft, supply chain slowdowns have contributed to a backlog of orders. The supply chain issues have improved, but the backlog is still significant, de Oliveira said. Aircraft delivery delays could affect growth if airlines aren\u2019t able to cope with demand, but he added that airlines are consequently likely to delay retiring less efficient planes to continue to meet strong demand. Everything that happened as a result of the pandemic has underlined the importance of being ready for future issues, de Oliveira said, and ACI is working with member airports to become more resilient. \u201cThat is always with the focus on the passenger \u2026 We have this ecosystem, if the ecosystem doesn\u2019t work well, the passenger suffers.\u201d World\u2019s top 10 busiest airports for passenger traffic in 2023 1.\u00a0 Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta, Georgia (ATL): \u00a0104.7 million passengers; up 11.7% from 2022 2.\u00a0 Dubai, United Arab Emirates (DXB): \u00a087 million passengers; up 31.7% from 2022 3.\u00a0 Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas (DFW): 81.8 million passengers; up 11.4% from 2022 4.\u00a0 London Heathrow, United Kingdom (LHR): 79.2 million passengers; up 28.5% from 2022 5.\u00a0 Tokyo Haneda, Japan (HND): 78.7 million passengers; up 55.1% from 2022 6.\u00a0 Denver, Colorado (DEN): 77.8 million passengers; up 12.3% from 2022 7.\u00a0 Istanbul, Turkey (IST): 76 million passengers; up 18.3% from 2022 8.\u00a0 Los Angeles, California (LAX): 75.1 million passengers; up 13.8% from 2022 9.\u00a0 Chicago O\u2019Hare, Illinois (ORD): 73.9 million passengers; up 8.1% from 2022 10.

It was a project that forever altered the course of spaceflight with its triumphs \u2014 and its tragic failures. Deemed an \u201cengineering marvel,\u201d the first of five winged orbiters \u2014 the space shuttle Columbia \u2014 made its inaugural flight in 1981. Twenty-two years and 28 trips to space later, the same shuttle broke apart during its final return to Earth, killing all seven crew members on board. The tragedy spelled the end for the US space agency\u2019s transformative shuttle program. And its memory continues to reverberate in the halls of NASA today, leaving a lasting mark on its consideration of safety. \u201cHuman history teaches us that in exploration, after accidents like this occur, we can learn from them and further reduce risk, although we must honestly admit that risks can never be eliminated,\u201d said then-NASA Administrator Sean O\u2019Keefe, who ran the agency from 2001 to 2004, in a speech before members of Congress shortly after the Columbia disaster. After the shuttle program was retired, no US astronaut would travel to space on an American-made rocket for nearly a decade. Reimagining rocketry The space shuttle project was forged in the optimism of NASA\u2019s Apollo program, which landed 12 astronauts on the surface of the moon and bested America\u2019s Soviet rivals during the Cold War. Apollo was, however, extraordinarily expensive: NASA spent $25.8 billion\u00a0(or more than $200 billion when adjusted for inflation) \u2014 according to a cost analysis from space policy expert Casey Dreier of the nonprofit Planetary Society. With financial constraints on the horizon, by the mid-1970s, engineers within NASA were building an entirely new means of space transportation. Apollo used towering rockets and small capsules \u2014 destined to be flown just once \u2014 that would plunge back home from space and parachute to an ocean landing. The space shuttle concept was a remarkable pivot: Reusable, winged orbiters would take off strapped to rockets, sail through Earth\u2019s orbit and glide to an airplane-esque runway landing. From there, the shuttle could be refurbished and flown again, theoretically driving down the cost of each mission. Shuttle\u2019s legacy Over the course of three decades, NASA\u2019s fleet of space shuttles flew 135 missions \u2014 launching and repairing satellites, building a permanent home for astronauts with the International Space Station and commissioning the revolutionary Hubble Space Telescope. But the shuttle program, which ended in 2011, never lived up to the US space agency\u2019s initial vision. Each shuttle launch cost about $1.5 billion on average, according to a 2018 paper from a researcher at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center. That\u2019s hundreds of millions of dollars more than what the space agency had hoped for at the program\u2019s outset, even when adjusted for inflation. Long delays and technical setbacks also beleaguered its missions. \u201cEvery single mission that I was there for was scrubbed, rescheduled, delayed because something wasn\u2019t exactly right,\u201d said O\u2019Keefe, the former NASA administrator, in a new CNN documentary series, \u201cSpace Shuttle Columbia: The Final Flight.\u201d And two disasters \u2014 the Challenger explosion in 1986 and the loss of Columbia in 2003 \u2014 cost the lives of 14 astronauts. The Columbia disaster: Looking back On the morning of February 1, 2003, the Columbia orbiter was heading home from a 16-day mission to space. The seven-person crew on board had carried out dozens of science experiments while in orbit, and the astronauts were slated to land at 9:16 a.m. ET in Florida. NASA engineers knew that a piece of foam \u2014 used to insulate the shuttle\u2019s large, orange fuel tank \u2014 had broken off during the January 16 launch, striking the Columbia orbiter. The space agency\u2019s stance, however, was that the lightweight insulation material likely didn\u2019t cause significant harm. Some foam had broken off on earlier missions and caused slight damage, but it was deemed an \u201caccepted flight risk,\u201d according to the official Columbia accident investigation report. It was later revealed, however, that concerns about the foam\u2019s impact were swept under the rug by NASA management, according to previous reporting and \u201cSpace Shuttle Columbia: The Final Flight.\u201d \u201cI was very upset and angry and disappointed with my engineering organizations, top to bottom,\u201d said Rodney Rocha, a chief NASA shuttle engineer, in the new series. The astronauts even received an email from mission control alerting them about the foam strike on the eighth day of their mission, reassuring them there was no reason for alarm, according to NASA. But the assumption was wrong. An investigation later revealed the dislodged foam had struck Columbia\u2019s left wing during launch, damaging the spacecraft\u2019s thermal protection system. The issue didn\u2019t affect crew members while they spent more than two weeks in space. But heat protection is crucial for the dangerous return home. As with every mission that returns from orbit, the vehicle had to dive back into the thick of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere while still traveling at more than 17,000 miles per hour (27,359 kilometers per hour). The pressure and friction on a spacecraft can heat up the exterior to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,649 degrees Celsius). Reentry proved too much for the damaged Columbia shuttle. As the vehicle approached its destination, crossing over New Mexico into Texas, the orbiter began to disintegrate \u2014 visibly shedding chunks of debris. At 8:59 a.m. ET, ground controllers lost contact with the crew. The final dispatch came from mission commander Rick Husband, who said, \u201cRoger, uh,\u201d before he was cut off. At 9 a.m., onlookers saw Columbia explode over East Texas and watched in horror as it showered the area with debris. The realities of risk Two decades later, the Columbia tragedy and the broader shuttle program offer crucial perspective about the perils and triumphs of spaceflight. NASA entered the era confidently, anticipating that the odds of a shuttle being destroyed during flight were around 1 in 100,000. The space agency reevaluated that risk, estimating after the Challenger disaster that the\u00a0shuttle had carried\u00a0a 1 in 100 chance of disaster. \u201cIf somebody told me, \u2018Hey, you can go on this roller coaster ride, and there\u2019s a 1 in 100 chance that you\u2019ll die. Well, there\u2019s no chance in the world \u2014 no chance in hell \u2014 I would do that,\u201d US Sen.

The bank\u2019s first-quarter revenue increased by 9% from the year before, to $41.9 billion. That\u2019s more than analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected. Earnings per share came in at $4.44, also higher than the $4.17 estimated by FactSet. Still, CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors that trouble could lie ahead. \u201cMany economic indicators continue to be favorable. However, looking ahead, we remain alert to a number of significant uncertain forces,\u201d he wrote in a press release Friday. Dimon cited growing geopolitical tensions and \u201cpersistent inflationary pressures, which may likely continue,\u201d as ongoing worries. \u201cWe do not know how these factors will play out, but we must prepare the Firm for a wide range of potential environments to ensure that we can consistently be there for clients,\u201d he said. On a call with reporters Friday morning, Dimon said American consumers still have excess savings, stocks are higher and unemployment is low. \u201cEven if we go into recession, they\u2019re in pretty good shape,\u201d he noted. But he also said that lower-income earners are quickly running out of extra money. The bank is beginning to see some cracks in the subprime auto loan market. Dimon, calling in from an investment banking conference in Florida, told reporters that he believes market pricing is likely \u201ctoo happy\u201d right now and that the chance of a bad outcome is \u201chigher than other people think.\u201d But, Dimon said, \u201cthe important thing isn\u2019t the economy \u2014 whether we have a mild recession or soft landing or something like that,\u201d he said, referring to a scenario where inflation is vanquished without raising unemployment levels. What\u2019s important, he said, \u201cis the future of the free world,\u201d referring to Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. \u201cIt could be determinative on what happens to the global economy if oil and gas prices go too high,\u201d Dimon said. The impact of \u2018higher for longer\u2019 rates JPMorgan Chase acquired most of First Republic Bank\u2019s assets last May after the San Francisco-based regional bank was seized by the government. That acquisition added billions of dollars in loans to the bank\u2019s balance sheet, boosting its income from interest. JPMorgan Chase reported that average loans had increased 16% from the year before, mostly because of First Republic. Net interest income, or NII, from those loans (that\u2019s the money a bank earns from loans minus the interest it pays on deposits) increased by 11% to $23.2 billion. But the bank also said that NII could fall short of Wall Street expectations for the year. Net interest income has been a key metric for analysts this quarter as they look to see how banks react to elevated interest rates by the Federal Reserve. Banks, including JPMorgan, have brought in record profits, boosted by NII, as the central bank raised interest rates. JPMorgan Chase also said on Friday that it would take a one-time $725 million charge by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation related to the mess that Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank left in the wake of their collapses last spring. It was large banks that mostly footed that bill. Shares of the bank fell by 4.3% in morning trading but are up 45% over the last 12 months. Mixed earnings Separately, investment giant BlackRock reported that its assets under management swelled to a record $10.5 trillion during the first quarter. The company also beat top- and bottom-line expectations. Wells Fargo, which also reported its first-quarter earnings Friday, topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations but saw an 8% decline in net interest income from the prior year. The company also noted a $284 million expense during the first quarter related to the FDIC\u2019s special assessment. Citigroup reported net income of $3.4 billion in the first quarter, or $1.58 a share, outpacing analysts\u2019 expectations for $1.18 a share, according to FactSet. CEO Jane Fraser said Friday the bank finished its organizational restructuring, which included layoffs, last month. The company saw $225 million in restructuring charges during the first quarter, largely driven by severance and other corporate reshuffling costs. Citi also noted a $251 million expense related to the FDIC\u2019s cleanup of the regional bank collapses last year.

An accountant by training, Calhoun has prioritized fiscal discipline over his four years at the helm, tightening the belt to free up cash flow and put the company on better financial footing. But when it comes to living the CEO lifestyle, that thriftiness goes right out the window. See here: Boeing reported in a regulatory filing that four top executives, including Calhoun, got an extra half-million dollars worth of personal private jet travel on the company\u2019s dime that had previously been improperly recorded as business travel, my colleague Chris Isidore writes.  That oopsie was discovered in an internal review, which was prompted by a\u00a0Wall Street Journal investigation\u00a0last year into Boeing executives\u2019 private jet travel, the paper reported Thursday. To be clear: Boeing requires Calhoun, who is stepping down later this year, to use its private jets for business and personal travel for security reasons. And that\u2019s pretty standard. If he\u2019s flying from the company\u2019s headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, to its production facility outside Seattle, that\u2019s generally considered a perk of the job. But when a CEO uses the company jet for a family vacation, that usually counts as taxable income. The IRS is a stickler about these things, and it recently announced it would be cracking down on executives who have been illegally writing off personal trips as business expenses. There is no evidence anyone from Boeing was doing that, but the crackdown signals that it\u2019s happening with some regularity in Corporate America. Over the last three years, Calhoun racked up $979,000 in personal air travel, according to the company. Boeing did not have any comment beyond the information in the filing. Why it matters In all the chatter about Boeing\u2019s disastrous start to 2024, we\u2019ve barely had time to talk about the crisis looming on the horizon: a potential strike by its largest labor union. A 10-year contract covering 30,000 Seattle-area machinists\u00a0 expires September 12. Negotiations started last month \u2014 delayed to give the company some slack while dealing with multiple federal probes into the January 5 door-plug blowout. The machinists are seeking a 40% pay bump over three years and a seat on the board of directors. It\u2019s going to be pretty awkward for Boeing leadership to try to nickel and dime the people who build the planes while lavishing Calhoun with a nearly $33 million payday last year (a 45% bump from 2022), and teeing up his $45 million retirement package, and batting down questions about the boss bouncing between his two homes, neither of which are located near the company\u2019s headquarters. \u201cWith what\u2019s going on these days, we are oftentimes the last line of defense, and we have to save this company from itself,\u201d the union\u2019s president, Jon Holden, told the FT last week.", "articleSection": ["business", "investing"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Allison Morrow", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/allison-morrow"}], "dateModified": "2024-04-12T12:00:26.669Z", "description": "When it comes to building planes, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun is all about streamlining costs.

The letter was signed by industry lobby group\u00a0Airlines for America \u2014 whose members include American Airlines (AAL), Delta (DAL) and United (UAL) \u2014 and other unions representing aviation workers, including the Air Line Pilots Association. \u201cIf the growth of the Chinese aviation market is allowed to continue unchecked and without concern for equality of access in the market, flights will continue to be relinquished to Chinese carriers at the expense of US workers and businesses,\u201d it added. In February, Washington said it will allow Chinese airlines to further increase their direct passenger flights to the United States, in an effort to gradually restore aviation services that had been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Chinese carriers were given approval by US officials to make 50 weekly round trips to and from the United States, up from 35, from March 31. But the increased number is still only a fraction of the more than 150 weekly round trips allowed by each side before curbs were imposed in early 2020.

The \u201canti-competitive disadvantage\u201d with China worsened in 2022, the letter said, when the Asian country\u2019s airlines continued to access Russian airspace, while US carriers stopped using it as a result of Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February of that year.

The increased spending estimate, disclosed in a recent company filing, brought the total cost to the company for the personal air travel for the four to $1.9 million since 2021. Besides Calhoun, the other executives include CFO Brian West; Stan Deal, who recently departed as CEO of its commercial airplane unit; and Theodore Colbert, the CEO of its defense, space and security business. The disclosure comes as the plane maker is facing additional scrutiny for a series of safety incidents, including a midair blowout of part of a fuselage in January, which prompted a number of investigations into the company\u2019s practices, an executive shakeup and promises that the company will turn itself around. The air travel is part of what are known as perquisites, or perks granted the executives, which also include ground transportation, lodging and meals during personal travel. And for air travel, the reported costs include only the incremental costs to Boeing, such as fuel, crew travel expenses, on-board meals, landing fees, and parking costs. It does not include the cost of the corporate jets or the salaries of the flight crew, which Boeing said it would be paying whether or not the executives made the personal trips. The cost of personal air travel by Calhoun alone came to $979,000 during those three years. The upward adjustment means that Boeing spent at least $734,000 in 2022 and $306,000 in 2021 on these executives\u2019 personal air travel, according to figures provided. Some of the amounts for air travel for Colbert and Deal are not broken out for the earlier years, despite the increased cost now being reported for those years for all four. And 2023 personal air travel costs for the four came to $872,000. Boeing has been struggling financially for five years, since fatal crashes of its 737 Max in late 2018 and early 2019 resulted in a 20-month grounding of its best-selling plane. It was also hit by the pandemic, which caused a near-halt in air travel for months and deep losses at most airlines that buy its planes. Since the start of the grounding in 2019 the company has reported adjusted losses totaling more than $31 billion, and losses are projected to continue going forward. Company policy requires its CEO to fly on its fleet of private jets, or leased aircraft, even when flying for personal reasons for security reasons, and the other top executives are permitted to do so as well when aircraft are available. But an internal company review of some of the flights that had previously been classified as business travel determined the flights should be classified as personal travel under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, according to the filing. That review resulted in a newly reported cost of personal travel that was $546,000 more in 2022 and 2021 than previously disclosed. That review appears to have been conducted after a September 2023 article in the Wall Street Journal detailing the perks of top Boeing executives, including the liberal use of the aircraft to travel from homes far from company headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia. The new filing came Friday evening. Boeing did not have any comment on the costs of the executives\u2019 personal air travel beyond the information in the filing. That Friday filing also disclosed that Calhoun\u2019s total compensation for 2023 came to $32.8 million, up 45% from his 2022 compensation. He did decline his annual incentive bonus, which would have paid him an additional $2.8 million, after a Boeing 737 Max plane being flown by Alaska Airlines on January 5 had a door plug blow out, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. The incident sparked a series of federal investigations, a temporary grounding, executive ousters and renewed questions about the safety and quality of Boeing planes. Last month, Calhoun announced he would step down as CEO of the embattled aircraft maker by the end of the year. At the same time, it was announced that Deal would retire from his position atop Boeing Commercial Airplanes, effective immediately.", "articleSection": ["business"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Chris Isidore", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/chris-isidore"}], "dateModified": "2024-04-11T18:56:46.580Z", "description": "Embattled airplane maker Boeing disclosed it lavished an additional $546,000 on the cost of personal air travel in recent years for four top executives, including CEO Dave Calhoun, who announced last month that he will leave the company by the end of the year.", "headline": "Boeing spent $500,000 more than it previously disclosed on personal private jet trips for top executives", "image": [{"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1953488771.jpg?c=original", "caption": "Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun is departing a meeting with Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) in the Hart Senate Office Building, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on January 25, 2024, as Boeing is dealing with the fallout of multiple recent safety mishaps, including a door blowing out mid-flight.", "width": "5141", "height": "3429", "creditText": "Aaron Schwartz/NurPhoto/Getty Images", "dateCreated": "2024-01-25T05:00:00.000Z"}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1953488771.jpg?c=original", "caption": "Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun on Capitol Hill in January, as Boeing dealt with the fallout of multiple recent safety mishaps, including a door plug blowing out mid-flight.", "width": "5141", "height": "3429", "creditText": "Aaron Schwartz/NurPhoto/Getty Images", "dateCreated": "2024-01-25T05:00:00.000Z"}], "thumbnailUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1953488771.jpg?c=original", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@context": "https://schema.org", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/11/business/boeing-executives-personal-air-travel-costs/index.html", "dateModified": "2024-04-11T18:56:46.580Z", "inLanguage": "en", "additionalType": "article_leaf", "publisher": {"@type": "NewsMediaOrganization", "name": "CNN", "logo": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61", "foundingDate": "1980-06-01", "url": "https://www.cnn.com", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/cnn/", "https://twitter.com/CNN", "https://www.instagram.com/cnn/", "https://www.youtube.com/cnn"]}, "name": "Boeing spent $500,000 more than it previously disclosed on personal private jet trips for top executives", "headline": "Boeing spent $500,000 more than it previously disclosed on personal private jet trips for top executives", "description": "Embattled airplane maker Boeing disclosed it lavished an additional $546,000 on the cost of personal air travel in recent years for four top executives, including CEO Dave Calhoun, who announced last month that he will leave the company by the end of the year.", "datePublished": "2024-04-11T18:56:46.580Z"}, "publisher": {"@type": "NewsMediaOrganization", "name": "CNN", "logo": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61", "foundingDate": "1980-06-01", "url": "https://www.cnn.com", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/cnn/", "https://twitter.com/CNN", "https://www.instagram.com/cnn/", "https://www.youtube.com/cnn"]}, "timeRequired": "P0Y0M0DT0H3M10S", "wordCount": 714, "datePublished": "2024-04-11T18:56:46.580Z", "isAccessibleForFree": false, "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": false, "cssSelector": ".article__content"}}, {"@type": "NewsArticle", "@context": "https://schema.org", "articleBody": "It\u2019s been a brutal six years for Boeing, with two fatal jet crashes kicking off a series of safety crises \u2014 and raising concerns about the quality and safety of the planes rolling off its assembly lines. As Boeing scrambles to repair its reputation, some critics and shareholders are asking: Why not move headquarters away from the shadow of Washington, D.C., \ufeffand back home to its roots in Seattle? But Boeing has now made clear: We are not interested. An individual Boeing stockholder, Walter Ryan, wanted to put the question of a move up for a vote during the company\u2019s May 17 annual shareholder meeting. He filed his proposal in October for the shareholder vote, which would have been non-binding \u2014 but in February, Boeing went to the Securities and Exchange Commission, ultimately winning approval to block the vote. Ryan, who owns 10,000 shares of Boeing stock, lives in Las Vegas and has never been to Seattle. But he believes that if Boeing is to fix its current quality and safety problems, the company\u2019s top management should be back in Seattle \u2014 near where most of its commercial aircraft are still manufactured. \u201cI think they need some hands-on overseeing, and by som\ufeffebody who has skin in the game,\u201d Ryan told CNN. Boeing\u2019s corporate offices had been in Seattle from its founding in 1916 until it relocated to Chicago in 2001.\ufeff Then in 2022, Boeing corporate moved again \u2014 this time to Arlington, Virginia, near the Pentagon and across the river from Capitol Hill. Most manufacturing, however, remains more than 2,300 miles away in Seattle. \u201cThey want to be next to government,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIs that a sound idea? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d It isn\u2019t only shareholders like Ryan who believe a return to Seattle would benefit Boeing. \u201cPart of it would be symbolic,\u201d said Shem Malmquist, a Boeing 777 pilot and instructor of aviation safety at Florida Tech. \u201cBut it\u2019s also going to be better culturally. In the end, the closer the top management is to the production and what\u2019s going on and the engineers, the better.\u201d Boeing\u2019s response In his proposal he wanted presented to shareholders, Ryan said the corporate move from Seattle and separation from the core manufacturing business resulted in major issues related to \u201cengineering and quality problems, and Boeing\u2019s historic credibility,\u201d \u2014 concerns he said are now foremost \u201cin the minds of both travelers and shareholders.\u201d Ryan wrote the proposal even before a headline-grabbing incident in January, when the door panel of a Boeing 737 Max blew off in the middle of an Alaska Airlines flight, later found to be because the aircraft left the factory missing crucial bolts needed to keep it in place. Boeing\u2019s attorneys argued to the SEC that this isn\u2019t an appropriate issue for shareholder vote: \u201cThe proposal seeks to \u2018micro-manage\u2019 the company by probing too deeply into matters of a complex nature upon which shareholders, as a group, would not be in a position to make an informed judgment.\u201d Further, Boeing\u2019s attorneys dismissed the premise of Ryan\u2019s argument, calling it \u201can unsupported theory that certain manufacturing issues experienced by Boeing would have been avoided simply because the company\u2019s headquarters were located in a particular city, emphasizing, among other things, management\u2019s ability to walk the factory floor.\u201d The SEC agreed that Boeing it did not need to put Ryan\u2019s proposal on its proxy statement, which was released Friday. Boeing told CNN it did not have any comment beyond those included in its filing to the agency. Ryan said he believes his proposal \u2014 which would have allowed shareholders only to \u201crecommend\u201d a move back to Seattle, not mandate it \u2014 would have won had it been put up for a vote. \u201cThat\u2019s why I sent it in. I thought it would pass, and thought it would be a good idea,\u201d he told CNN. Speaking broadly, however, even shareholder proposals that are put to a vote are not likely to pass \u2014 especially recently. According to Institutional Shareholder Services, which tracks shareholder votes, only 5.4% of votes held in 2023 on shareholder proposals received majority support. That\u2019s down sharply from 12.6% in 2022, and 19.5% in 2021.", "articleSection": ["business"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Chris Isidore", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/chris-isidore"}], "dateModified": "2024-04-11T11:00:29.197Z", "description": "Some Boeing critics argue it would better chances of fixing its problems if it returned to Seattle.

Nineteen hours into one of the longest military missions\u00a0the US carries out, the crew had already\u00a0contended with\u00a0communications issues and had to make pinpoint fuel calculations\u00a0as they navigated their 13,000-mile journey from Louisiana to Japan and back again. But this was something different. Up front, the two pilots began working through their checklists. Capt. Jinan Andrews read each step out loud, while Capt. Tramaine \u201cOmaha\u201d Barnett piloted the jet. Sitting on the massive bomber\u2019s sole bunk, the third pilot on the flight crew, Capt. Sabin \u201cJett\u201d Park, backed them up, making sure they didn\u2019t miss any items. With 14 hours of flying and nearly 7,000 miles separating the strategic bomber from its home base, the pilots made the decision to shut the engine down. The B-52 that accompanied us across the Pacific Ocean had landed in Japan. Now our flight, MYLAR11, would be flying back alone and down an engine. Fortunately, the B-52 has multiple engines, but it\u2019s a reminder that the US military is still relying on an aircraft first flown in the 1950s that has outlasted the Cold War by more than 30 years. The Boeing B-52H Stratofortress is America\u2019s primary strategic bomber, taking part in every US war since Vietnam. CNN gained exclusive access to an epic flight on one of the venerable eight-engined jets that serve as\u00a0an instantly recognizable symbol of American air power. This particular jet was manufactured in 1961 and though they are decades older than their crew members, B-52s remain the cornerstone of the US bomber fleet,\u00a0sending\u00a0a high-profile message to\u00a0US\u00a0allies and adversaries. \u201cIf you would go back and look at both the national leadership of Russia and the national leadership of China, what do they react to?\u201d asks Maj. Gen. Jason Armagost, the commander of the Eighth Air Force. \u201cWe see that they publicly comment about our bomber task force missions, particularly when it involves others in very joint and public ways.\u201d Our flight took off in the pre-dawn hours of April 1 for one of the longest missions in the world. The B-52 would fly from the continental US, down Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Islands, off Russia\u2019s east coast and down by China and North Korea to a block of airspace off the Korean Peninsula. Then, without landing, MYLAR 11 would fly in formation with fighters from South Korea and Japan before returning home. The flight would take 33 hours and cover more than 13,000 miles. The jet cruised at about 28,000 feet, mostly over the icy waters of the north Pacific Ocean, where waves were predicted to exceed 20 feet. In total, the B-52 was expected to burn 105,000 gallons of jet fuel during the flight. \u201cNot only are we one of the most visible and flexible legs of the nuclear triad, but it\u2019s just a really easy way for the Air Force and the US to assure our allies,\u201d said Capt. Bo \u201cNATO\u201d Cain, a weapon systems officer on the flight.\u00a0The nuclear triad, which includes strategic bombers, ballistic missile silos, and ballistic missile submarines, comprises America\u2019s nuclear deterrent. The B-52 is the most mobile element of the triad. \u201cWe have a B-52 where you need it, when you need it, within 48 hours.\u201d An epic journey A standard crew for missions of this length is three pilots, three weapon systems officers, and one electronic warfare officer. Most of the crew on MYLAR11 had never been on a mission this long. A few hours into the flight, one thing becomes painfully obvious: the B-52 was never built for comfort. Though the jet has a\u00a0185-foot\u00a0wingspan and a length of nearly 160 feet, the entire crew is crammed into the front portion of the jet, split between the confined upper deck and the windowless lower deck. The pilots rotate spots, with one frequently resting in the only bunk on board. For the rest of the crew, finding a position to rest often requires curling up on the floor or leaning against a panel. Capt. Leo \u201cSwabbie\u201d Weber, a weapon systems officer, described his first 30+ hour flight as a \u201croller coaster ride.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re excited when you take off, you go through your sleepy lulls and then you realize you\u2019re not even a quarter of the way yet,\u201d he said. \u201cTrying to stay focused has been tough but a challenge that I accept and enjoy.\u201d In the long stretches of flight between four aerial refuelings, the crew passes the time with casual conversation, rest and snacks. On MYLAR11, Lt. Rebecca \u201cVulcan\u201d Moore, the electronic warfare officer, brought chicken nuggets for the crew, which she was ready to heat up in the tiny oven perched behind the rows of circuit breakers. Mini-pizza bagels and chocolate chip cookies are also crew favorites. Moore\u2019s official role is to track threats outside the jet, but she takes it upon herself to know how everyone is doing inside it. \u201cI am trying to make sure I\u2019m paying attention to who\u2019s tired? Is somebody hungry? Is there something I can help somebody with?\u201d said Moore. \u201cAs you\u2019ve seen, this is an old jet, and it takes a full crew to work all of the many problems that come with it.\u201d Future of the B-52 The Air Force is planning to upgrade the B-52H to newer B-52J models, giving them more efficient engines, upgraded avionics and new radars. The modernization program will keep the jets flying for nearly a century since they first entered service in the mid-1950s. \u201cFor decades to come, we\u2019re going to be able to see how a jet that\u2019s been around for decades and decades can continue to evolve with the times and be just as capable, if not more capable, than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d said Lt. Col. Jared Patterson, commander of the 20th Bomb Squadron. This year, the Air Force began low-rate production of the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider, the next generation of stealth bomber. China is not far behind, with Beijing promising that its secretive H-20 strategic bomber will soon be unveiled publicly. The B-52s proponents insist it still has a role in the future. \u201cThis has been probably the most adaptable airframe potentially in the history of aerospace,\u201d said Col. Michael Maginness, commander of the 2nd Bomb Wing. \u201cIt started its life out as a high-level nuclear bomber. We turned it into a low-level penetrating bomber. We turned it into a standoff cruise missile platform. And along the way, it picked up just about every other air-to-ground mission set in the US Department of Defense.\u201d The mission area On the western edge of the Pacific Ocean, MYLAR11 reaches the mission area, a rectangle of air space between southern Japan and South Korea. Hours earlier, North Korea test fired a mid-range ballistic missile, a stark reminder of the threats in the area. In October, Chinese fighter jets intercepted a B-52 bomber at night over the South China Sea, south of our position. The Chinese jet flew within 10 feet of the much larger bomber in what the US called an \u201cunsafe intercept.\u201d This time, it\u2019s allied fighters nearby. Between layers of clouds, our B-52 and a second accompanying bomber fly in formation with Japanese and South Korean fighters, who take up positions off our wings. In reduced visibility with multiple aircraft flying close together, the crew remains alert. But the smaller fighters, who don\u2019t have the endurance of the massive bomber, can\u2019t linger long. The mission requires precise timing. \u201cThe more players there are, the more complex and interesting the mission gets,\u201d said Capt. Sabin \u201cJett\u201d Park, one of the B-52 pilots. After snapping a few pictures of the jets in formation, we soon turn back for home when the caution light on engine 5 shines bright orange. Within minutes, the crew shuts down the engine. There is no panic - just a management of risk. Even with one engine out, the B-52 has seven engines to carry it home. It is not a smart airplane like modern 5th generation fighters, but it is redundant, with numerous backup systems to carry it through its missions. \u201cDespite how many years the B-52 has been running, and it being considered a legacy aircraft, it is a very formidable one,\u201d said Capt. Jinan Andrews. \u201cShe is a tough girl.\u201d After skirting the airspace off eastern Russia on the return flight, we settle in for the long journey home. Everyone is tired, especially as we approach the 24-hour mark of the flight, but the mission is not yet complete. Landing any aircraft is a challenge, one made more difficult by the duration of the flight. And the B-52 has one final surprise for the crew. On final approach, with Barksdale Air Force Base looming off our nose, the right main gear does not extend. \u201cGo ahead and emergency extend it,\u201d orders Capt. Tramaine \u201cOmaha\u201d Barnett, the mission commander. Seconds later, we touch down after 33 hours on runway 33, deploying the jet\u2019s drag parachute as we slow down on the runway.

The Atlanta-based airline said its adjusted earnings came in at $380 million, or 45 cents a share, up from $217 million, up 75% from a year earlier. It easily topped Wall Street analysts\u2019 consensus forecast of 36 cents a share. Revenue of $12.6 billion was up 6% and a record for the first three months of the year. It posted the increase despite the average revenue passengers paid to fly every mile slipping 2% in the period. Passenger revenue when adjusted for capacity, another measure of fares, was flat compared to a year ago. The first quarter is typically the least profitable period of the year for US airlines. Delta predicted it would report record revenue in the second quarter, it said it expects thinner profit margins. So it now expects earnings per share of between $2.20 to $2.50, which would be down from the record adjusted earnings per share of $2.64 a year ago. But it said it remains on target to reach full-year of $6 to $7 per share, which could be above the $6.25 a share it reported for 2023. Losses expected at at other US airlines Delta has been less affected that some of its major rivals whose operations were disrupted by problems at Boeing. Delta has no 737 Max jets in its fleet currently, although it has placed orders for some of the jets. Only about half of its mainline jets come from Boeing, compared to about 80% of United Airlines\u2019 fleet, and 100% of the planes flown by Southwest. And this is expected to be a difficult quarter for the US airline industry, with all the other US airlines among America\u2019s nine largest carriers forecast to report losses in the period, whether or not they fly Boeing or Airbus jets. With fares flat to lower and costs including labor and fuel rising, making a profit in the historically slow period is likely to prove difficult. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said there is strong demand going forward though. The airline had its 11 busiest days for booking tickets in its history during the course of the quarter, and he says demand for business travel has been especially strong. But he acknowledged that there are rising concerns about airline safety in the wake of a January 5 Alaska Airlines flight in which the door plug of a 737 Max blew off, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the 737 Max flight. Subsequent incidents reported in the media have only added to passenger worries. \u201cThe headlines, you can\u2019t escape it,\u201d he said, but noted that safety at Delta, as well as at other airlines, is a top priority. \u201cUS aviation travel is the safest form of transportation in the world,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s safer than driving, it\u2019s safer than trains, it\u2019s safer than walking.\u201d Delays in jet deliveries Delta has not taken a delivery of a Boeing jet since 2019. In July 2022 it placed an order for 100 of the Boeing 737 Max 10 jets, the largest version of the Max. It was originally due to start taking deliveries of those jets next year. The Federal Aviation Administration has yet to certify that plane to carry passengers, but criticism of Boeing\u2019s safety and the quality controls in the wake of the Alaska Air incident prompted Boeing to withdraw its request for a waiver necessary to get certification this year. That incident prompted United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby to announce it was no longer counting on the 737 Max 10 planes it had already ordered from Boeing, saying the problem was the \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d for the airline\u2019s expectations for the plane. Bastian didn\u2019t sound much more hopeful for when Delta might get the Max 10 jets it ordered. \u201cI\u2019m confident it will deliver at some point,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s two years, three years, four years from now, I don\u2019t think anyone knows.\u201d Shares of Delta gained 4% in premarket trading on the report.

Adding to an already miserable start to 2024, Boeing stood accused Tuesday of routinely ignoring a whistleblower\u2019s complaints about the allegedly critically flawed manufacturing process for its 787 Dreamliner planes. The whistleblower claimed Boeing retaliated against him and put him on the 777 unit as punishment. That\u2019s when, he says, he found even more production problems. Boeing strongly denies the claims and says it is confident in the safety of its aircraft. Still, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would investigate \u2014\u00a0adding to a growing list of federal probes into the beleaguered company, including a criminal investigation. And next week, a Senate subcommittee will hear testimony about the whistleblower\u2019s case and will presumably air more of Boeing\u2019s dirty laundry in public. More allegations of lax safety standards are the last thing the company \u2014 and the flying public \u2014\u00a0need right now. The whistleblower complaint is doing further damage to Boeing\u2019s already battered public image: a company with a broken safety record, led by highly paid executives who are careless about quality standards. Yet the bad news for Boeing apparently knows no end. The whistleblower\u2019s accusations The whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, a Boeing engineer, alleged that Boeing took shortcuts when manufacturing its 777 and 787 Dreamliner jets \u2014\u00a0skipping crucial safety steps, which could lead to catastrophic failure of the airplanes as they age. The shortcuts could dramatically reduce the airplanes\u2019 expected lifespan of up to 50 years in service.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0was first to report the whistleblower\u2019s claims. His formal complaint to the FAA, filed in January and made public Tuesday, was not entirely new \u2014\u00a0the FAA had already investigated Boeing over 787 production concerns and halted 787 deliveries. But Salehpour\u2019s complaint shed new light on how crews assembling the 787 Dreamliner apparently failed to properly fill tiny gaps when joining separately manufactured parts of the fuselage for 1,000 planes. That could add stress on the planes\u2019 joints, something that can be hard to identify in inspections, Salehpour said. He alleged Boeing knew about the process errors and, what\u2019s more, encouraged them in order to reduce 787 assembly bottlenecks. Boeing has said the 787 is safe to fly and, before halting deliveries of the model, the FAA rigorously scrutinized Boeing\u2019s manufacturing processes that Salehpour questioned. It ultimately approved the planes for shipments to airlines in March 2023 after becoming satisfied that Boeing had fixed the problem. \u201cThese claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate and do not represent the comprehensive work Boeing has done to ensure the quality and long-term safety of the aircraft,\u201d the company said in a statement Tuesday. Salehpour said that in his new role at the 777 unit he discovered subpar work, with crews misaligning body pieces while Boeing pressured engineers to approve work they had not yet inspected. \u201cWe are fully confident in the safety and durability of the 777 family,\u201d Boeing said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThese claims are inaccurate.\u201d How Boeing got here The latest accusations are pouring gasoline on a dumpster fire. Critics argue the company\u2019s once sterling safety reputation was tarnished in its ill-advised 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas, and it has been all downhill from there, culminating in two fatal crashes of the 737 Max in 2018 and 2019. Boeing acknowledged it was liable for those crashes \u2014\u00a0and that they were caused by a design flaw it has since fixed after a nearly two-year grounding. The recent nonstop streak of bad news began during the last week of 2023, when an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two 737 Max aircraft. Then, during the first weekend of 2024, part of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max\u00a0blew off the side of the plane\u00a0just after take-off, and Boeing has been in crisis mode ever since. A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board revealed that Boeing\u00a0probably did not put the bolts\u00a0in the so-called door plug that are designed to prevent the part from blowing off the plane. Boeing hasn\u2019t acknowledged the specific accusations in the federal report, although CEO Dave Calhoun admitted the company made a mistake and said in response to the probe that Boeing is ultimately responsible. That incident resulted in a temporary nationwide grounding of certain 737 Max jets, followed by congressional hearings, production and delivery delays, multiple federal investigations \u2014 including the criminal probe \u2014 and a fall of about 30% in Boeing\u2019s stock this year, which shaved nearly $50 billion off the company\u2019s market valuation. The bad news didn\u2019t stop there. In February, pilots on a United Airlines 737 Max reported that the flight controls\u00a0jammed as the plane landed\u00a0in Newark, New Jersey. A month ago, the FAA flagged safety issues\u00a0with the de-icing equipment on 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner models that could cause engines to lose thrust. The FAA is allowing the planes to continue flying and Boeing said the problem does not pose an immediate safety risk. But, after reviewing Boeing\u2019s production workflow and standards, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said last month that the regulator found issues with \u201creally important\u201d aspects of Boeing\u2019s manufacturing and assembly line and gave the company until late May to produce a plan to fix is production problems. Boeing said it is working on several of the issues Whitaker identified. What\u2019s next for Boeing The fallout for Boeing has reached the top ranks of its leadership. The company has let several executives go, including the overseer of its commercial jets and a longtime executive in charge of the 737 Max unit. CEO Dave Calhoun also said he would step down before the end of the year \u2014\u00a0after he was paid $32.8 million last year and as he is set to take home $45 million for his retirement. Boeing\u2019s latest problems will cost it dearly: Airl\ufeffines effectively stopped ordering planes from Boeing in January, and the only 737 Max planes they ordered last month were for the version that isn\u2019t allowed to fly yet \u2014\u00a0specifically, the larger Max 10 \u2014\u00a0because of the de-icing issue. The company could also be subject to hefty fines and onerous lawsuits. Boeing has already paid Alaska Airlines more than $150 million in compensation for the temporary grounding of its planes following the door plug blowout. The company hasn\u2019t turned a profit in years, and the Alaska Airlines incident won\u2019t help Boeing make money this year either. Boeing faces no existential threat, though. The company has just one major competitor in the production of commercial aircraft globally \u2014\u00a0Airbus. Airlines can\u2019t easily switch between airplane manufacturers, making the company immune to typical market forces like passengers choosing a different manufacturer. Although there\u2019s some evidence that angry or nervous flyers prefer Airbus flights, opting for that can be impractical or impossible depending on where they want to travel. Still, Boeing\u2019s shareholders, regulators and customers are growing more irate by the day, and the company is ultimately beholden to them. Boeing\u2019s already bruised reputation means regaining airlines\u2019 trust could prove difficult \u2014\u00a0let alone the confidence of flabbergasted regulators. The drip, drip, drip of bad news makes a turnaround even harder. With new leadership on its way, Boeing\u2019s future top brass have their work cut out for them. And the world\u2019s eyes will be on them.", "articleSection": ["business", "investing"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "David Goldman", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/david-goldman"}], "dateModified": "2024-04-10T10:44:15.858Z", "description": "Adding to an already miserable start to 2024, Boeing has now been accused of routinely ignoring a whistleblower\u2019s complaints about the allegedly critically flawed manufacturing process for its 787 Dreamliner planes.", "headline": "Boeing somehow managed to get itself into even bigger trouble", "image": [{"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1981167135.jpg?c=original", "caption": "Signage outside the Boeing Co. manufacturing facility in Renton, Washington, US, on Monday, Feb. 5, 2024.

Salehpour on Tuesday said his complaint raises \u201ctwo quality issues that may dramatically reduce the life of the planes.\u201d \u201cI am doing this not because I want Boeing to fail, but because I want it to succeed and prevent crashes from happening,\u201d Salehpour told reporters on a conference call Tuesday.\u00a0\u201cThe truth is Boeing can\u2019t keep going the way it is.\u00a0It needs to do a little bit better, I think.\u201d The FAA has interviewed Salehpour as part of its investigation, his attorney Lisa Banks said.\u00a0The FAA said it investigates all whistleblower complaints. \u201cVoluntary reporting without fear of reprisal is a critical component in aviation safety,\u201d the FAA said.\u00a0 \u201cWe strongly encourage everyone in the aviation industry to share information.\u201d A Senate subcommittee will also take up the concerns at a hearing next week. \u201cWe are fully confident in the safety and durability of the 777 family,\u201d Boeing said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThese claims are inaccurate.\u201d  It also disputed Salehpour\u2019s concerns about the 787. \u201cThese claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate and do not represent the comprehensive work Boeing has done to ensure the quality and long-term safety of the aircraft,\u201d the company said in a statement. Gaps in the Dreamliner Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner planes, which entered service in 2011, could have 50-year lifespans \u2013 around 44,000 flights each, the company says. But Salehpour\u2019s complaint alleges crews assembling the plane failed to properly fill tiny gaps when joining separately manufactured parts of the fuselage.\u00a0That puts more wear on the plane, shortening its lifespan and risking \u201ccatastrophic\u201d failure, Salehpour\u2019s attorneys alleged. The allegations aren\u2019t entirely new: For nearly two years starting in 2021, the FAA and Boeing halted deliveries of the new Dreamliners while it looked into the gaps.\u00a0Boeing said it made changes in its manufacturing process, and deliveries ultimately resumed. \u201cWe incorporated the join inspection and verification activity into our production system so that airplanes coming off of the production line meet these specifications,\u201d Boeing said. The 787 Dreamliners were not grounded, but the FAA twice investigated questions about quality control during the jet\u2019s assembly process. The company maintained that the planes were and are safe to fly. Salehpour\u2019s attorneys said the FAA was surprised to discover through his complaint that the gaps were still an issue. \u201cI literally saw people jumping on the pieces of the airplane to get them to align,\u201d Salehpour said.\u00a0\u201cBy jumping up and down, you\u2019re deforming parts so that the holes align temporarily \u2026\u00a0and that\u2019s not how you build an airplane.\u201d Alleged retaliation led to another discovery Salehpour said Boeing retaliated against him after he raised another concern about the 787 and a different plane model. The whistleblower complaint said he pointed out to management the existence of drilling issues with the 787, and was then \u201cignored and ultimately transferred out of the 787 program to the 777 program.\u201d In his new role, Salehpour said he discovered subpar work with aligning body pieces, and pressure on engineers to green-light work they have not yet inspected. In all, Salehpour said the issues involve more than 400 777s and 1,000 787s. Boeing (BA) shares fell 2% Tuesday. This is a developing story.

Beginning May 1, the airline will board customers by numbered zones, a change that largely reverts back to process it used until early 2019, before changing to its current process of boarding by named categories (i.e. cabins, status and ticket types). Delta will maintain the same boarding order, but the categories will be called \u201czones,\u201d beginning with zone 1 and ending with zone 8. For example, \u201cPre-Boarding\u201d and \u201cFirst Class\u201d categories will be called zone 1, the \u201cComfort+\u201d category is being changed to zone 3 and the \u201cMain Cabin\u201d groups will now be grouped in zones 5 through 7, before ending with \u201cBasic Economy\u201d now in zone 8. The airline said in a statement that the new numbered boarding zones \u201cprovide customers with more clarity\u201d about the boarding process and will be used on all Delta flights. The new numbered zones will be printed on customers\u2019 boarding passes. End of a five-year system Next month\u2019s changes means the end of a five-year boarding process that Delta changed to board its plane on the branded fares that customers\u2019 purchased as part of an effort to bring \u201cconsistency, simplicity and clarity to the gate and boarding experience.\u201d It also introduced colors on gate screens and electronic boarding passes to the boarding process to help flyers identify their zone, which the airline will keep using. \u201cZone boarding, an aviation standard for decades, will soon be a thing of the past for Delta customers,\u201d the airline said in a 2018 release. It also expanded the number of boarding groups to \u201cencourage fewer customers to line up in the gate area at any one time.\u201d Delta will be keeping the same number of zones, too. Every minute counts when boarding Of course, any flyer knows that boarding is usually a chaotic process that no US carrier has exactly nailed down. United Airlines recently changed its boarding procedure for economy class passengers, with window seat passengers boarding first, followed by middle seat and then aisle seats. The airline said the process saves \u201cup to two minutes of boarding time.\u201d \u201cSaving even one minute in airplane turn time can sum up to several hundred million dollars per year for a large airline,\u201d John Milne of Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York, previously told CNN.

Milne says the time savings come down to better utilizing a key airline resource \u2013airplanes \u2013 adding \u201cparticularly large savings for an airline result when the boarding time reduction leads to offering an additional flight during the day.\u201d American Airlines switched to a nine-group boarding system in 2017 and made some tweaks to that system in 2023.

American placed orders for 85 of the Boeing 737 Max 10, the largest version of that troubled aircraft. It also converted previous orders for 30 of the shorter Max 8 version of the plane, which is currently flying, into additional Max 10 orders. American also has options to buy another 75 Max 10s in the future. The order had been announced a month ago, and it was included in the March and first quarter sales and delivery report by Boeing on Tuesday. That report showed no other orders for any version of the 737 Max. Besides American\u2019s large Max order, Boeing also received orders for 28 of its widebody 777 jets during the month. But certification of the Max 10, which had been due to start flying passengers by this year, has been pushed back in the wake of the January 5 Alaska Airlines flight of a 737 Max 9, which had a door plug blow out, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Questions about anti-icing equipment on the Max engines would have required Boeing to get a waiver from the FAA to get the Max 10 and a smaller Max 7 model certified. But criticism of Boeing\u2019s safety and the quality controls in the wake of the Alaska Air incident prompted Boeing to withdrawal its request for a waiver, thus bringing the certification process to a temporary halt. The door plug incident prompted United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby to announce it was no longer counting on the 737 Max 10 planes it had already ordered from Boeing, saying the problem was the \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d for the airline\u2019s expectations for the plane. While it has yet to drop its orders for the Max 10, Kirby has said the airline is interested in possibly buying competing planes from Boeing rival Airbus. But it would likely be a much longer wait for United to get planes from Airbus due the backlog of orders the European aircraft maker has. Boeing had had a record month for commercial jet orders in December ahead of the Alaska Air incident, capping a strong year for sales overall. But its orders ground to a near halt in January after the January 5 flight, causing it to suffer its worst month for orders since the pandemic. While it bounced back to report 15 orders in February, that was far below Boeing\u2019s normal monthly volume. Thus, the order from American, which has its mainline fleet roughly split between Airbus and Boeing, was an important vote of confidence for the trouble aircraft maker. Orders for planes before certification are not unusual in the aerospace industry but not typically when there are questions about when the plane might be cleared to carry passengers. Boeing also reported it delivered only 24 of the 737 Max jets in the month, and five 787 Dreamliners.

of deja vu flooded over Barb Handley and her siblings as news of the midflight blowout of an Alaska Airlines plug door \u2013 and the gaping hole it left behind \u2013 emerged in January. Images of the refrigerator-sized void conjured up heart-wrenching memories of the death of their mother, who in 1989 was among nine passengers blown out of a United Airlines Boeing 747 when its cargo door blew open over the Pacific Ocean, taking with it a large chunk of the cabin wall. \u201cIt felt like seeing the hole through which I was visualizing my mother being thrown out a plane,\u201d Handley said of the Alaska Airlines blowout in January, which happened on a Boeing 737 Max 9. Handley has flown countless times since her mother\u2019s death and has never been able to shake her nervousness. But the January blowout \u2013 and a string of recent mishaps involving Boeing jets \u2013 has ratcheted her anxieties to new levels. \u201cI know my brother and my sisters feel the same way,\u201d she said. \u201cYou wonder, \u2018Has there been enough due diligence with this individual plane, with this airline, with this manufacturer?\u2019 And those feelings are definitely heightened with the Boeing incidents.\u201d Though no passengers were killed during the Alaska Airlines incident, experts have said it could have been far more catastrophic. The chair of the National Transportation Safety Board has warned that \u201csomething like this can happen again.\u201d The two seats closest to the door plug were thankfully unoccupied, yet the blowout caused an air pressure loss severe enough to rip a boy\u2019s shirt off and twist the seats\u2019 metal frames toward the opening. An early assessment from the NTSB found that Boeing may have left critical bolts off the jet. The blowout is among a handful of harrowing air travel incidents that have contributed to a growing sense of unease among some travelers, including a violent plunge that sent passengers slamming into the ceiling of a Boeing Dreamliner jet last month and a case of severe turbulence that required several people to be taken to the hospital. A parade of less severe mishaps has also captured attention. The Federal Aviation Administration is taking a close look at United Airlines after nearly a dozen incidents so far this year \u2013 all on Boeing jets \u2013 including a missing external panel, flames shooting from an engine after takeoff and a wheel popping off. The string of incidents has led sisters Cara and Erin Ashcraft, who survived a fatal 1999 plane crash, to seriously second-guess air travel for the first time in years. \u201cWe have both flown many times since the crash, but for the first time in my life, I\u2019m actually afraid I could be in another crash again,\u201d Cara said in response to CNN\u2019s call for readers\u2019 input on air travel. The sisters were 10 and 13 years old when their plane overran a runway and crashed in Little Rock, Arkansas, killing 11 people and seriously injuring most other passengers. Both sisters recovered from serious burns from a fire that erupted during the crash and vowed not to let the terrifying incident prevent them from traveling. \u201cReally, the only reason we\u2019re able to get on the flight is because we trust the thousands of people involved from the beginning \u2013 from funding and designing the plane to building it and operating it. We expect that they\u2019ve done their jobs and that they\u2019re putting safety first,\u201d Cara Ashcraft told CNN. After seeing the slew of aircraft issues and increased federal oversight, she said, \u201cThat trust gets damaged.\u201d \u2018Erosion of public trust\u2019 More than 100 people responded to CNN\u2019s call for reader input, and many of them detailed their burgeoning unease with air travel during the recent spate of incidents. Many said they have begun to avoid flying Boeing aircraft, in some cases rethinking their long-held loyalties to airlines with Boeing-heavy fleets. Several said they now avoid sitting in coveted window and exit row seats out of concern for another incident like the Alaska Airlines blowout. And some expressed frustration that easing their concerns sometimes requires purchasing more costly tickets or avoiding travel altogether.  Others, however, said they are still confident in flight safety, pointing out that commercial air travel remains one of the safest modes of transportation. The last major fatal commercial plane accident in the United States was in 2009, and between 2010 and 2022, there have been only five commercial flight accident deaths. Last year, international commercial aviation boasted a record low fatality risk, with a person needing to travel by air every day for 103,239 years on average to experience a fatal accident, according to the International Air Transport Association\u2019s annual safety report. But even as the risk of a commercial plane crash is low, the Ashcraft sisters and other readers expressed concern that other in-air events such as severe turbulence could be traumatizing and have already begun to chip away at their trust in air travel safety. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that people should never fly again or I won\u2019t ever fly again,\u201d Erin Ashcraft said. \u201cBut I think that the erosion of public trust is a huge issue.\u201d \u2018I\u2019ve never had concerns before. This is new\u2019 Trey Smith has long relied on United Airlines for his monthly work trips out of Virginia, often catching up on sleep while in the air. But the series of incidents on United aircraft in recent months has made him increasingly restless on flights and led him to reconsider his preferred airline. \u201cI\u2019ve never had concerns (about air travel safety) before. This is new,\u201d Smith told CNN. During recent flights, Smith said he has begun to use United\u2019s flight-tracking app to monitor the aircraft\u2019s path and altitude for any sign of a disturbance. He has also been delaying planning a trip with his wife and four daughters because he\u2019s nervous about bringing his children on a plane. \u201cTraveling was fun once upon a time, but now it\u2019s more it\u2019s more scary and worrisome,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie, I pray more now before we take off and before we land.\u201d Smith believes airlines should disclose an aircraft\u2019s maintenance and inspection records to travelers so they can make \u201can educated decision\u201d about their flight and the aircraft. United has made efforts to reassure passengers such as Smith after the incidents on its Boeing jets, which made up about 80% of the airline\u2019s mainline operation fleet as of the end of last year. United CEO Scott Kirby said in a message to customers last month that the incidents \u201chave our attention and have sharpened our focus\u201d and that safety is \u201cat the center of everything that we do.\u201d Soon after, in a memo announcing the FAA\u2019s increased attention on the airline\u2019s safety procedures, United told its employees, \u201cThe number of safety-related events in recent weeks have rightfully caused us to pause and evaluate whether there is anything we can and should do differently.\u201d A mother who feels \u2018powerless\u2019 trying to avoid Boeing Aubrey, a mother who lives in Los Angeles with her husband and 5-year-old daughter, recognizes that air travel is still generally safe but doesn\u2019t feel confident bringing her daughter on Boeing aircraft given years of troubling incidents, particularly on the 737 Max, which has seen two fatal crashes outside the United States since 2018. But she said she has begun to feel \u201cpowerless\u201d as she plans a family trip to see loved ones on the East Coast and has struggled to find a flight on non-Boeing aircraft that fits her family\u2019s schedule and isn\u2019t \u201cexorbitantly expensive.\u201d Even if she does find a flight on an Airbus, the airline could change the aircraft model before the flight. In that case, she said, \u201cAirlines make it so difficult and costly to change a flight that I feel we\u2019d have no choice but to go ahead with the trip if our plane got changed to a Max at the last minute.\u201d \u201cYou want to be able to make a statement as a consumer that you don\u2019t want to use a certain product, and it\u2019s frustrating when you feel like you can\u2019t avoid it,\u201d said Aubrey, who asked that her last name be omitted because of privacy concerns. Though a crash is unlikely, she is concerned for her daughter\u2019s safety if there is a severe turbulence event such as those that have left passengers injured on flights operated by Southwest, Delta Air Lines and Hawaiian Airlines, among others. \u201cI hate that I\u2019m now having to consider what type of plane it is. And I\u2019m very resentful that I don\u2019t feel that Boeing has shown proper remorse for the accidents. I don\u2019t trust that they\u2019re actually taking the steps necessary to make this safer.\u201d So really, how safe is it to fly? Though flying is far safer than other modes of travel, aviation experts have mixed opinions on whether consumers have reason to be concerned. \u201cIf you look at the numbers, you\u2019re more at risk to have an accident driving to the airport than you are flying at 38,000 feet. I tell people, if you make it to your flight, the most hazardous part of your day is actually behind you,\u201d Anthony Brickhouse, a professor of aviation safety at Florida\u2019s Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, told CNN last month. Passengers, he added, should focus less on the aircraft they\u2019re boarding and more on making sure they comply with safety procedures on board. The Alaska Airlines Max 9 blowout is being investigated by the US Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, Brickhouse noted. The fact that the aircraft is\u00a0back in the air\u00a0means they have completed whatever inspections were necessary to ensure it is as safe as possible, he said. Despite the statistics, Ed Pierson, the director of the Foundation for Aviation Safety and a harsh critic of Boeing, told CNN previously that he won\u2019t fly on the Boeing 737 Max out of concern over the aircraft manufacturer\u2019s quality control standards. However, other aircraft \u2013 even older Boeing models \u2013 aren\u2019t off limits. \u201cTaking the Max out of the equation, (flying has) been proven to be pretty darn safe,\u201d he said last month. Pierson is wary of attitudes around the apparent safety of American air travel, he said. Such thinking may prevent necessary improvements from being made. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of overconfidence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gold standard is melting down, because we continue to try to downplay everything and talk about how safe the system is. That\u2019s not the right mindset. That\u2019s the mindset that gets people killed.\u201d Even as the US commercial aviation industry has gone more than a decade without a major fatal crash, there have been narrowly averted disasters on the ground. In July 2017, an Air Canada jet piloted by a captain who had been awake for more than 19 hours\u00a0nearly landed on a taxiway\u00a0at San Francisco International Airport where three wide-body jets filled with passengers were waiting to take off. The NTSB later said more than 1,000 people on the four planes might have died had the plane not diverted at the last moment. Though Brickhouse is fairly confident in the aviation system\u2019s safety, he didn\u2019t dismiss those who are fearful or who might want to avoid aircraft such as the 737 Max, noting he has his own concerns about things such as the number of narrowly avoided accidents at the nation\u2019s airports. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in luck, but we are fortunate that these incidents did not turn into disasters,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have a trend that keeps occurring, you need to focus on fixing it.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore and Jacopo Prisco contributed to this report.", "articleSection": ["travel", "aviation"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Elizabeth Wolfe", "url": ""}], "dateModified": "2024-04-06T07:00:26.217Z", "description": "A recent string of aviation incidents has stirred up fear once again among plane crash survivors and victims\u2019 loved ones.

Calhoun\u2019s total compensation in 2023 was $32.8 million, a 45% increase from the $22.6 million he received for 2022. And it could have been a lot more: He declined to accept his annual incentive bonus of $2,800,000 \u2013 a request the board said he made after part of a Boeing 737 Max plane blew off the side of an Alaska Airlines flight in January, kicking off a series of federal investigations, a temporary grounding, executive ousters and another embarrassing public relations blunder for the company. Boeing enjoyed improved financial results in 2023 from Calhoun\u2019s first two years running the troubled aircraft manufacturer. It continued to lose money as it has every year since 2019, but it trimmed those losses by 60%, reporting a core operating loss of $1.8 billion. Its stock gained 37% during the year, and it had a record month for new commercial jet orders in December, giving it one of its best sales years ever, as airlines were eager for new jets to meet strong demand for travel. But after the January 5 door plug blowout, causing a gaping hole in the side of the jet, Boeing\u2019s reputation for safety and quality may have reached an all-time low. A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the plane had left a Boeing factory two months before the incident missing the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place. Calhoun told investors in January that \u201cwe caused the problem, and we understand that. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.\u201d Last month, Calhoun announced he would be retiring later this year and that the company had launched a search for a new CEO. Calhoun turns 67 later this month, and Boeing\u2019s board had actually moved back the retirement age for CEOs by five years to keep him in place. Upon his retirement, Calhoun is set to take home a giant going-away present: a $45 million mix of stock awards and options that vest over time. That\u2019s on top of whatever salary and bonus he may earn this year \u2013 although it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Boeing\u2019s board vastly reduces his 2024 pay, and perhaps his retirement awards, because of the state he has left the company in as CEO. Boeing did not respond to a request for comment. Calhoun became CEO in January of 2020, in the midst of a 20-month grounding of the 737 Max that followed two fatal crashes that killed 346 people in late 2018 and early 2019. Almost immediately Boeing and the aviation industry was hit by a near halt in air travel caused by the pandemic, which caused demand for planes to come to a near halt. In April of that year Calhoun suspended his base pay. But stock and other compensation he had already received when taking the job brought his 2020 total compensation to $21.7 million. It climbed slowly steadily in the two subsequent years, bringing his total compensation to $64.6 million heading into 2023.", "articleSection": ["business"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Chris Isidore", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/chris-isidore"}], "correction": "A previous version of this story misstated Calhoun's 2022 compensation.

In 2017, Qatar Airways introduced its game-changing business class cabin, officially known as Qsuites. The suite-style business class is arranged favorably no matter if you\u2019re traveling solo, with a partner or with your family. On one hand, you can experience total privacy in the air thanks to the fully enclosed suite doors, while you can also lower these partitions to create a shared space. In short, flying in Qatar Airways Qsuites is arguably one of the best ways to enjoy world-class dining and unrivaled personal space at 30,000 feet above the earth. In this guide, we\u2019ll take a closer look at the amenities \u2014 both on the ground and in the air \u2014 as well as the ways you can book these coveted seats for a fraction of the $5,000+ sticker price with travel rewards. What are Qatar Airways Qsuites? What makes Qatar Airways Qsuites so special is the experience from beginning to end. At your departure airport, your business class ticket will allow for two checked bags and a dedicated check-in counter. Then, you\u2019ll have access to a dedicated airport lounge to enjoy the first (of many) meals. You\u2019ll get access to a partner lounge if there\u2019s no Qatar-branded lounge in your particular airport. Qatar Airways is part of the Oneworld alliance, so that could mean a British Airways or an American Airlines lounge. At Qatar Airways\u2019 Doha (DOH) hub, you\u2019ll have access to the Al Mourjan Business Lounge. This lounge has plenty of international food options, a business center and plenty of seating. There are a few noteworthy features of the Qsuites. With a 1-2-1 configuration, every row alternates facing forward or backward, which results in a supreme amount of space afforded to each passenger compared to traditional business-class cabins. The center rows are special as the partition doors can be lowered to conjoin the beds in a customizable fashion. If you\u2019re traveling with another person, the center wall can be lowered to create a double bed like you may have seen in Singapore Airlines\u2019 world-renowned first-class cabin. To make Qsuites even more impressive, families or groups of friends flying together can book a quad suite, which has a private communal space in the middle of the cabin where the partition doors can be lowered for four seats to make a private space to dine together, along with two double beds. Even in the solo window seats, you\u2019ll get to enjoy the utmost privacy in a fully enclosed suite. No matter where you\u2019re sitting, each bed measures around 80 inches in fully lie-flat mode, as well as roughly 21 inches of seat width. Between the fluffy duvet, high-quality skin care products and even a set of pajamas, you\u2019re almost certain to kickstart your journey feeling refreshed. Qatar is also touted for its world-class inflight service, including made-to-order meals, and a stacked menu of alcoholic (and non-alcoholic) libations. What Qatar Airways planes and routes have Qsuites? The Doha-based carrier has a variety of long-haul aircraft, from Airbus A380s to Boeing 777s. Despite its popularity, the Qsuites aren\u2019t available on all of its aircraft, so you\u2019ll have to do a bit of digging to book a seat in the newer business-class cabin. You can check the aircraft type for your route when booking, though aircraft swaps can happen, so you\u2019ll want to keep tabs on your flight up until departure. During the booking process, you can generally find out which aircraft Qatar is flying. Unfortunately, Qatar\u2019s Airbus A380s, Boeing 787-8s and older Airbus A330s are not equipped with Qsuites, boasting the older business class cabin instead. Here\u2019s a quick glimpse of where you can find Qsuites across Qatar\u2019s fleet: Once you find your aircraft type, you can also confirm whether the aircraft carries Qsuites by looking at the seat map on the airline\u2019s website or via tools like SeatGuru. As a general rule, Qatar Airways\u2019 aircraft with a 1-2-1 seat configuration in business class have Qsuites (though not all), while a 2-2-2 layout means that the cabin does not have Qsuites and features older business class seats. As of this writing, the following US cities have Qsuites on flights to Doha. Note that not all flights will have Qsuites if there is more than one flight per day, so check the seat map before you book. How to book Qatar Airways Qsuites with points and miles Finally, you may be wondering how much Qatar Airways Qsuites cost. While it may vary depending on the route, a one-way ticket in Qsuites will set you back at least $5,000 on routes from the US to the Middle East. Fortunately, you can save a ton of money by booking Qsuites using the points and miles earned through popular travel rewards credit cards, and there are lots to pick from. There are various ways to book Qsuites with travel rewards, but some offer a better deal than others. Here\u2019s a look at two of the best deals. Avios Qatar Airways is part of the greater Avios loyalty program, which also includes Aer Lingus, British Airways, Finnair and Iberia. Each of these airlines has its own loyalty programs, but all employ Avios as their currency and you can transfer Avios between accounts. It\u2019s easy to earn and combine your Avios, the streamlined currency of these four airlines, through a multitude of major transferable point programs, including: You can book Qsuites from the US to/from Doha (DOH) for 70,000 Avios plus taxes and fees under $200. Depending on how you book, you could connect onward to another destination in the Middle East for the same price. We recommend booking with Qatar Airways Avios if possible since the pricing is the same as British Airways. However, British Airways charges more for connecting flights, while Qatar Airways\u2019 own loyalty program does not. Thankfully, you can transfer your Avios from British Airways to Qatar Airways on this website. Further, you can transfer other types of Avios to British Airways on Avios.com, and then transfer them on to Qatar Airways. These are some of our favorite travel credit cards for earning points that transfer to Avios: You can also open the British Airways Visa Signature\u00ae Card and earn Avios directly. The card currently offers new card members 75,000 Avios after spending $5,000 on purchases within the first three months of account opening. Plus, you can earn 5 Avios per dollar on up to $10,000 in gas, grocery stores and dining purchases in the first 12 months. American Airlines AAdvantage For an even better deal, consider booking with American Airlines AAdvantage miles. For the same amount, you can add another stop further afield in Qatar\u2019s route network for an additional 5,000 miles. Want to continue on to Johannesburg? How about the Maldives? You can book this Qsuite ticket for just 75,000 miles. Besides flying with American and its Oneworld partners, you can also transfer your Bilt Rewards points from the Bilt Mastercard\u00ae to the frequent flyer program at a 1:1 ratio. However, transfers to AAdvantage are set to end this June. You can also earn AAdvantage miles with American\u2019s suite of credit cards, including the American Airlines AAdvantage\u00ae MileUp\u00ae credit card which has no annual fee or the Citi\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Executive World Elite Mastercard\u00ae which currently offers 70,000 bonus miles after spending $7,000 within the first three months of account opening. Bottom line Qatar Airways\u2019 Qsuite business class product is one of the best in the skies with to its excellent seat design, onboard service and airport lounges. And while it might cost a pretty penny to book it outright, leveraging travel rewards points can make it much more attainable. Looking for a travel credit card?

Modern airliners like the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350 have the same general shape as the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8, which were built in the late 1950s and solidified the \u201ctube and wing\u201d form factor that is still in use today. This is because commercial aviation prioritizes safety, favoring tried-and-tested solutions, and because other developments \u2014 in materials and engines, for example \u2014 mean the traditional design is still relevant. However, a seismic shake-up is about to take place. An entirely new aircraft shape has been cleared to take off into California skies. At the end of last month, Long Beach-based JetZero announced that Pathfinder, its 1:8 scale \u201cblended wing body\u201d demonstrator plane, has been granted an FAA Airworthiness certificate and test flights are imminent. As the industry desperately looks for ways to reduce carbon emissions, it faces a somewhat tougher challenge than other sectors precisely because its core technologies have proven so hard to move away from. It\u2019s a ripe time to innovate. The \u201cblended wing body\u201d looks similar to the \u201cflying wing\u201d design used by military aircraft such as the iconic B-2 bomber, but the blended wing has more volume in the middle section. Both Boeing and Airbus are tinkering with the idea, and JetZero\u2019s new milestone brings it a little closer to its ambitious goal of putting into service a blended wing aircraft as soon as 2030. \u201cWe feel very strongly about a path to zero emissions in big jets, and the blended wing airframe can deliver 50% lower fuel burn and emissions,\u201d Tom O\u2019Leary, co-founder and CEO of JetZero, told CNN in August 2023. \u201cThat is a staggering leap forward in comparison to what the industry is used to.\u201d Under pressure The blended wing concept is far from new, and the earliest attempts at building airplanes with this design date back to the late 1920s in Germany. American aircraft designer and industrialist Jack Northrop created a jet-powered flying wing design in 1947, which inspired the B-2 in the 1990s. As a sort of hybrid between a flying wing and a traditional \u201ctube and wing,\u201d the blended wing allows the entire aircraft to generate lift, minimizing drag. NASA says that this shape \u201chelps to increase fuel economy and creates larger payload (cargo or passenger) areas in the center body portion of the aircraft.\u201d The agency has tested it through one of its experimental planes, the X-48. Over about 120 test flights between 2007 and 2012, two unmanned, remote-controlled X-48s demonstrated the viability of the concept. \u201cAn aircraft of this type would have a wingspan slightly greater than a Boeing 747 and could operate from existing airport terminals,\u201d the agency says, adding that the plane would also \u201cweigh less, generate less noise and emissions, and cost less to operate than an equally advanced conventional transport aircraft.\u201d In 2020, Airbus built a small-blended wing demonstrator, about six feet in length, signaling interest in pursuing a full-size aircraft in the future. But if the shape is so effective, why haven\u2019t we yet moved to building planes based on it? According to O\u2019Leary, there is one main technical challenge holding manufacturers back. \u201cIt\u2019s the pressurization of a non-cylindrical fuselage,\u201d he says, pointing to the fact that a tube-shaped plane is better able to handle the constant expansion and contraction cycles that come with each flight. \u201cIf you think about a \u2018tube and wing,\u2019 it separates the loads \u2014 you have the pressurization load on the tube, and the bending loads on the wings. But a blended wing essentially blends those together. Only now can we do that with composite materials that are both light and strong.\u201d Such a radically new shape would make the interior of the plane look and feel wildly different to today\u2019s widebody aircraft. \u201cIt\u2019s just a much, much wider fuselage,\u201d O\u2019Leary says. \u201cYour typical single-aisle plane has three by three seats, but this is a sort of a shorter, wider tube. You get the same amount of people, but you might have 15 or 20 rows across the cabin, depending upon how each particular airline will configure it. \u201cThis just gives them a whole new palette with which to lay it out. I think it\u2019s going to be amazing to see what their interpretation of this much broader space will be.\u201d Revolutionary potential O\u2019Leary says that the nearest equivalent in terms of size would be the Boeing 767 \u2013 a widebody, twin-engine plane introduced in the 1980s that typically carried around 210 passengers. It\u2019s still produced as a cargo plane but was replaced by the Boeing 787 as a passenger aircraft. It also has a modern military variant, the KC-46, which the US Air Force uses for aerial refueling. Similarly, JetZero wants to simultaneously develop three variants: a passenger plane with seating for 200-plus passengers, a cargo plane and a fuel tanker. The blended wing shape lends itself so well to the latter that last year the US Air Force awarded JetZero $235 million to develop a full-scale demonstrator and validate the performance of the blended wing concept.\u00a0 The military version of the plane is scheduled to lead the way and perhaps support the development of the commercial models. The newly FAA-approved Pathfinder, with its 23-foot wingspan, is a 12.5%-scale version of the full-scale demonstrator, which is expected to take flight by 2027. The plane is designed for 100% compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and to have the internal volume to accommodate zero-carbon emissions hydrogen. However, building an entirely new airplane from scratch is an enormous task, and JetZero\u2019s targets sound ambitious, given that the full process of certification for even a variant of an existing aircraft can take years. One advantage JetZero has in this area is that the plane will initially borrow engines from today\u2019s narrowbody aircraft, like the Boeing 737 \u2014 although the plan is to eventually move to completely emission-free propulsion powered by hydrogen, which would require new engines that haven\u2019t yet been developed. JetZero hasn\u2019t announced any orders for its plane, but O\u2019Leary told CNN last year that airlines are interested. \u201cWe\u2019re talking to all the major airlines globally already, because they\u2019re excited to hear about the efficiency gains.\u201d It remains to be seen whether a 50% reduction in fuel use is actually possible. Both NASA and Airbus quoted a more modest 20% for their designs, while the US Air Force says a blended wing aircraft could \u201cimprove aerodynamic efficiency by at least 30% over current Air Force tanker and mobility aircraft.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that while a blended wing body can reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency, the actual benefits depend on the specific design, configuration, and operational conditions,\u201d says Bailey Miles, an aviation analyst at consulting firm AviationValues. \u201cExtensive aerodynamic testing and optimization are essential to fully realize the drag reduction potential of this innovative aircraft design. It would be hard to determine a specific percentage fuel reduction without the necessary tests,\u201d he adds. According to \ufeffMiles, the blended wing design is a \u201crevolutionary\u201d idea that has potential, but it comes with a number of hurdles, specifically an increased aerodynamic complexity that can make design and testing tricky, a series of regulatory and certification challenges, and a shape that may not be suitable for existing airport infrastructure. \u201cThe blended wing body aircraft holds immense promise as a game changer in the aviation industry, offering the potential for improved fuel efficiency, enhanced payload capacity, and innovative control systems. However, addressing the aerodynamic complexities, ensuring structural integrity, navigating regulatory hurdles, and adapting airport infrastructure are formidable challenges that must be overcome for it to become a reality,\u201d he says, adding that these challenges, among others, make JetZero\u2019s target of 2030 for entry into service \u201cinconceivable.\u201d According to Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at consulting firm Aerodynamic Advisory, while not all of JetZero\u2019s claims can be verified, \u201cthe idea of a blended wing body has been quite appealing for years, and it sounds like they\u2019ve done some very interesting research. My colleagues and I regard it as quite promising.\u201d He is concerned that the firm is mostly \u201ca design shop\u201d at the moment, but he believes that the project may take off with the help of contractors. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly room for somebody who actually wants to add value in this industry,\u201d he says.", "articleSection": ["travel"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Jacopo Prisco", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/jacopo-prisco"}], "dateModified": "2024-04-04T09:57:58.372Z", "description": "Boeing and Airbus have explored designs for blended wing aircraft \u2013 now California-based JetZero aims to put one into service by 2030.", "headline": "JetZero: Groundbreaking \u2018blended-wing\u2019 demonstrator plane cleared to fly", "image": [{"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230818094951-jetzero-design-coastline.jpg?c=original", "caption": "Blended wing aircraft could slash carbon emissions.

Nearly 30 years later, the Shenzhen-based firm has become the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of electric vehicles (EVs), even surpassing American giant Tesla (TSLA) in global sales of pure-play electric cars in the last quarter of 2023. But the two companies are still running neck and neck, with Tesla regaining its crown in the first quarter of 2024. Here\u2019s how they compare, in four charts: Most valuable carmakers Tesla stock was priced at $17 a share when it listed in June 2010. Nearly 14 years later, the company\u2019s shares trade above $166, giving it a market capitalization of about $560 billion, making it the most valuable car company in the world. It\u2019s also among the biggest companies globally by market value. As for BYD, its $81 billion market cap places it among the top 10 automakers in the world, according to Murthy\u00a0Grandhi, business fundamentals analyst at GlobalData, a data and analytics company in London. Still, it trails far behind Tesla and other car makers like Toyota (TM) and Stellantis (STLA), a conglomerate created from the 2021 merger of French PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The group sells cars under 14 brands, including Chrysler, Citro\u00ebn, Jeep, Maserati and Peugeot. But BYD has already surpassed BMW and Ford (F) and is catching up to Mercedes-Benz and Ferrari (RACE). In 2023, Tesla sold around 230,000 more cars than BYD. But the gap has been narrowing from 400,000 in 2022 and 600,000 in 2021. And in the last quarter of 2023, BYD hit a major milestone: selling more battery electric vehicles (BEVs) than Musk\u2019s company did globally, due in part to a slowdown for Tesla in one of its biggest markets, China, and to a general deceleration in demand for EVs. However, the Chinese company stumbled in early 2024. It sold only 300,114 BEVs in the first quarter, down from the 525,409 it sold in the final three months of last year. That drop was big enough for Tesla, which sold 386,810 BEVs in the same period, to retake its former position despite posting plunging sales. Slashing prices BYD\u2019s competitive pricing has helped propel its rise to the top of EV charts, especially compared to Tesla\u2019s pricier cars. But for both, competition in the world\u2019s largest car market is heating up. On March 4, BYD launched a new version of one of its best-selling models, the Yuan Plus crossover, known as Atto 3 outside China, and slashed the price of its predecessor by 11% to 119,800 yuan ($16,644). A few days later, BYD also cut the cost of the newest version of its cheapest car, the Seagull, by 5%. It now has a starting price under $10,000. Although Tesla also cut prices on some models in China last year, the Model 3 and Model Y still sell for more than double BYD\u2019s prices. China is Tesla\u2019s biggest market after the United States and accounted for 33% of global sales in 2023, according to UK-based consultancy firm Rho Motion. The American company started production at its Shanghai Gigafactory in 2019. Last year, that facility, which is Tesla\u2019s main export hub, delivered 947,000 cars. BYD doesn\u2019t sell cars in the United States although it does have a bus manufacturing plant in California. Both Tesla and BYD are expanding beyond their home markets and investing in factories abroad. Going global In 2023, a total of 13.6 million EVs (including BEVs and hybrids) were sold worldwide, an increase of more than 30% over the previous year.\u00a0The Chinese market grew by around 30% last year with 7.9 million units sold. Similar growth is anticipated in 2024, with sales expected to reach 10 million in China alone, says Rho Motion. BYD sold about 3 million electric cars, including hybrids, in 2023 globally. Of that number, 1.6 million were BEVs. By comparison, Tesla, which does not sell hybrids, delivered a total of 1.8 million vehicles worldwide last year, which was about 19% of the global market for BEVs. The United States and Canada bought around 700,000 of Tesla\u2019s vehicles, while 600,000 were sold in China. European sales accounted for about 400,000 vehicles. Tesla\u2019s shares are down 29% so far this year, while BYD stock is down almost 6%.", "articleSection": ["business", "cars"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosa deAcostaNoya", "url": ""}], "dateModified": "2024-04-03T17:59:09.707Z", "description": "The Shenzhen-based firm has become the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of electric vehicles (EVs), having surpassed American giant Tesla in global sales in the last quarter of 2023.

The transaction, which would amount to the largest US foreign military sale to Israel since the country went to war with Hamas on October 7, comes as the administration is also expected to notify Congress soon of a large new sale of precision-guided munitions kits to Israel, the people said. The new sales of some of the US\u2019 most sophisticated weaponry underscore the extent to which the US continues to support Israel militarily, even as Biden administration officials criticize Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza, which have killed more than 32,000 Palestinians since October, according to the Gaza ministry of health. The sale is likely to be hotly debated in Congress, particularly by members of the president\u2019s own party. US weapons sales to Israel have come under intense scrutiny in recent months and Democratic lawmakers have called for restricting military aid to Israeli until it allows more humanitarian aid into Gaza and does more to protect civilians there. Since Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel in October, which killed over 1,200 Israelis, the US has made more than 100 foreign military sales to Israel. Most of those have fallen under the specific dollar amount that requires a notification to Congress, an official familiar with the matter previously told CNN. But an $18 billion F-15 sale is large enough that it requires congressional notification, and the administration informally notified the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations committees of the F-15 sale in late January, according to two of the people familiar with the matter. The informal notification gives lawmakers and congressional staff time to review the details and ask questions before the State Department sends a formal notification to all lawmakers. The top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. James Risch, has already given his approval on the sale, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.\u00a0A congressional aide told CNN that House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul has also approved the transaction to proceed to formal congressional notification. But Sen. Ben Cardin, the Democratic chairman of the committee, as well as the Democratic ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs committee, Rep. Greg Meeks, can still hold up the sale if they raise objections. If there are no objections, the State Department will send a formal notification to all lawmakers, who will then have 30 days to block the sale via a joint resolution of disapproval. Congress has never successfully blocked a proposed arms sale through such a resolution, which has to be passed by both chambers, according to the Congressional Research Service. There are also growing concerns among Democrats over the Biden administration\u2019s continued practice of sharing intelligence with Israel, which was expanded on President Joe Biden\u2019s orders in the wake of the October 7 attack by Hamas. Some of that intelligence support has been in the form of so-called raw intelligence that Israel is meant to use to locate hostages, but could also be used to identify Hamas targets, some sources told CNN. Hamas fighters are often embedded in civilian areas, officials have said. Meanwhile, a growing number of\u00a0US diplomats are becoming frustrated over the administration\u2019s reluctance to use its leverage over Israel to change their approach to the ongoing war. \u201cWhat you hear about the frustrations within the administration over the Israel policy, it is real,\u201d one US diplomat told CNN on condition of anonymity. \u201cWe are being asked to act in a way that ignores what we are seeing on the ground.\u201d The diplomats also told CNN they were frustrated with the administration\u2019s attempts to downplay the US abstention from a UN vote last week on a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. What could have been a bold message to Israel was diluted by the US insisting the resolution was non-binding and consistent with existing US policy, these diplomats said. These disaffected diplomats said they would like to see the US threaten future arms sales to Israel to help curtail the bloody fighting, but the proposed F-15 and precision-guided munitions sales indicate that the administration is not planning to restrict military assistance any time soon. F-15s won\u2019t be delivered immediately Unlike the precision guided munitions, the new F-15s would need to be built from scratch.\u00a0A US official said there are no plans to expedite delivery of the jets to Israel so, if approved, they would not be delivered to Israel for at least five years. Israeli officials have been urging the US to expedite the timeline if possible, CNN previously reported. Along with up to 50 individual jets, the package also includes engines, gun systems, radars and navigation systems for the jets, three of the sources said. The package provides construction and contractor support and logistical infrastructure for training, sustainment, and maintenance of the fleet, as well as a mid-life update for Israel\u2019s current fleet of F-15s. A State Department spokesperson said, \u201cWe are unable to confirm potential or pending US arms transfers before they are formally notified to Congress.\u201d The Biden administration also quietly authorized a sale of F-35 fighter jets to Israel last week, the sources said. That sale did not require congressional notification because the intended sale was already notified to Congress in 2008. The State Department spokesperson said that \u201cas a matter of practicality, major procurements, like Israel\u2019s F-35 program for example, are often broken out into several cases over many years.\u201d Sources told CNN that it was unclear why the Biden administration would approve such a large sale now, during an election year when the president\u2019s policy towards Israel is under a microscope. The sale is not particularly urgent, given that Israel won\u2019t be getting the jets for another few years, anyway. Josh Paul, who worked in the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs for over a decade before resigning in October over the US\u2019 ongoing arms transfers to Israel, said the US clearly thinks Israel needs the equipment \u201cfor its long-term defense.\u201d \u201cBut there is a sense on Israel\u2019s side that right now the doors are wide open for anything they want, so this is the time to ask for it,\u201d he said. \u201cWho knows how long the barn doors will be open for?\u201d The Israeli Embassy in Washington, DC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN about the proposed sales. \u201cThe United States has a decades-long commitment to Israel\u2019s security,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday. \u201cIsrael is surrounded by entities that are sworn to its destruction, not just Hamas, but Iran and proxy groups that Iran sponsors, Hezbollah among them, who have repeatedly talked about their desire for the destruction of Israel. We believe Israel has every right to defend itself against those opponents.\u201d Growing concerns about US intelligence sharing When it comes to intelligence sharing with Israel, the US has offered the Israeli government a significant amount of processing capacity, according to two sources familiar with the matter \u2014 essentially, computing power that allows Israel to sift through mass amounts of intercepts, imagery and other raw intelligence to extract meaningful trends or insights. In theory, the intelligence community is not allowed to share information with partners that would be used to violate the international laws of armed conflict, and US officials insist that they are not giving Israel what\u2019s known as \u201ctargeting intelligence\u201d; in this case, intelligence used to target precise Hamas fighters or positions. Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in November that the US military is \u201cnot participating\u00a0in IDF target development,\u201d and that their involvement is solely intended to help find the hostages. But several sources familiar with US sharing efforts who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity said that is a distinction without a difference. Once the US provides a piece of intelligence to Israel, it has no control over how Israel combines it with other information, and there\u2019s nothing to stop Israel from using that information to target Hamas operatives, the sources said. \u201cIsrael provides assurances that operations making use of U.S. intelligence are conducted in a manner consistent with international law, including the Law of Armed Conflict, which calls for the protection of civilians,\u201d a senior intelligence official told CNN in response to questions about the intelligence sharing. The intelligence has continued to flow, sources said, even as the Biden administration has been pressing Israel to do more to prevent civilian casualties. \u201cAbsent stronger oversight, it is impossible to discern how allies and partners are using U.S. intelligence in military operations,\u201d Steven Katz, a former Army officer currently working as a civilian in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, wrote in a piece on the national security blog Just Security, advocating for greater congressional oversight of intelligence sharing. \u201cIn certain cases, the IC may be providing indirect support through intelligence sharing for partner operations conducted in a manner inconsistent with U.S. law and policy,\u201d he said. The State Department has a process in place to investigate reports that civilians have been killed by US weapons wielded by other nations, according to Katz, but no law exists requiring the intelligence community to track how US intelligence-sharing may contribute to civilian deaths. A provision in an annual intelligence bill now before Congress would require the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to submit an annual report to Congress detailing civilian casualties caused by foreign government operations in which US-shared intelligence played a \u201csignificant role.\u201d But that bill has yet to be passed.

It\u2019s a milestone moment in the highly anticipated new era of supersonic travel. The XB-1, a technology demonstrator aircraft built by Colorado-based Boom Supersonic, successfully completed its first test flight at the Mojave Air & Space Port in California, it was announced March 22. The XB-1 is the the world\u2019s first independently developed supersonic jet and paves the way for the development of Boom\u2019s commercial plane Overture. Now, 10 years after the Boom Supersonic project began in 2014, CEO Blake Scholl tells CNN Travel over video call, there are an exciting few months ahead. The \u2018hard part\u2019 is over \u201cI very much believe in the return of supersonic air travel, and ultimately to bring it to every passenger on every route. And that\u2019s not something that takes place overnight,\u201d says Scholl. \u201cThe hard part of building a supersonic jet is making something that\u2019s so sleek, and so slippery, take off and land safely.\u201d XB-1\u2019s first flight met all of its test objectives, including safely reaching an altitude of 7,120 feet (2,170 meters) and speeds of up to 238 knots (273 miles per hour). That\u2019s quite a bit below the altitudes reached by commercial airliners, which fly between 31,000 feet to 42,000 feet. As for Mach 1 \u2013 the speed of sound \u2013\u00a0 that\u2019s about 760 mph, depending on altitude and temperature. But the plan is for XB-1 to achieve that supersonic ambition pretty fast. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna be doing a whole series of flights \u2013 10 to 15 total \u2013 over the next five to seven months to break the sound barrier for the first time,\u201d says Scholl. Aerodynamics, materials, propulsion There have been only two civil supersonic planes: the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 and the British-French Concorde, which flew for the last time in October 2003, more than two decades ago. Now, the industry is abuzz with supersonic and hypersonic projects \u2013 from NASA and Lockheed Martin\u2019s \u201cquiet\u201d X-59 aircraft, which limits sonic boom, to Atlanta-based Hermeus, which this week unveiled its first flyable aircraft. \u201cThe advent of digital engineering is a huge enabler for why supersonic flight\u2019s coming back,\u201d explains Scholl. \u201cAerodynamics, materials, propulsion: Those are the big three areas where we\u2019ve made huge progress versus Concorde.\u201d Computational fluid dynamics Back in the 1960s, Concorde was developed in wind tunnels, which meant building costly physical models, running tests, then repeat. \u201cYou just can\u2019t test very many designs, when every iteration costs millions and takes months,\u201d explains Scholl. But Boom has perfected its aircraft\u2019s efficient, aerodynamic design using computational fluid dynamics, which \u201cis basically a digital wind tunnel. We can run the equivalent of hundreds of wind tunnel tests overnight in simulation for a fraction of the cost of a real wind tunnel test.\u201d XB-1 is made almost entirely from carbon fiber composites, selected for being both strong and lightweight. Augmented reality vision system Concorde famously reduced drag when reaching supersonic speeds by having a long, pointed nose on a hinge that tilted forward when taking off, landing and taxiing so the pilots could see the runway. \u201cToday, we have this amazing thing called a camera and a screen,\u201d says Scholl with a smile, when explaining XB-1\u2019s unique augmented reality vision system. Rather than needing a complex moveable nose and windscreen views, the craft instead makes use of two nose-mounted cameras, digitally augmented with altitude and flight path indications. \u201cIt\u2019s far better than the view ever was on Concorde,\u201d claims Scholl, and the augmented reality symbology will help pilots line up the target and achieve \u201ca beautiful landing every time.\u201d Fueled by SAF So, with the aviation industry having a target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, where does a supersonic plane whizzing round at twice the speed of modern, conventional jets fit into all this? Overture is designed to be powered by conventional jet engines and to run on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). We\u2019ve covered the so-far slow adoption of SAF before here on CNN Travel, and Scholl is well aware of its current problems. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough of it, and it costs too much, but it is scaling,\u201d says Scholl, but he reckons that one day it\u2019ll be used for all long-haul air travel. It\u2019s the \u201cfuture of aviation,\u201d he declares. The need for speed Scholl concedes that \u201cflying faster is inherently more energy intensive,\u201d but argues that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t have to choose between climate-friendly and passenger-friendly. In fact, we can accelerate the transition towards lower carbon transportation by making sure that the most desirable airplane is also the most climate-friendly.\u201d He compares today\u2019s transatlantic air travel to \u201cdriving across the Atlantic in a not-very-good SUV. Aboard Overture, driving across the Atlantic is gonna be like driving a Tesla across it. And yeah, it\u2019s gonna be more energy-intensive, but from a climate perspective, it doesn\u2019t matter because the energy source is green.\u201d \u2018If we have faster airplanes, we don\u2019t need as many\u2019 He also argues the case for other efficiencies offered by faster flight. \u201cA faster airplane is much more human-efficient, and it\u2019s much more capital-efficient. You can do more flights, with the same airplane and crew,\u201d says Scholl. \u201cWe can significantly reduce all of the cost and impact that goes into airplanes by making them faster. if we have faster airplanes, we don\u2019t need as many.\u201d The reason we don\u2019t use propeller flights between London and New York, he says, is that while it might be less energy-intensive than a jet engine, it would be \u201cmore expensive and more impactful overall, because going at half the speed you would need way more.\u201d He predicts that, in the same manner jet airplanes replaced propeller airplanes, \u201cin your lifetime and mine, supersonic is going to replace today\u2019s jet airliners, and it\u2019s going to be both faster, more sustainable, and more affordable.\u201d \u2018Anywhere in the world in four hours for $100\u2019 Back when CNN Travel spoke with Scholl in May 2021, he told us his dream was for people to one day be able to \u201cfly anywhere in the world in four hours for $100.\u201d Three years later, he says it\u2019s still his \u201cNorth Star.\u201d \u201cIf you look back at Concorde, you know, built out of 1960s technology, this was like a 20,000 quid ticket, and it just wasn\u2019t attainable,\u201d says Scholl. On the first iteration of Boom\u2019s Overture plane, dubbed Overture One, \u201cour goal is to cut that by a factor of four, and be able to have supersonic flight available to the tens of millions of people who can fly business class today.\u201d The long-term vision is for later versions of Overture - there\u2019s plans for Overture Two, then Overture Three \u2013 will bring supersonic flights on more routes to more passengers at lower costs. Boom\u2019s goal is to cut flights to \u201chalf the time or less than it takes today.\u201d The ultimate goal is \u201cflights that are faster, more affordable, more convenient, more sustainable. And we\u2019re just gonna keep working on that until we can travel effortlessly around the planet.\u201d 2024 is \u2018one of the biggest years yet\u2019 Boom aims to carry its first passengers on Overture \u2013 between 64 and 80 of them, at Mach 1.7 \u2013 before the end of the decade. Presently, it boasts an order book of 130 orders and pre-orders from customers including American Airlines, United Airlines and Japan Airlines. Scholl says, \u201c2024 is going to be one of the biggest years yet for supersonic flight. Later this year, we\u2019ll open the super-factory in Greensboro, North Carolina, where we\u2019re going to be building Overture.

I am the backup plan.\u201d Now Boeing needs a backup to the backup. The foundations of Boeing and its culture have not improved enough under Calhoun\u2019s leadership. Monday\u2019s\u00a0announcement\u00a0that he would leave Boeing at the end of the year marks an important inflection point for the once-great aerospace company and an opportunity to change its direction. But an important question persists: Who should take over as CEO of Boeing? What does the portrait of an ideal leader for Boeing look like? At its foundation, the board of directors needs to select the new CEO based on three criteria: Boeing\u2019s new CEO needs to signal change, embody the company they want Boeing to become and be driven\u00a0by the goal of\u00a0leaving a positive legacy. Boeing\u2019s new CEO needs to signal change. Much like when the tech industry adopted the\u00a0hoodie to signal an intention to do things differently, the aerospace giant needs its own iconic look, and this could be its opportunity. When employees, regulators and the public meet the new CEO, they need to see change. Those characteristics could be the way the new CEO speaks, the way they look, the background they have, the way they dress or their attitude. The current baseline to overcome is easy to spot: an older corporate veteran from\u00a0General Electric with a degree in accounting wearing a black suit and tie. While it\u2019s easy to say that optics shouldn\u2019t matter, they do, and they can have a powerful effect. Imagine a 40-something nerdy engineer with a long-term orientation who is able to stand up to Wall Street and the board of directors to take the pressure off immediate performance. Boeing\u2019s new CEO needs to embody the company\u00a0the board wants Boeing to become. If the board of directors wants to see the same \u2014 a relentless focus on profitability,\u00a0$59 billion\u00a0returned to shareholders over a decade,\u00a0crashes, safety incidents\u00a0and disdain from the public \u2014 we know what that looks like. On the other hand, if the board wants the company to return to its image as an engineering and manufacturing powerhouse with an intense focus on innovation and quality, we also know what that looks like. That\u2019s an aerospace engineer who has designed planes, a mechanical engineer who has manufactured planes or a product quality manager who has inspected planes. That person\u00a0wants\u00a0to walk around the engineering labs, stroll the manufacturing floor, visit customers\u2019 airplane hangars and sit through quality meetings. They must be able to \u201cspeak\u201d engineering. With an engineering background, they would have the capability and the mandate to lead a change back to the company\u2019s roots and shrug off the short-termism that I believe is the source of its woes. This is not the time to hire an executive with experience in crisis management, cost accounting or political lobbying. This is a time to hire the leader who can actually lead a technology and manufacturing giant, not allow it to limp along from crisis to crisis. Boeing\u2019s new CEO needs to be driven by leaving a positive legacy, where the company is in a purposeful state and has the momentum to sustain its competitive advantage long after their departure. It\u2019s about the future success of the company, not\u00a0current gains. If the new CEO needs a blueprint of what their legacy could look like, they need only read up on the not-so-recent\u00a0history\u00a0of Boeing. They will read about massive technological advancements, deep manufacturing expertise and the ability to dream. The stories will describe senior managers walking the factory and engineering floors, all while being financially successful. Through Boeing\u2019s own history, they can envision a talented, excited employee base working together in open dialog to build iconic products. This CEO is out there. What I have described is not a corporate unicorn. The worst thing Boeing\u2019s board could do would be to settle on more of the same. The company and the public need change.", "articleSection": ["opinions"], "author": [], "dateModified": "2024-03-27T14:25:22.406Z", "description": "Boeing\u2019s new CEO needs to signal change, embody the company the board wants Boeing to become and be driven\u00a0by the goal of\u00a0leaving a positive legacy, writes Tim Hubbard.", "headline": "Opinion: Boeing\u2019s new boss should drop the suit and consider a hoodie", "image": [{"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2112557249.jpg?c=original", "caption": "The exterior of the Boeing Company headquarters is seen on March 25, 2024 in Arlington, Virginia.", "sourceOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Getty Images"}, "width": "3000", "height": "1913", "creditText": "Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images", "dateCreated": "2024-03-25T04:00:00.000Z"}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/timothy-david-hubbard.JPG?c=original", "caption": "Tim Hubbard", "sourceOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Tim Hubbard"}, "width": "2400", "height": "3000", "creditText": "University of Notre Dame", "dateCreated": "2017-08-11T04:00:00.000Z"}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2112557249.jpg?c=original", "caption": "The exterior of the Boeing Company headquarters is seen on March 25, 2024 in Arlington, Virginia.", "sourceOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Getty Images"}, "width": "3000", "height": "1913", "creditText": "Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images", "dateCreated": "2024-03-25T04:00:00.000Z"}], "thumbnailUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2112557249.jpg?c=original", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@context": "https://schema.org", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/27/opinions/boeing-ceo-leader-board-hubbard/index.html", "dateModified": "2024-03-27T14:25:22.406Z", "inLanguage": "en", "additionalType": "article_leaf", "publisher": {"@type": "NewsMediaOrganization", "name": "CNN", "logo": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61", "foundingDate": "1980-06-01", "url": "https://www.cnn.com", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/cnn/", "https://twitter.com/CNN", "https://www.instagram.com/cnn/", "https://www.youtube.com/cnn"]}, "name": "Opinion: Boeing\u2019s new boss should drop the suit and consider a hoodie", "headline": "Opinion: Boeing\u2019s new boss should drop the suit and consider a hoodie", "description": "Boeing\u2019s new CEO needs to signal change, embody the company the board wants Boeing to become and be driven\u00a0by the goal of\u00a0leaving a positive legacy, writes Tim Hubbard.", "datePublished": "2024-03-27T13:38:02.359Z"}, "publisher": {"@type": "NewsMediaOrganization", "name": "CNN", "logo": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61", "foundingDate": "1980-06-01", "url": "https://www.cnn.com", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/cnn/", "https://twitter.com/CNN", "https://www.instagram.com/cnn/", "https://www.youtube.com/cnn"]}, "timeRequired": "P0Y0M0DT0H3M4S", "wordCount": 691, "datePublished": "2024-03-27T13:38:02.359Z", "isAccessibleForFree": false, "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": false, "cssSelector": ".article__content"}}, {"@type": "NewsArticle", "@context": "https://schema.org", "articleBody": "Since its founding by William Boeing more than a century ago, the Boeing Company has had 12 CEOs. The 13th might be the most important yet. As Boeing begins its search for a new CEO, the company is facing its worst-ever crisis. It has struggled through more than five years of safety incidents and bad news that  created unprecedented doubt about the quality of its aircraft. It faces multiple federal investigations into its commercial plane practices, as well as an outcry from the airline customers that buy its planes. In addition to two fatal crashes that cost 346 lives, the company has run up more than $31 billion in losses since 2019, with no end to the red ink in sight. It has grabbed unwanted attention with incidents like a blown-out door plug that left a gaping hole in an Alaska Airlines flight in January. Those incidents were followed by Monday\u2019s decision by the current CEO, Dave Calhoun, to step down by the end of the year, leaving the company to search for a new chief executive. What Boeing wants in its new CEO When picking a new CEO, the company likely has two pools of choices. It can go with someone who has an engineering background, as was the background of many of the past CEOs who led the company in its heyday. Four of the company\u2019s first five CEOs were engineers by training, running the company for 46 of the first 70 years of Boeing\u2019s existence. Or it can once again pick a leader like outgoing CEO Calhoun, who has a financial background and an undergraduate degree in accounting. Critics have said an increased focus on financial results over engineering excellence over the last 25 years has led to the company\u2019s current problems. Some say it\u2019s crucial that Boeing get back to its engineering roots in its next CEO. \u201cTo fix Boeing\u2019s issues the company needs a strong engineering lead as its head coupled to a governance model which prioritizes safety and quality,\u201d said Sir Tim Clark, president of Emirates Airlines, which ordered 373 planes from Boeing since 2009, but only two of those since 2019. \u201cWhether, yet again, this changing of the guard will resolve Boeing\u2019s issues only time will tell, but time, unfortunately, is not on their side.\u201d In an interview with CNBC on Monday morning, Calhoun was asked about what he wants to see in his successor. \u201cI want somebody who knows how to handle a big, long, long-cycle business like ours,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the production of the airplane. It\u2019s the development of the next airplane. It will be a $50 billion investment. I would like somebody who clearly has the experience inside our industry.\u201d Calhoun did not give any potential names, or say whether Boeing is looking more at internal or outside candidates. But a number of potential choices are surfacing, according to Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. Pat Shanahan Pat Shanahan is the \u201ctop of the list,\u201d according to Aboulafia. A former Boeing executive for 31 years, he became known as \u201cMr. Fix It\u201d at the company for dealing with various problems during his tenure. He was deputy secretary of the US Department of Defense under President Donald Trump and was nominated to be secretary, serving nearly six months in an acting capacity in 2019. His name was withdrawn before his confirmation due to media reports involving domestic incidents involving violent actions by his son and ex-wife. He has held a number of different posts in the years since, and in September became CEO of Boeing\u2019s major supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, which makes the fuselages for the Boeing 737 Max among other items. Spirit AeroSystems faces its own safety and quality issues, which have caused problems for Boeing, forcing temporary halts of production on some jets. But most of those problems occurred before Shanahan took the CEO job there. Boeing is in talks to reacquire Spirit, the companies confirmed, which would be something of a homecoming. Spirit was part of Boeing before the larger company spun it off in 2005. If Boeing acquires Spirit, it\u2019s possible Shanahan would be tapped as Boeing\u2019s next CEO as part of the merger. Most of the companies where candidates mentioned in this story now work declined to comment when questioned by CNN or did not respond to a request for comment. Spirit was the only one to comment, but it did not address the possibility of Shanahan becoming Boeing CEO. \u201cMr. Shanahan remains solely focused on driving a zero-defects culture across all aspects of Spirit AeroSystems,\u201d said Joe Buccino, a Spirit spokesperson. Larry Culp Larry Culp has already turned around one major American industrial icon, becoming  CEO of General Electric in 2018 and spinning off many of the company\u2019s parts. One of the parts that remains is GE Aerospace, which makes engines used on Boeing jets and other planes. Under its longtime CEO Jack Welch, GE grew to corporate success with a strong focus on cutting costs to improve financial performance. Three of the last four Boeing CEOs, including Calhoun, spent part of their careers at GE. Some Boeing critics say those CEOs\u2019 emphasis on the GE playbook of cost cutting, profitability and shareholders rewards rather than quality was the source of much of Boeing\u2019s current problems. But Culp has moved GE away from the Jack Welch era, a time when Calhoun and some of the other earlier Boeing CEOs cut their teeth, said Aboulafia. Culp joined GE as an outsider in 2018 after spending 24 years at Danaher Corp., moving up the ranks to CEO from 2000 to 2014. Many industrial analysts believe Danaher, during Culp\u2019s tenure, outperformed GE and many other manufacturing and industrial companies during that time. Culp has an undergraduate degree in economics and an MBA from Harvard, a business background more than an engineering background. \u201cI know he\u2019s done incredibly well at Danaher and GE. This is a new GE. Culp is being very open to being transformative,\u201d he said. \u201cThey needed to escape from that Jack Welch culture. What looks like a negative is actually a positive.\u201d GE did not comment when asked about whether Culp would be interested in the Boeing job. Kathy Warden Kathy Warden has had a lot of success as CEO of Northrop Grumman since she  began in the company\u2019s top job at the start of 2019. The military contractor\u2019s revenues have grown 30% during that period. Its stock price has nearly doubled under her tenure. And while Northrop doesn\u2019t make commercial jets, Boeing is also a major defense contractor in addition to a commercial aircraft maker. Warden has an MBA and worked at GE for a decade and two other industrial companies before joining Northrop. \u201cThat\u2019s a wonderful idea,\u201d Aboulafia said. \u201cI don\u2019t now how you\u2019d convince her to make that leap, but she\u2019d be perfect.\u201d One reason that the Boeing board might be interested in her, besides her success, is what\u2019s known as the \u201cglass cliff\u201d phenomenon, in which companies, especially those in male dominated fields like tech or manufacturing, are more open to looking at women CEOs when they\u2019re in trouble. Think of General Motors picking Mary Barra to be the first woman to run a major global automaker just before a major crisis \u2014 the ignition switch problem that killed more than 100 drivers and passengers and cost the company billions \u2014 became public. Sometimes the new woman CEO is not as successful as Barra in steering the company through the crisis, and thus a woman who has shattered the \u201cglass ceiling\u201d finds herself pushed off the \u201cglass cliff.\u201d Greg Smith Greg Smith left his post as CFO of Boeing soon after the company\u2019s board granted a five-year waiver of the normal retirement age limit of 65 to Calhoun in 2021. Smith, who was 54 at the time, clearly saw his path to the CEO job had been blocked. Since he left, he joined a number of corporate boards, most notably American Airlines, where he serves as chairman. RIght now, one of Boeing\u2019s biggest problems is relations with its airline customers, many of whom are frustrated with repeated missed deadlines to deliver new jets, groundings by regulators and for the quality of the jets it is delivering. One way for the Boeing board to signal it is listening to those customer concerns would be to name someone who now is on the airlines\u2019 side of that crucial relationship but who also has experience with Boeing. That describes Smith. But picking him would also mean another CEO with a finance background rather than an engineering background. Alan Mulally Aboulafia suggested there could be a number of executives who have left Boeing who might be good fits if they could come back, although their age could be an issue. At the top of that list is Alan Mulally. He was a long-time veteran of the Boeing Commercial Airplane unit, rising to be its CEO. He left Boeing in 2006 to become CEO of Ford. At the time, Ford was struggling more than the other Detroit automakers, GM and DaimlerChrysler, as Chrysler was then known. Mulally helped turn around the company, which allowed Ford to be the only Detroit automaker to avoid a federal bailout and bankruptcy, as GM and Chrysler experienced three years later. He retired from Ford in 2014 with a nest egg worth nearly $300 million thanks to the turnaround the stock experienced during his eight years on the job. Mulally has degrees in aeronautical engineering and in management. It\u2019s not clear if Mulally, now 78, would want to come out of retirement for a challenge as big as turning around Boeing. He did not respond to an email from CNN about the job on Monday. It\u2019s also not clear if the Boeing board would consider someone that old. But in a year in which the US presidential election appears likely to pit an 81-year old candidate versus a 77-year old candidate, it seems tough to argue a well respected 78-year-old is too old to run Boeing. Internal candidates Normally, internal candidates might be seen as the likely picks to replace Calhoun. Most of the 12 CEOs in Boeing\u2019s history were internal candidates, with Calhoun being an exception. However, the problems at Boeing during the last five years could lead the board to give preference to outside candidates. \u201cBoeing is in need of drastic cultural overall, which is\u00a0cultivated from the top, but sprouts from the bottom,\u201d said Bank of America aerospace analyst Ron Epstein in a note to clients Monday. \u201cWe see the changes [announced Monday] as the first right steps of removing the\u00a0\u2018old guard\u2019 and making way for a new team which can work from a less sullied slate.\u201d But among the internal candidates who might be considered are Stephanie Pope, who has been rising rapidly at Boeing and was promoted to chief operating officer just this past January. She was then promoted to CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes on Monday. Another internal candidate could be CFO Brian West, another GE veteran, having served as CFO of GE Aviation and CFO GE Engine Services before coming to Boeing. Both Pope and West come from a finance background, not an engineering background. It\u2019s also possible that Boeing could tap Elizabeth Lund, who is senior vice president of quality at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, a new position that was created just a month ago. She does have an engineering background and experience dealing with Boeing suppliers, a major issue for the company\u2019s efforts to get back on track. \u201cI don\u2019t know her, but she\u2019s well regarded,\u201d Aboulafia said. A Boeing spokesperson declined to provide any comments on behalf of any of the internal candidates.", "articleSection": ["business"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Chris Isidore", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/chris-isidore"}], "dateModified": "2024-03-27T10:00:32.382Z", "description": "Since its founding by William Boeing more than a century ago, the Boeing Company has had 12 CEOs.

And when your company does badly, you get extra money to encourage you to stick around and lead it through the storm. What a deal! And at some point, you get to bow out and float toward retirement on your golden parachute, which means \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 more money. That\u2019s the dream awaiting Dave Calhoun, the CEO of Boeing, who is preparing to retire after four years at the helm, during which he failed to fix the company\u2019s biggest problems around safety and quality control that burned its reputation with customers. By the time he steps down at the end of this year, he\u2019ll be 67 years old and poised to collect millions of dollars on top of the many millions he\u2019s already made as CEO. There\u2019s a certain dark irony in Calhoun pulling the metaphorical ripcord now, while Boeing is flailing, though it\u2019s hard to imagine a scenario in which he got to keep his job in the midst of cascading mishaps and near-disasters over the past three months. Exactly how much Calhoun will receive isn\u2019t clear yet, as it depends on how Boeing\u2019s stock performs. A Boeing spokesperson said that details of his compensation will be shared in company filings in the coming weeks. But we already know that Calhoun has made about $63 million over the past three years in total compensation, according to regulatory filings. That includes a $1.4 million base salary, plus millions in stock-based incentives. According to Boeing\u2019s most recent proxy statement, Calhoun is set to walk away with about $15 million worth of stock, cash and options in retirement. But that doesn\u2019t account for incentives along the way that could boost his potential future earnings. One estimate, according to Fortune, suggests Calhoun could walk away with $24 million, with the potential to collect $45.5 million more if Boeing\u2019s stock goes up 37%. That gives Calhoun a pretty hefty incentive to choose his successor carefully. If history is any guide, Calhoun could have done a much worse job and still made out startlingly well. His predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, was fired over his mishandling of Boeing\u2019s response to two crashes that killed 346 people. And while Muilenburg was denied severance pay, he still walked away with $80 million worth of stock and other assets. Post-Muilenburg, the board tapped one of their own to take over. Calhoun, an accountant by training and a longtime Boeing director, ascended as CEO in January of 2020 with a message that Boeing would be getting back to its roots and focusing on safety and quality. The honeymoon period didn\u2019t last long. Even as the board heaped praise on Calhoun, Boeing\u2019s own customers started sounding off about their frustrations with the leadership. In 2022, the CEO of Ryanair said \u201cBoeing management is running around like headless chickens,\u201d and that executives needed an immediate \u201creboot, or a boot up the a**.\u201d Around the same time, the head of aircraft leasing company Avalon said Boeing had \u201clost its way\u201d and might need\u00a0\u201cfresh leadership.\u201d Under Calhoun, labor relations at Boeing have been badly frayed. The company laid off at least 16,000 employees in response to the pandemic, and moved production of the 787 Dreamliner from its unionized plant in Washington to a non-unionized plant in South Carolina. This summer, more than 30,000 Seattle-area mechanics are set to vote on a strike authorization that could result in a work stoppage when their contract expires in September. Still, Calhoun has held on, thanks to a loyal board and a business model that makes it virtually impossible for Boeing to lose customers or go bankrupt. And once again, Boeing finds itself in a crisis, looking for a new leader to steer it to a safe landing. \u2014CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore contributed reporting.", "articleSection": ["business", "investing"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Allison Morrow", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/allison-morrow"}], "dateModified": "2024-03-26T22:00:29.467Z", "description": "The beauty of being a CEO in America is that when your company does well, you get extra money as a reward.

That a fledgling, unprofitable social media platform can make the former president billions of dollars on paper is a marvel of the stock market. Trump can\u2019t realize the windfall by selling his shares or borrowing against them for six months unless the company\u2019s board, which is packed with his supporters, gives him the OK. It probably can\u2019t get Trump cash soon enough to make the drastically reduced $175 million bond he needs to post for the civil tax fraud charges levied on him and his other companies. Other penalties in that civil fraud decision, including the suspension of Trump\u2019s ability to do business in New York, have been paused for now. The fact that Trump\u2019s newly public company makes little in the way of revenue and loses money should be fair warning to investors.\u00a0In the meantime, he\u2019s also trying to sell \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d Bibles via his social media platform Truth Social for $59.99. Unprofitable and losing users CNN\u2019s Matt Egan points out that the fundamentals of the company are not exactly stellar: \u201cTrump Media generated just $3.4 million of revenue through the first nine months of last year, according to filings. The company\u00a0lost $49 million over that span.\u201d \u201cMy podcast makes a lot more money,\u201d the tech journalist and CNN contributor Kara Swisher told Laura Coates on CNN on Monday. Plus, the company\u2019s main asset, Truth Social, has fewer than 500,000 monthly active users, far less than platforms like Facebook, X or TikTok, and Truth Social is losing more users than larger platforms and is losing users at a faster clip. More from Egan: \u201cFor context, Reddit was only valued at $6.4 billion\u00a0at its IPO last week\u00a0\u2013 even though it generated 160 times more revenue than Trump Media. (Reddit hauled in $804 million in revenue in 2023, compared with Trump Media\u2019s annualized revenue of about $5 million.)\u201d Who is invested? In the case of Trump, the stock could be inflated by his supporters, although the inverse could also true. If Trump unloaded his stock, it could plunge in value because his brand would no longer be associated with it. The top institutional investor in the company is Susquehanna International Group. Its founder, Jeff Yass, is a major donor to Republican causes and also a major investor in ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. Yass and Trump actually met recently, just before Trump reversed his previous position in favor of requiring ByteDance to spin off TikTok. Trump said the subject of TikTok did not come up in his conversation with Yass. Susquehanna International Group did not return a request for comment about the company\u2019s stake in Trump Media & Technology Group. Jordan Libowitz is the communications director for the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, and in a phone conversation, he wondered what might happen if foreign wealth funds that have interests in the US, like those associated with Saudi Arabia or Qatar, started buying large amounts of DJT stock. Since so much of Trump\u2019s wealth is now tied up in the company, those countries could theoretically have a direct impact on his bottom line. \u201cThe value isn\u2019t really in the company,\u201d Libowitz argued, pointing to the company\u2019s lackluster revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s in the Trump name.\u201d Clear ethical issues If Trump wins the White House again and a company bearing his initials are available, it could obviously be a venue for investors to curry favor. It would be an unprecedented situation, although not dissimilar to what happened when Trump was president. While his company was not public during his first term in the White House, the use of his then-Washington, DC, hotel by foreign companies was the subject of lawsuits related to the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause, which bars the president from profiting from a foreign government. Days after Trump left office, the Supreme Court threw out cases related to the Emoluments Clause because he was no longer in office. While Trump no longer owns the DC hotel, the same ethical issues would present themselves if he returns to the White House. But while the effect of throwing business to a president\u2019s hotel ends when someone checks out of their room, the relationship with investors can be much longer lasting. A history of bankruptcy Another note of caution for investors in DJT should the history of the last company Trump took public. Trump\u2019s casino company also went by the ticker DJT, but on the New York Stock Exchange between 1995 and 2004, when it went bankrupt and was delisted. That was actually the third of Trump\u2019s four business bankruptcies. Note: When Trump was talking about the IPO for Trump Media & Technology Group after a court appearance in New York on Monday, he tried to explain why the company would be listed on Nasdaq instead of the NYSE. CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale looked into that claim \u2013 something about how the NYSE is in New York \u2013 and found Trump\u2019s explanation to make no sense, since Nasdaq is also located in New York. Presidents are exempt from ethics law Current law restricts every executive branch employee except the president from having investments that conflict with their job, Kedric Payne, senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center, told me in a phone conversation. It\u2019s something Trump exploited when he said he gave control of his company, the Trump Organization, to his sons during his four years in the White House. Ethics experts balked at the lack of controls and transparency. \u201cIt\u2019s new facts, but the same old problem,\u201d Payne said, adding that the volume of money involved could be much greater with a publicly traded company. \u201cAny action that he takes as president could benefit that company, and he would then have the benefit of the stock price,\u201d Payne said. Shortly after he was elected in 2016, Trump noted that presidents are exempt from ethics laws. \u201cThe president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest,\u201d he told The New York Times. When these laws were written, according to Libowitz, nobody anticipated a president\u2019s name being attached to a large, publicly traded company. That doesn\u2019t mean previous presidents weren\u2019t wealthy, but unlike Trump, they walled their investments off. He\u2019s doing the opposite, making his wealth synonymous with his name and inviting investors. A new \u2018meme\u2019 stock? None of that has stopped what some experts have referred to as a bubble forming around the Trump Media & Technology Group. It is drawing comparisons to so-called \u201cmeme stocks\u201d like GameStop and AMC, which were buoyed for a time by small individual retail investors who poured in so much money that the stocks rapidly outran the companies\u2019 fundamentals.", "articleSection": ["politics"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Zachary B.

DJT, of course, stands for Donald John Trump, underscoring the company\u2019s raison d\u2019etre \u2014 giving a megaphone (and a serious cash infusion) to the presumptive Republican nominee. The company\u2019s main product, Truth Social, was Trump\u2019s quick and dirty solution to his ban on practically every mainstream social media app in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The social media app was never a blockbuster, though, and it\u2019s unclear how the company will ever make money. If that all sounds familiar, that\u2019s because we\u2019ve been down this road before. While Trump Media may be new, its stock ticker is a throwback to Trump\u2019s only other publicly traded company. Trump bestowed the same initials on his Atlantic City casino business, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, back when that company went public in 1995. It didn\u2019t go great. At least, not for investors. Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts never turned a profit and ended up in bankruptcy in 2004, wiping out shareholders. Trump\u2019s company lost money every single year of its existence, putting it more than $600 million in\u00a0the red \u2014 despite owning premier Atlantic City casinos, including the Trump Taj Mahal, a place so opulent Trump called it \u201cthe eighth wonder of the world.\u201d The stock lost 90% its value in its first five years as a public company. Yet Trump himself made out fine. Between 1995 and 2004, Trump took home about $40 million in salary, bonuses and options \u2014 not unusual for a CEO. Then there were the less common moneymaking methods, including consulting contracts, licensing deals and reimbursements for the use of his personal jet and golf courses. Those atypical payments made up about half of the money Trump made during his tenure as the company\u2019s leader. \u201cThe money I took out of there was incredible,\u201d Trump told the New York Times in 2016. Trump\u2019s stock holdings were wiped out in the bankruptcy. But he continued to make millions of dollars from the company after it came out of bankruptcy, pocketing $6.1 million from the re-named Trump Entertainment Resorts company, which traded under a new ticker \u2014 you guessed it! \u2014 TRMP. The new name and ticker didn\u2019t help the company, though. It lost $2 billion over five years and filed for bankruptcy a second time in 2009. Like its predecessor, the new DJT is enjoying some market enthusiasm following the merger between Trump\u2019s media entity and Digital World Acquisition Corp. Shares of DWAC surged 40% Monday and are up over 170% over the past six months. But a look at the fundamentals suggests the stock is wildly overvalued. Trump Media generated just $3.4 million of revenue through the first nine months of last year, according to\u00a0SEC\u00a0filings.  \u201cThe stock price is clearly a bubble,\u201d Yale law professor Jonathan Macey told my colleague Matt Egan last week. \u201cNo rational investor would take the stock at face value, especially if they had to hold it for any length of time.\u201d Meanwhile, Truth Social\u2019s user base is shrinking \u2013 more so than that of X, the company formerly known as Twitter. At current prices, Trump\u2019s stake is valued at about $4 billion. In theory, he\u2019s not allowed to sell that stock for several months after trading begins. But there could be workarounds to that so-called lock-up period, if the company\u2019s board of directors allow it. And the board may be more amenable to green-lighting that now that Trump\u2019s civil fraud bond obligation has shrunk by more than 60%.

Boeing\u2019s chairman and the head of the commercial airplane unit are also leaving. Boeing\u2019s chairman, Larry Kellner, will not stand for re-election as a board director. The board has elected former Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf to succeed him. The company also announced that Stan Deal, CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, is retiring. Stephanie Pope, Boeing\u2019s chief operating officer since January, is taking his place effective immediately. Boeing has been buffeted by more than five years of problems with its airplanes, including two fatal crashes of the 737 Max in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people, and most recently a door plug that blew out of the side of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max in January, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. The problems have led to multiple groundings for safety issues and more than $31 billion in cumulative losses. In a letter to Boeing employees Monday, Calhoun called the Alaska Airlines incident \u201ca watershed moment for Boeing.\u201d \u201cThe eyes of the world are on us,\u201d he said in announcing his departure plans. \u201cWe are going to fix what isn\u2019t working, and we are going to get our company back on the track towards recovery and stability.\u201d The decision to leave was \u201c100%\u201d his choice, Calhoun said in an interview on CNBC Monday morning. But Calhoun has become the focus of many who are critical of the way Boeing has been run in recent decades and the string of safety and quality issues. \u201cHe\u2019s the very best CEO that Airbus has ever had,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory and a leading aerospace analyst, recently referring to the advantages gained by Boeing\u2019s main rival during his tenure running Boeing. His departure also comes in the face of widespread criticism of the company by CEOs of many of the world\u2019s major airlines Boeing depends upon to buy its planes. CEOs of numerous airlines had asked to speak directly to the Boeing board last week, which Calhoun tried to characterize Monday as a normal process, even if it\u2019s rare for customers to speak directly to directors. As to why Calhoun decided to stay on through the end of the year rather than leave immediately, he told CNBC: \u201cWe have another mountain to climb. Let\u2019s not avoid what happened with Alaska Air. Let\u2019s not avoid the call for action. Let\u2019s not avoid the changes that we need to make in our factories.\u201d \u201cWe will get through that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve committed myself to the board to do exactly that.\u201d Airlines\u2019 problems with Boeing The airlines are upset both by the quality of the planes they are getting from Boeing, and the fact that Boeing won\u2019t be able to deliver the planes they were counting on this year, as passenger demand continues to surge to record levels. Michael O\u2019Leary, CEO of Ryanair, Europe\u2019s largest airline and one that flies only Boeing 737 planes, told CNN last week that whenever it takes deliveries of Boeing jets \u201cwe spend 48 hours going through the plane checking it for errors, omissions or anything else.\u201d And O\u2019Leary said while it hasn\u2019t found anything major in those checks, it regularly finds minor problems such as tools under floorboards and missing seat handles, that \u201cshows, I think, a lack of attention to detail quality issues in Boeing.\u201d Ryanair issued a statement Monday saying, \u201cWe welcome these much-needed management changes in Seattle.\u201d United Airlines, which flies Boeing jets for more than 80% of its mainline fleet, has expressed disappointment in quality issues at Boeing and a delay in its scheduled deliveries. The airline is a primary customer for a stretched version of the Boeing 737 Max, known as the Max 10, but Boeing\u2019s inability to get the plane certified to carry passengers is also causing headaches. Scott Kirby, CEO of United, described the Alaska Airlines incident as the \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d for its plans to get the Max 10 this year, as planned, and it is now looking at possibly buying jets from Boeing rival Airbus to take the place of the Max 10s it has ordered. But it is difficult for airlines to shift to Airbus, which has a long backlog of jets it has already committed to build for its existing customer base. Any Boeing customer shifting to Airbus could find itself waiting until 2030 or beyond to get its planes delivered. And operating two types of aircraft of the same class is costly, since pilots are certified to fly specific aircraft, and most cannot shift back and forth between an Airbus and a Boeing without training. And the airline needs to keep a supply of expensive spare parts on hand for every type of aircraft it operates. Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci estimated recently it cost his airline $75 million to $100 million a year to operate both Airbus and Boeing single-aisle jets after it merged with Virgin America, which is why it got rid of its Airbus jets after the merger was complete. And Alaska is a smaller national airline, only America\u2019s fifth largest. Larger airlines face even greater costs from splitting fleets between manufacturers. Facing numerous safety probes The Boeing 737 Max 9 was grounded for three weeks after the Alaska Airlines incident as airlines completed inspections of their own planes\u2019 door plugs. Minicucci disclosed that many of his planes were discovered to have loose bolts, although he did not mention missing bolts. An audit of Boeing procedures by the Federal Aviation Administration in the wake of the Alaska Airlines incident found numerous \u201cnon-compliance issues.\u201d The agency gave the company 90 days to come up with a plan to fix its safety and quality issues. But the probes at Boeing aren\u2019t limited to the FAA audit. A preliminary investigation found that the plane left the Boeing factory in October without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place. While the NTSB has not identified who is at fault for the missing bolts, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy criticized Boeing for not providing the agency with the documentation for who handled the installation of the door plug. Calhoun told investors in January after the incident that \u201cwe caused the problem, and we understand that. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.\u201d And Boeing is also facing an investigation by the Justice Department, which could open it up to criminal liability, and upend a controversial deferred prosecution agreement the company reached in January 2021 to settle charges it defrauded the FAA during the original certification process for the 737 Max last decade. It was days away from having that probation-like period end when the Alaska Air incident happened. The company has also had problems not related to the Max during Calhoun\u2019s time in charge at Boeing, including a couple of halts in deliveries of the 787 Dreamliners, one of its main widebody jets, due to quality issues with that plane. Finance, not engineering background Calhoun, 66, a longtime board member at Boeing, became chairman of the company in late 2019, when the board stripped his predecessor Dennis Muilenburg of that title. He was tapped as CEO after Muilenburg was ousted in December of that year, starting in the job in January 2020. Boeing was once known as a company that put engineering excellence ahead of financial performance, and produced planes that were the gold standard in the industry. Critics of the company say that focus has changed in the last 25 years, citing the 1997 merger with competitor McDonell Douglas for the shift in focus on saving money. Calhoun is one of the executives since that time with no engineering background, having served as senior managing director and head of portfolio operations at investing firm The Blackstone Group, as well as CEO of Nielsen after 26 years at General Electric. Calhoun\u2019s tenure began about halfway through a 20-month grounding of the 737 Max due to a design flaw that was determined to have caused the two crashes; and just before the Covid pandemic broke out globally, causing a near halt in air travel and massive losses for the airlines Boeing depends upon to buy its planes. Asked about what he would like to see in his successor, Calhoun told CNBC Monday that \u201cI want somebody who knows how to handle a big, long, long-cycle business like ours. It\u2019s not just the production of the airplane. It\u2019s the development of the next airplane. It will be a $50 billion investment. I would like somebody who clearly has the experience inside our industry.\u201d Shares of Boeing, which have lost more than 26% of their value since the start of the year, were 4% higher at the market open Monday, but they soon lost most of that gain and closed slightly above 1%.

A door plug blew out on an Alaska Airlines flight leaving a gaping hole in the Boeing 737 Max fuselage. Passengers\u2019 phones and clothing were ripped from their bodies and sent hurtling out into the night as oxygen masks dropped and the plane made its way to the ground, fortunately without any serious injuries. Another Boeing jet plunged so severely that passengers were thrown onto the ceiling of the cabin, leaving dozens so injured they need to be hospitalized upon landing. A passenger plane collided with a military plane at a Tokyo airport, killing five members of the Japanese Coast Guard who were responding to an earthquake. And more minor incidents happened, like when a 200-pound wheel fell off a plane on takeoff, crushing parked vehicles on the ground. Another plane\u2019s engine caught fire. A jet arrived at an airport only to have a missing panel discovered. These incidents all gained attention worthy of a Kardashian on social media. But answering the question of whether it is still safe to fly is not so straightforward. The quick answer is that flying is safe \u2014 safer than most forms of travel \u2014 and far, far safer than the car ride most people take every day without thinking twice. \u201cWhen you arrive at the airport, and step aboard the pressurized tube, that\u2019s the safest part of the trip,\u201d said Anthony Brickhouse, a crash investigator and professor of aviation safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. \u201cYou were more at risk driving to the airport.\u201d But it\u2019s also true that it\u2019s only pure luck that the American aviation industry has kept its near-perfect safety record intact. 15 nearly perfect years Since a regional jet crashed in Buffalo, New York, in January of 2009, killing 49 on board and one on the ground, only five other people have died in accidents on scheduled commercial flights in the United States: By comparison, an average of more than 100 people a day died on America\u2019s roads and highways between 2003 and 2022, the most recent year for which full year traffic deaths are available. That means nearly as many died on roads and highways every hour, on average, as the number of people who died in US commercial aviation crashes in 15 years. However, other forms of flying are not nearly as safe. Nearly 300 people have died since 2009 while traveling in \u201con demand\u201d air service, such as private jets. And nearly 5,500 people have died in general aviation, which are typically small planes often operated by amateur pilots. While commercial aviation has the safest record among transit options, railroads are the second safest form of travel. Railroads had 71 passenger deaths on commuter trains and Amtrak from 2009 through last year. But passenger trains logged far fewer miles traveled than planes or motor vehicles. When you control for the much higher number of miles traveled by planes, it\u2019s clearly much more dangerous to travel on the ground than to fly on a commercial US airline. Ed Pierson, the director of the Foundation for Aviation Safety and a harsh critic of Boeing, said he knows the stats, but because of concerns about quality controls at the embattled aircraft maker, he still would refuse to fly on the Boeing 737 Max or have a family member do so. He has even gotten off a Max just before departure after he was surprised to find out he was on that particular model of plane. Still, Pierson said he is willing to fly on most planes, even many older Boeing models. \u201cTaking the Max out of the equation, (flying has) been proven to be pretty darn safe,\u201d he said. Disaster narrowly averted Unfortunately, the safety record of recent years is not a guarantee of safety in the future. The record for the nearly fatality-free US airplane travel industry is partly due to the efforts of aviation authorities, airlines and aircraft manufacturers, despite the criticism heaped on all three of those groups recently. But mainly it\u2019s been sheer luck. In each case, if things had gone just a little differently, the outcomes could have been much worse. The Alaska Air plane that lost the door plug had flown for more than two months without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. It had made 153 flights before the door plug blew out at 16,000 feet. Twenty-two of those flights were between Hawaii and the mainland. If the door had blown out at the normal 35,000-foot cruising altitude, or hours from the nearest airport over the open Pacific Ocean, or if the plug had gone straight back and hit the tail of the plane and caused damage, it could likely have caused a loss of the aircraft and the 177 people on board. And that\u2019s not the biggest break. A year ago, the discussion about air safety wasn\u2019t focused on Boeing planes. It was on a series of near-misses on runways at the nation\u2019s airports with reports of incident after incident of narrowly averted collisions. Near disasters for planes on the ground On February 4, 2023, a FedEx jet came within 150 feet of the runway before its pilots realized a Southwest jet was in the process of taking off on the same runway. It was one of five such incidents in which an accident was only narrowly avoided in a period of just seven weeks at the start of last year. And none of those were as potentially serious as another incident in July 2017, when an Air Canada jet piloted by a captain who had been awake for more than 19 hours nearly landed on a taxiway at San Francisco International Airport where three wide-body jets filled with passengers were waiting to take off. The NTSB later determined the Air Canada jet got within 100 feet of the ground before it took off again without making contact with any of the passenger planes on the ground. The safety regulator said more than 1,000 people on the four planes might have died had the accident not been averted at the last moment. \u201cIt would have been the worst disaster in aviation history,\u201d Brickhouse said. \u201cPilots, air traffic controllers, mechanics \u2014 they\u2019re all human, and humans make mistakes. We\u2019ve been working toward designing the system so that when mistakes are made, we can recover from them without it being a tragedy.\u201d But Pierson said the system is under unprecedented stress, and regulators, airlines and aircraft manufactures like Boeing need to make changes. \u201cI think the system is under tremendous stress,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a shortage of staff, in air traffic control, a shortage of pilots, of maintenance personnel, of manufacturing personnel.\u201d Plagued by overconfidence? What concerns Pierson the most is the attitude that the apparent safety of the American aviation system means nothing needs to be improved. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of overconfidence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gold standard is melting down, because we continue to try to downplay everything and talk about how safe the system is. That\u2019s not the right mindset. That\u2019s the mindset that gets people killed.\u201d Brickhouse believes the planes now in use are safe. He said the drama of the Alaska Air incident brought attention to a series of other events that in and of themselves don\u2019t pose a serious threat, even if they should not have happened. \u201cWe have safety events in aviation all the time. That is not an indictment of the aviation industry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after Alaska Air, it became a snowballing event and everyone became hypersensitive.\u201d Despite having more confidence in the safety of the system than Pierson, Brickhouse said he also wouldn\u2019t dismiss anyone who\u2019s fearful about flying right now or who wants to avoid a plane like the 737 Max. And he has his own concerns about things like the number of narrowly avoided accidents at the nation\u2019s airports. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in luck, but we are fortunate that these incidents  did not turn into disasters,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have a trend that keeps occurring, you need to focus on fixing it.\u201d", "articleSection": ["business"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Chris Isidore", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/chris-isidore"}], "dateModified": "2024-03-24T16:30:29.676Z", "description": "The reports of harrowing, and sometimes tragic incidents aboard airplanes accelerated this year, leading many to wonder if it\u2019s still safe to fly.", "headline": "Flying is getting scary.

Serious program execution problems and high-profile safety incidents, with still-fresh memories of the two\u00a0737\u00a0MAX disasters\u00a0in\u00a02018 and 2019, are damaging the company\u2019s brand and bringing increased regulatory scrutiny. Its recovery won\u2019t begin until management starts examining how the company got here. Years ago, an excessive focus on financial returns led Boeing to badly neglect two of its greatest resources: its people and its suppliers. First, in the 2010s, Boeing made a forceful effort to weaken its workforce\u2019s power. Aggressive moves, such as transferring production sites to\u00a0new locations\u00a0and\u00a0threatening to move additional work, reduced labor\u2019s negotiating power, resulting in\u00a0minimal pay increases\u00a0and\u00a0terminated pension plans. Most damaging, then-CEO\u00a0Jim McNerney\u00a0systematically promoted non-technical people to executive positions, particularly on the\u00a0board. Incredibly, the\u00a0MAX\u00a0was developed under him and the commercial unit CEO \u2014 neither of whom had a technical degree. Current CEO Dave Calhoun, also\u00a0not an engineer, has followed the same path,\u00a0promoting\u00a0people with similar finance backgrounds. At the same time, the company went after its suppliers\u2019 profits. Programs like\u00a0Partnering For Success called for consistent price reductions, even as demand increased. Boeing pursued its suppliers\u2019\u00a0product support business,\u00a0further impacting their business models.\u00a0Payment terms were increased to 120 days\u00a0in many cases, up from around\u00a030 days. The company announced a\u00a0\u201cno-fly list,\u201d\u00a0implying that suppliers that didn\u2019t give in to Boeing\u2019s demands would not be used for future jets. Boeing even began an ill-advised program of\u00a0vertical integration, aiming to replicate systems and components provided by some of its specialized suppliers, to further pressure them on price. Effectively, workers and suppliers were being crunched to provide rewards to Boeing shareholders. And in the short run, it worked great. In 2012, 19% of operating cash flow was being returned to\u00a0shareholders\u00a0in the form of dividends and buybacks. By 2015, this had ramped up to an astonishing 99%. It stayed in the 90% range until the two MAX crashes and the resulting MAX line shutdown. Between 2014 and 2018, the company rewarded investors with $53 billion in these returns.\u00a0Senior executives, often compensated on the basis of\u00a0stock returns, also did quite well. The result of this strategy is plain to see: an under-resourced supply chain, and an equally under-resourced and badly alienated workforce. These have resulted in\u00a0missed production targets, serious\u00a0program delays,\u00a0failed safety audits and embarrassing instances of\u00a0shoddy workmanship. Regulatory and political scrutiny is increasing and will likely worsen. Boeing\u2019s brand is increasingly tarnished. Airlines are increasingly\u00a0vocal with their anger and frustration, as their fleet plans \u2014 and associated revenue forecasts \u2014 have been confounded by delivery delays. Technical issues, coupled with increased regulatory oversight, have jeopardized certification timing for two new variants of the 737 MAX, the\u00a0737 MAX 7\u00a0and 737\u00a0MAX 10. Airlines like\u00a0Southwest\u00a0and United\u00a0had pegged their fleet plans to these models,\u00a0so the\u00a0delays\u00a0are sure to impact the number of flights they\u2019re able to schedule. And even Boeing\u2019s\u00a0stock price\u00a0has begun to suffer \u2014 ironic for a management team accused of an excessive financial focus. All is not lost. Boeing still has good people, impressive technologies and great jetliners. The latter are\u00a0in a duopoly with very high entry barriers, even if Airbus is quickly gaining market share. All that\u2019s needed is a new approach to management at the top. If there is a new management team, it would be wise for them to learn from history. Treating suppliers and workers as partners would be a great start. Senior executives need to engage directly with them, spending time in factories, talking with the suppliers, engineers and machinists engaged in the company\u2019s core business. Instead of denying the need for any new products \u2014 as\u00a0Calhoun bizarrely did in November 2022\u00a0when he said the company might not introduce any new models until the 2030s\u00a0\u2014 they should be talking about new opportunities that would restore the company to industry leadership. A lot of this comes down to just showing up. The current approach of staying in office buildings and focusing on financial abstractions clearly isn\u2019t working.", "articleSection": ["opinions"], "author": [], "dateModified": "2024-03-22T17:08:00.920Z", "description": "An excessive focus on financial returns led Boeing to badly neglect two of its greatest resources: its people and its suppliers, writes Richard Aboulafia.", "headline": "Opinion: How Boeing lost its way", "image": [{"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1967452836.jpg?c=original", "caption": "The headquarters for The Boeing Company is seen on January 31, 2024 in Arlington, Virginia.", "sourceOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Getty Images"}, "width": "4500", "height": "3001", "creditText": "Samuel Corum/Getty Images", "dateCreated": "2024-01-31T05:00:00.000Z"}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/richard-aboulafia.jpg?c=original", "caption": "Richard Aboulafia", "sourceOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "MarcGregor Campredon"}, "width": "3000", "height": "2000", "creditText": "MarcGregor Campredon", "dateCreated": "2023-12-13T05:00:00.000Z"}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240130161221-ntsb-investigation-alaska-airlines-boeing-737-9-max-0107.jpg?c=original", "caption": "NTSB Investigator-in-Charge John Lovell examines the fuselage plug area of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 Boeing 737-9 MAX on January 7 in Portland, Oregon.", "sourceOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Getty Images"}, "width": "2000", "height": "1333", "creditText": "Handout/NTSB/Getty Images", "dateCreated": "2024-01-07T00:00:00.000Z"}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1967452836.jpg?c=original", "caption": "The headquarters for The Boeing Company in Arlington, Virginia.", "sourceOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Getty Images"}, "width": "4500", "height": "3001", "creditText": "Samuel Corum/Getty Images", "dateCreated": "2024-01-31T05:00:00.000Z"}], "thumbnailUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1967452836.jpg?c=original", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@context": "https://schema.org", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/22/opinions/boeing-safety-suppliers-employees-aboulafia/index.html", "dateModified": "2024-03-22T17:08:00.920Z", "inLanguage": "en", "additionalType": "article_leaf", "publisher": {"@type": "NewsMediaOrganization", "name": "CNN", "logo": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61", "foundingDate": "1980-06-01", "url": "https://www.cnn.com", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/cnn/", "https://twitter.com/CNN", "https://www.instagram.com/cnn/", "https://www.youtube.com/cnn"]}, "name": "Opinion: How Boeing lost its way", "headline": "Opinion: How Boeing lost its way", "description": "An excessive focus on financial returns led Boeing to badly neglect two of its greatest resources: its people and its suppliers, writes Richard Aboulafia.", "datePublished": "2024-03-22T16:54:49.017Z"}, "publisher": {"@type": "NewsMediaOrganization", "name": "CNN", "logo": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61", "foundingDate": "1980-06-01", "url": "https://www.cnn.com", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/cnn/", "https://twitter.com/CNN", "https://www.instagram.com/cnn/", "https://www.youtube.com/cnn"]}, "timeRequired": "P0Y0M0DT0H3M5S", "wordCount": 696, "datePublished": "2024-03-22T16:54:49.017Z", "isAccessibleForFree": false, "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": false, "cssSelector": ".article__content"}}, {"@type": "NewsArticle", "@context": "https://schema.org", "articleBody": "Passengers on board the Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 that suffered a terrifying midair blowout in January have received a letter from the FBI saying they may be victims \u201cof a crime.\u201d Attorney Mark Lindquist, who represents multiple passengers that were on Alaska Airlines flight 1282, shared with CNN the letter that the FBI office in Seattle sent to passengers on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m contacting you because we have identified you as a possible victim of a crime,\u201d the letter reads in part. It also notes that the FBI is currently investigating the case. \u201cMy clients and I welcome the DOJ investigation,\u201d Lindquist told CNN, \u201cWe want accountability. We want answers. We want safer Boeing planes. And a DOJ investigation helps advance our goals.\u201d Attorney Robert Clifford, who represents many family members of the 2019 crash victims of a Boeing 737 Max jet flown by Ethiopian Air as well as some of the recent Alaska Air passengers, said some of his clients on Alaska Air also got the letter notifying them that they could be crime victims. \u201cI\u2019m certain everyone on the plane will be getting this letter,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe families of the Ethiopian Air victims should have also been considered crime victims.\u201d In addition to the letters that went out to passengers, flight attendants aboard Alaska Air Flight 1282 have been interviewed by investigators from the Justice Department, according to people familiar with the situation. The letters were first reported by the Wall Street Journal earlier this month. \u201cThe FBI does not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation,\u201d FBI Seattle\u2019s Public Affairs Office wrote in an email to CNN, citing Department of Justice policy. Boeing\u2019s potential criminal liability But Justice opened a probe into the incident and Boeing in February,\u00a0CNN has previously reported. That investigation carries the potential to upend a controversial deferred prosecution agreement that Boeing reached with the Justice Department in the final month of the Trump administration. Tha settlement, which was criticized by families of crash victims and members of Congress, was over charges that Boeing defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the original certification process for the 737 Max jets. Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion as part of that settlement, but most of that was money Boeing had already agreed to pay to the airlines that had purchased the Max jets grounded for 20 months following the Ethiopian Air crash and an earlier crash in Indonesia. The deferred prosecution agreement could have ended the threat of Boeing facing criminal liability for those earlier fraud charges. But the Alaska Air incident came just days before a three-year probation-like period was due to end, so the criminal probe could expose Boeing to charges not just for the Alaska Air incident but also the earlier allegations of criminal wrongdoing. Boeing declined to comment. On January 5, 171 passengers and six crew members boarded the flight in Portland, Oregon, bound for Ontario, California. Abruptly after take off, a panel of the fuselage called the \u201cdoor plug\u201d blew off, forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing. A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the jet, which was delivered to Alaska by Boeing in October, had left Boeing\u2019s factory without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place. While the NTSB has yet to assess blame for the missing bolts, it has criticized Boeing for not having the documentation available showing who worked on the door plug when the plane was at Boeing\u2019s factory. The FAA has also found multiple problems with production practices of both Boeing and its major supplier Spirit AeroSystems following a six-week audit of Boeing triggered by the January 5 door plug blowout. Subpoenas from the Justice Department were also recently sent seeking documents and information that may be related to Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems and mentions the \u201cdoor plug\u201d that is used in the Boeing 737 Max 9s, according to a\u00a0report from Bloomberg. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told investors last month that \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.\u201d The development comes the same week Boeing said it will report massive losses in the first quarter stemming from the Alaska Airlines incident. The losses will be in part because of compensation to airlines that owned the Max 9, which was\u00a0grounded for three weeks\u00a0after the incident. Alaska Air CEO Ben Minicucci told investors last month that the incident cost his\u00a0airline about $150 million, and that it expected to be compensated for those losses by Boeing. The other contributors to losses will be \u201call the things we\u2019re doing around the factory,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brian West said on Wednesday, leading to slower production at its 737 Max plant in Renton Washington.", "articleSection": ["business"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Sara Smart", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/sara-smart"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Chris Isidore", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/chris-isidore"}], "dateModified": "2024-03-22T11:35:40.886Z", "description": "Passengers on board the Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 that suffered a terrifying midair blowout in January have received a letter from the FBI saying they may be victims \u201cof a crime.\u201d", "headline": "FBI tells Alaska Airlines passengers they may be \u2018victim of a crime\u2019", "image": [{"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1910141194.jpg?c=original", "caption": "In this National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) handout, plastic covers the exterior of the fuselage plug area of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 Boeing 737-9 MAX on January 7, 2024 in Portland, Oregon.

On Wednesday, Ryanair (RYAAY) CEO Michael O\u2019Leary explained why prices have further to climb. \u201cIf you have constrained supply (and) strong demand, I think it\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019re going to see air fares bump again this summer\u2026 between 5 and 10%,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Richard Quest. Europe\u2019s biggest airline by passengers had expected to receive 57 Boeing planes this summer, but now anticipates getting between 35 and 40, according to O\u2019Leary. Ryanair is far from the only major carrier with too few aircraft. Southwest in the United States, which flies only Boeing 737 planes, announced last week that Boeing would deliver 40% fewer jets than it had been expecting this year. A critical shortage of planes is also plaguing other airlines \u2014 and the problem is not confined to Boeing. According to aviation analytics firm Cirium, about 600 Airbus jets globally have been grounded for at least the last month due to an issue with engines made by US aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney. That\u2019s hurting Lufthansa, the German group that also owns carriers in Austria and Switzerland. CEO Carsten Spohr told CNN Wednesday that it has more than 30 Airbus A320Neos currently grounded. \u201cThis industry \u2026 suffers from this lack of airplanes,\u201d he added, noting that the shortage was affecting the company\u2019s ability to grow. The grounding of some planes and delayed deliveries of new aircraft will mean that fares in the United States \u201cshould stay elevated through 2024, instead of tapering\u2026 as occurred last year after May,\u201d according to Robert Mann, founder of\u00a0R.W. Mann & Company, an airline industry consulting firm in the United States. Mann cited data from Airlines Reporting Corporation, which tracks ticket sales worldwide, showing that fares on US domestic flights booked in February for travel this year were 5%-6% higher than the same month last year, far outpacing overall inflation. Airbus output still below 2019 The supply constraints helping to keep air fares higher may be around for some time yet. There\u2019s a near-duopoly between Boeing and Airbus in commercial aircraft manufacturing, meaning airlines have almost no option but to wait in line. According to ADS, the United Kingdom\u2019s aerospace industry association, the global order backlog for commercial aircraft has now topped 15,700. Last year, airlines globally placed 3,850 commercial aircraft orders, the highest number since ADS started publishing the data in 2010 and a 91% increase on 2022. By comparison, planemakers delivered 1,265 aircraft, just 11% up on the previous year. Boeing said this week that it had slowed production of its 737 Max jets after a part of the fuselage of a Max 9 blew out mid-flight in early January, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Aviation regulators have yet to certify Boeing\u2019s Max 10 as safe for passengers \u2014 a plane crucial to the growth of carriers such as Ryanair, which inked a $40 billion deal last year to buy up to 300 of the aircraft. United Airlines, for its part, is not waiting around for Max 10s. The US carrier has asked Boeing to stop building it Max 10s and build Max 9s instead, and is also looking at plugging the gaps with Airbus planes, provided it makes financial sense. \u201cIf we get a deal that the economics work, we\u2019ll do something (with Airbus),\u201d CEO Scott Kirby said at a JPMorgan conference last week. But \u2014 as Kirby well knows \u2014 it\u2019s not that easy to switch planemakers. Aircraft orders are placed years in advance and pilots are trained to fly certain planes. Airbus, meanwhile, had an order backlog approaching 8,600 commercial aircraft at the end of last year and is already booked up until 2030. The European planemaker is also a lot less productive than it used to be as pandemic supply chain kinks linger. \u201cAt Airbus, we are still producing far less planes than we were producing in 2019,\u201d CEO Guillame Faury said at the \u201cEurope 2024\u201d conference in Berlin this week. According to Johan Lundgren, the CEO of EasyJet, the low-cost UK carrier is \u201cprobably the only airline in Europe\u201d getting all its aircraft orders from Airbus on time this year. The industry will likely be constrained for the next three years, he told CNN. Soaring demand Even before Boeing\u2019s troubles turned the industry on its head, airlines were ill-prepared for the spectacular comeback in air travel that followed the pandemic. Many had slashed the size of their fleets and laid off thousands of employees just to stay afloat as Covid-19 lockdowns throttled air travel. Airlines are now scrambling to respond to resurgent demand, as Boeing\u2019s crisis collides with supply chain problems. A global boom in defense spending is complicating matters further, since about 40% of the supply chain serves both aerospace and defense companies, according to Craven at ADS. The question now, says Richard Aboulafia, a longtime aviation consultant, is how quickly Airbus can ramp up and go from \u201chalf the market to two-thirds and beyond.\u201d \u201cThis is an industry with only two suppliers, very high barriers to entry and (an) extremely strong comeback with a very tight labor market,\u201d he told CNN. Some 4.7 billion people are expected to travel by plane this year, an historic high that exceeds the 4.5 billion recorded in 2019, according to the International Air Transport Association, an industry group. \u201cCapacity is going to be tight and that leads to higher ticket prices,\u201d said Aboulafia, who is managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \u201cWhat you\u2019ll probably see is (that) the reduction in high fares we were hoping to see doesn\u2019t happen. You\u2019ll probably see a reversal\u2026 across the board and centered in the Atlantic.\u201d Richard Quest and Maisie Linford contributed reporting.

In an update of its probe released Wednesday ahead of the crash anniversary, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) did not address the crucial question of what had prompted\u00a0China Eastern flight 5735\u00a0to nosedive, nor did it mention data from the plane\u2019s black boxes that would offer key clues to explain what happened. Instead, its statement merely reiterated earlier findings that it found no problems with\u00a0the aircraft,\u00a0crew or weather conditions before the flight departed the southwestern city of Kunming for Guangzhou on March 21, 2022. The update failed to quell speculation in China about what caused the fatal crash, with some asking why investigators had not disclosed information from the black boxes. Black boxes\u00a0record all relevant\u00a0flight\u00a0data, as well as conversations in the cockpit, which are used by investigators to reconstruct the events leading to an aircraft incident. In a summary of its preliminary report released in April 2022, the CAAC said the two black boxes of the crashed China Eastern jet were \u201cseverely damaged\u201d and \u201cthe data restoration and analysis work is still in progress.\u201d But sophisticated laboratories like those run by the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and its counterparts in France, Australia and the United Kingdom, can reconstruct even broken memory cards and then line up the data with audio feeds into the cockpit voice recorder. The Wall Street Journal reported in May 2022 that black box data recovered from the flight\u00a0and sent to the US NTSB for analysis suggests someone in the cockpit intentionally downed the plane, citing a preliminary assessment from United States officials. \u201cThe plane did what it was told to do by someone in the cockpit,\u201d the Journal quoted a person who is familiar with American officials\u2019 preliminary assessment as saying. The CAAC has previously denied the crash was caused intentionally. \u201cThese rumors\u2026have seriously misled the public and interfered with the investigation of the accident,\u201d Wu Shijie, a CAAC official, told a news conference in April 2022. In its update Wednesday, the CAAC said no faults or abnormalities were found in the aircraft\u2019s systems, structures or engines before take-off. The flight and cabin crew held valid licenses, and the crew had enough rest and passed health checks on the day of the flight;\u00a0the support staff and facilities at the departure airport were fine, so were air control personnel and communication, navigation and monitoring systems, it said. Before the crash, there were no abnormalities in radio communications and control commands, or any reports of dangerous weather in the airspace of the plane or along its route, according to the CAAC. There was also no evidence to suggest the plane was carrying dangerous items in cargo or passengers\u2019 luggage, it added. \u201cIn the follow-up, the technical investigation team will continue to carry out experimental verification and cause analysis, and release relevant information in a timely manner based on the progress of the investigation,\u201d the statement said, suggesting the investigation will continue into a third year. The statement was met with strong criticism on Chinese social media. \u201cIf everything is normal, it means that it is either done intentionally by someone on board, or caused by sudden force majeure!\u201d said a top comment on social platform Weibo with nearly 28,000 upvotes.

That would be the biggest loss margin at the Boeing unit in two years, since the company had been forced to halt deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner because of other quality issues at that time. This time, the 737 Max production has been slowed because of the door plug that blew off of a 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Air flight soon after takeoff, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet. Shares of Boeing, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, were down about 2% in premarket trading on the guidance. The losses will be in part because of compensation to airlines that owned the Max 9, which was grounded for three weeks after the incident. Alaska Air CEO Ben Minicucci told investors last month that the incident cost his airline about $150 million, and that it expected to be compensated for those losses by Boeing. The other contributors to losses will be \u201call the things we\u2019re doing around the factory,\u201d West said, leading to slower production at its 737 Max plant in Renton Washington. \u201cThere are changes that need to happen. There\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe\u2019re deliberately going slow to get this right. For years, we prioritized the movement of the airplane through the factory over getting it done right, and that\u2019s got to change.\u201d West said that Boeing would slow production of the Max below the 38 per month it was building at the end of 2023. It had originally planned to increase production this year, but those plans to increase output were halted by the Federal Aviation Administration as it conducts an audit of Boeing\u2019s operations. It has given Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to fix quality and safety issues for its commercial planes. West described the audit, which has found wide ranging problems with quality controls at Boeing factories, as \u201ca tougher audit than anything we\u2019ve been through before.\u201d He said profit margins in the commercial airplane unit, the largest at Boeing, would be negative through the rest of this year, although they will \u201cget better through the year.\u201d \u201cBut if we run the business for the long term, we believe that those margins are going to get to historical levels in the \u201925-\u201826 timeframe.\u201d The company\u2019s commercial plane unit had a 14% operating profit margin for 2018, its most recent profitable year. Higher production rates in the future will allow that return to profitability, according to West, along with the shutdown of what Boeing calls \u201cshadow factories\u201d where planes that come off the assembly line are held back from being delivered to customers for additional work that needs to be done on them. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that needs to happen between now and then,\u201d he said. The company reported a $41 million operating profit for its commercial aircraft unit in the fourth quarter, giving it a 0.4% profit margin, the first positive margin at the unit in nearly five years. It faced a 20-month grounding of the 737 Max that started in 2019 following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people that was attributed to a design flaw with the planes. Since the start of that grounding, Boeing has reported total operating losses of $31.5 billion through the end of last year. While a 20% loss margin is bad, Boeing has seen worse recently, with the loss margin from its commercial airplane unit soaring to 169% in the second quarter of 2020, as it dealt with both the Max grounding and the start of the pandemic. The pandemic caused airlines globally to essentially stop taking deliveries of new jets due to massive losses caused by a near halt in air travel.", "articleSection": ["business"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Chris Isidore", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/chris-isidore"}], "dateModified": "2024-03-20T12:18:49.306Z", "description": "Boeing will report a massive loss in the first quarter stemming from the Alaska Airlines door plug blowout on January 5, Chief Financial Officer Brian West said at an investor conference Wednesday.", "headline": "Boeing forecasts big losses after the Alaska Airlines incident", "image": [{"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240130161221-ntsb-investigation-alaska-airlines-boeing-737-9-max-0107.jpg?c=original", "caption": "In this National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) handout, NTSB Investigator-in-Charge John Lovell examines the fuselage plug area of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 Boeing 737-9 MAX on January 7, 2024 in Portland, Oregon.

That\u2019s the message from Jan Hatzius, the chief economist of Goldman Sachs. \u201cCertainly, it doesn\u2019t look like the economy is anywhere close to a recession,\u201d Hatzius told CNN. Even though he concedes inflation has come in hotter-than-expected so far this year, the Goldman economist is sticking by his prescient call for a soft landing. \u201cIf I look at the news flow overall over the last year, it\u2019s still very, very positive,\u201d Hatzius said. \u201cInflation has come down very substantially over that period. And more importantly, it\u2019s come down without significant weakness in activity. We haven\u2019t seen a recession. We haven\u2019t been close to a recession.\u201d To fight inflation, the Federal Reserve spiked interest rates in 2022 and 2023 at the fastest pace since the 1980s under legendary Fed chief Paul Volcker. Many feared that war on inflation would cause unemployment to surge and short-circuit the economic recovery from Covid-19. At one point in the fall of 2022, a model by Bloomberg projected a 100% risk of a US recession over the following 12 months. Now, many economists are in the soft landing camp as consumer spending and the jobs market have proven to be much more resilient than anticipated. Hatzius told CNN he\u2019s \u201cpretty confident\u201d there won\u2019t be a US recession over the next 12 months, placing just a 15% risk of a downturn. That\u2019s more or less the average recession risk on any given year. That upbeat forecast should be a relief to those in the White House trying to sell voters on President Joe Biden\u2019s economic message. A recession could doom that effort. Since 1900, all five president running for reelection who had a recession in the year they ran for reelection lost, according to TD Cowen Washington Research Group. (Those five presidents were William Howard Taft, Herbert Hoover, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and Donald Trump.) What could accelerate rate cuts Hatzius told CNN that inflation will likely have cooled enough by June to pave the way for the Fed to start cutting interest rates. That would help ease high borrowing costs on everything from mortgages and car loans to credit cards. \u201cOur forecast and current market expectation is that the first cut comes in June, but it\u2019s going to be data dependent,\u201d Hatzius said. The Fed could speed up interest rate cuts if the historically-strong jobs market starts to weaken. \u201cIf we were to see more pervasive signs of labor market deterioration, I\u2019d say it becomes more urgent to move,\u201d Hatzius said. Even as hiring has remained sturdy, the unemployment rate climbed to 3.9% in February, up from the historic low of 3.5% as recently as July 2023. Hatzius said that if the unemployment rate moves into the low-4% range, that would make officials inside the Fed nervous enough to start pulling forward their rate cut plans. Unknown unknowns Even though recession risks have eased, there are always wildcards that could change the picture quickly. \u201cAlmost by definition, I think shocks are negative. Now what am I worried about? Geopolitics would certainly be high up on the list,\u201d Hatzius said. \u201cWe live in a much more unstable world with military conflict, the war in Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, more tensions between the US and China.\u201d And then there are the unknown unknowns, as Donald Rumsfeld famously phrased. \u201cThe shock that occurred four years ago was kind of the most extreme version of an unknown, unknown that we have seen in many decades, if not ever,\u201d Hatzius said, referring to Covid. Empty office buildings One risk that is casting a shadow over the economy is empty office buildings in the $20 trillion commercial real estate market \u2014 a problem caused in part by Covid and the rise of remote work. Yet Hatzius, like Fed Chair Jerome Powell, doesn\u2019t think empty office buildings will sink the US economy the way toxic mortgages did in 2008. He pointed to the fact that office construction is a relatively small part of the economy and the fact that this problem is expected to play out over several years. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how that would cause a recession,\u201d Hatzius said.", "articleSection": ["business"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Matt Egan", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/matt-egan"}], "dateModified": "2024-03-20T11:00:31.550Z", "description": "The soft landing that once looked nearly impossible for the Federal Reserve to pull off is still on track.

Larger wind turbines produce more power than standard ones, but the components are too big to be transported by road. What\u2019s the solution? A Colorado-based energy startup named Radia has an idea. It\u2019s developing the biggest aircraft in aviation history. Meet the WindRunner airplane, whose mission will be to deliver gigantic 300-foot-long blades directly to wind farms. To help the world meet its decarbonization targets, it\u2019ll use sustainable aviation fuel and needs only a simple packed-dirt or gravel runway to land on. It\u2019ll operate from regional hubs, says Radia, delivering where needed \u2013 and \u201ccan land on airstrips as short as 6,000 feet (1,800 meters), something no other large commercial aircraft can achieve.\u201d Let\u2019s talk about specs, baby When it comes to carrying the largest payloads ever moved by air, dainty just isn\u2019t going to cut it. So WindRunner will have a cargo bay volume of 272,000 cubic feet, enough to hold three Olympic swimming pools. That\u2019s 12 times the volume of a Boeing 747-400 and \u2013 at 356 feet in length, it\u2019s 127 feet longer too. As for the wingspan, that\u2019s 261 feet \u2013 imagine four bowling lanes laid end to end. It will also dwarf the Antonov An-225, the heaviest aircraft ever built, which was destroyed at the start of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The aircraft\u2019s scale might be groundbreaking, but the engineering is not \u2013 and that\u2019s by design. Radia says it\u2019s focusing \u201con existing technology and safety by using, where applicable, tried-and-true aviation materials, components and fabrication techniques that have FAA [US Federal Aviation Administration] approval, are already in mass production and are lowest-risk.\u201d The idea is to hit the ground running with a fast, well-built fleet that meets aerospace industry standards. Online reports say commercial operations as soon as 2027, but there\u2019s no timeline confirmed on Radia\u2019s website. CNN has reached out to the company for comment. There she blows Radia is banking on research organisation Bloomberg NEF\u2019s estimation that up to $10 trillion will be spent on onshore wind through 2050. The development of WindRunner is to enable GigaWind, the XXL turbines made by Radia\u2019s partners, which include five of the world\u2019s top six turbine manufacturers. Currently, turbine blades today are ordinarily 230 feet or less (70 meters), but Radia wants to deploy blades of up to 104 meters (341 feet). The company says GigaWind turbines could potentially be two to three times more powerful \u2013 and two to three times more profitable than those typically deployed today. So who are the folks behind these ambitious claims? The founder and CEO is Mark Lundstrum, a cross-industry entrepreneur and MIT aerospace engineer who founded Radia in 2016. The company says its team of advisers include former top brass from Boeing, MIT, Rolls-Royce and the FAA, as well as former US Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz and former Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull. It\u2019s an impressive lineup and the decision to focus on safe, existing technology is a smart one. Might we see a WindRunner take off before the end of the decade? Could its distinctive shape one day be as popular as the Beluga XL transporter planes created by Airbus?

It was the XB-70 Valkyrie, an experimental plane developed for the US Air Force. Its inaugural flight \u2014 60 years ago in September 1964 \u2014 kicked off a golden era for supersonic aircraft. The plane would later achieve a speed of just over 2,000 miles per hour, nearly 50% faster than Concorde. \u201cThe overall design of the XB-70 was a thing of beauty,\u201d says Tony Landis, a historian at the Air Force Materiel Command in Dayton, Ohio. \u201cTo think such an attractive aircraft, with its speed and altitude capabilities, was built over 65 years ago is hard to comprehend in today\u2019s AI and computer-based engineering environment.\u201d The XB-70 program was not without problems: As a military plane, it was obsolete before it was even rolled out, and its short lifespan was marred by a tragic accident. Even regular flights had everyone on edge, as the aircraft\u2019s components were all pushed to the limits. However, its design has made it an icon of supersonic flight: \u201cTo this day, people stop and stare at the Valkyrie parked majestically at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, admiring its size and shape,\u201d Landis says. \u201cMost people ask if this is a new design, as they\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d Dead on arrival The plane was born out of a competition between Boeing and North American Aviation, then a major aerospace manufacturer that was eventually chosen by the Air Force, in 1957, to develop a bomber capable of carrying nuclear weapons at Mach 2 and 60,000 feet of altitude. However, the downing of an American U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union in 1960 caused a shift from manned bombers to ballistic missiles, and in 1961 President Kennedy billed the upcoming XB-70 as having little chance of penetrating enemy defenses successfully. As a result, just as North American was starting to build the aircraft, the goal of the program shifted to high-speed flight research. The first XB-70 \u2014 nicknamed Valkyrie following a naming contest \u2014 was rolled out in Palmdale, California, on May 11, 1964. With a wingspan of over 100 feet, six General Electric turbojet engines at the back, and 185 feet long, it was easily one of the most impressive planes ever built. Among its distinctive features were wingtips that remained horizontal at subsonic speeds, but folded down once supersonic to reduce drag. Its main design elements, like the delta-shaped wings and the thin, long fuselage were replicated by both Concorde and its Soviet clone, the Tupolev Tu-144, which even sported two \u201ccanards\u201d or winglets right behind the cockpit \u2014 just like the XB-70 \u2014 giving pilots more control at low speeds. \u201cThroughout the 1960s, both the military and civil sector put vast amounts of resources into developing a supersonic transport,\u201d says Landis. \u201cIn the early stages, nearly every aircraft company based its initial design around the XB-70.\u201d As more information became available, Landis adds, these designs morphed into more refined designs like Concorde, as well as other projects that remained on paper, such as the planned Concorde rivals imagined by Lockheed and Boeing. Fake windows Once it was clear that the Valkyrie\u2019s role as a bomber was set aside, its designers came up with alternative uses for the plane: \u201cNorth American engineers became very creative, with many different uses for the aircraft,\u201d says Landis, \u201cBut the only variant to be given serious consideration was the transport version for military and civilian use.\u201d Three variations were proposed, ranging from a high-density one with capacity for 158 passengers, to a \u201cdeluxe\u201d arrangement that allowed for 114 seats and included a lounge area in the center of the passenger compartment. \u201cWhile the first XB-70 was back at Palmdale for inspections and upgrades, North American took the opportunity to add fake window markings to one side of the aircraft to assist in the marketing of the transport variant. The windows were removed prior to the aircraft\u2019s return to flight testing,\u201d Landis says. It\u2019s hard to imagine what the passenger experience could have been like on such a plane, but according to Landis it would have been a lot like Concorde: \u201cSmooth, quiet, with ample space between the seats. Due to the expense in operating the aircraft and limited seating, the cost would most likely be affordable only to the upper middle class and the wealthy.\u201d Most importantly, it would have been fast, connecting London and New York in just two and a half hours, compared to Concorde\u2019s typical three and a half. Other proposed versions of the plane imagined it as a launch platform for orbital spacecraft and even Minuteman missiles \u2013 but just like the passenger version, these never materialized. A fatal crash The XB-70 program was further cut short by a fatal accident that occurred in 1966, during a photoshoot organized by General Electric. The second, and more advanced, of the two existing Valkyries collided in midair with a smaller plane, an F-104N, killing its pilot as well as one of the XB-70\u2019s own pilots, with the other surviving with serious injuries. The destroyed Valkyrie had logged just 46 flights, and the remaining one ended its career after 83 flights \u2014 many of which with NASA as a supersonic testbed \u2014 and just over 160 hours in the air. The very last of those flights occurred on February 4, 1969, to ferry the plane from what is now NASA\u2019s Armstrong Flight Research Center in California to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, where the aircraft joined the collection of the Air Force Museum. While the program may not have lived up to its full potential, the XB-70\u2019s legacy still stands, Landis says: \u201cAll large, high-speed aircraft designs benefit from the work done by the XB-70. And the data from those research flights continues to affect the design of future aircraft.\u201d", "articleSection": ["travel"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Jacopo Prisco", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/jacopo-prisco"}], "dateModified": "2024-03-18T12:28:25.967Z", "description": "Five years before Concorde\u2019s first flight, another majestic supersonic aircraft took to the skies \u2014 and almost became the inspiration for an even faster passenger plane.", "headline": "The supersonic plane that was faster than Concorde", "image": [{"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/709611-20240315205356221.jpg?c=original", "caption": "This photo shows the XB-70A parked on a ramp at Edwards Air Force Base in 1967. Originally designed as a Mach 3 bomber, the XB-70A never went into production and instead was used for flight research involving the Air Force and NASA's Flight Research Center (FRC), which was a predecessor of today's NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. The aircraft's shadow indicates its unusual planform. This featured two canards behind the cockpit, followed by a large, triangular delta wing. The outboard portions of the wing were hinged so they could be folded down for improved high-speed stability. The XB-70 was the world's largest experimental aircraft. It was capable of flight at speeds of three times the speed of sound (roughly 2,000 miles per hour) at altitudes of 70,000 feet. It was used to collect in-flight information for use in the design of future supersonic aircraft, military and civilian. The major objectives of the XB-70 flight research program were to study the airplane's stability and handling characteristics, to evaluate its response to atmospheric turbulence, and to determine the aerodynamic and propulsion performance. In addition there were secondary objectives to measure the noise and friction associated with airflow over the airplane and to determine the levels and extent of the engine noise during takeoff, landing, and ground operations. The XB-70 was about 186 feet long, 33 feet high, with a wingspan of 105 feet. Originally conceived as an advanced bomber for the United States Air Force, the XB-70 was limited to production of two aircraft when it was decided to limit the aircraft's mission to flight research. The first flight of the XB-70 was made on Sept. 21, 1964. The number two XB-70 was destroyed in a mid-air collision on June 8, 1966.

The data, which totals more than a thousand parameters, is swiftly saved electronically into the flight data recorder (FDR), one of the so-called black boxes that aviation safety investigators say offers critical facts when piecing together an incident, like the mid-air plunge on LATAM Airlines flight 800 earlier this week that injured 50 people. The FDR and cockpit voice recorder from the LATAM flight should provide evidence to prove or refute the pilot\u2019s initial explanation, as relayed by a passenger who spoke to CNN: that cockpit displays briefly went blank and the pilot lost control of the plane.\u00a0It could also show whether the yoke was pushed forward, sending the plane rapidly downward \u2014 a scenario The Wall Street Journal reported the investigators are probing, and which may have involved a flight attendant hitting a switch while serving pilots a meal. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no way this will be a mystery,\u201d said Peter Goelz, who led investigations as managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board, and is now a CNN aviation analyst. \u201cThe recorder will indicate if something was starting and what happened.\u201d Regardless of what the FDR shows, the contents of the orange steel box with reflective tape typically mounted in the rear of the plane, which is meant to reduce the risk of damage in a crash, have proven pivotal in past airplane investigations. Used in past investigations In 2015, investigators used the FDR to conclude that a pilot of Germanwings flight 9525 deliberately slammed the airliner into a mountain and ruled out potential airplane malfunctions.\u00a0The FDR recorded 600 parameters onto a modern memory card and investigators extracted the data despite its exposure to extreme temperatures in the crash. Sophisticated laboratories like those run by the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and its counterparts in France, Australia and the United Kingdom, can reconstruct even broken memory cards and then line up the data with audio feeds into the cockpit voice recorder.\u00a0The bright orange color of the container that houses the recorder, a well as locator beacons, help searchers locate the recorders. The devices found underwater are typically transported to the lab inside water before being carefully dried, Goelz said. The 787 Dreamliner \u2014 one of Boeing\u2019s more recently developed aircraft \u2014 feeds data into the flight data recorder through a system called the Common Data Network, which some compare to the human body\u2019s central nervous system.\u00a0It first flew in 2009 and uses new-at-the-time data transfer technologies. US regulations specify about 90 parameters that must be fed into the black box.\u00a0The list includes the thrust for each engine, temperature, flap settings, and the plane\u2019s direction.\u00a0International Civil Aviation Organization standards further specify how often and detailed the data must be.\u00a0Altitude, for example, is recorded four times per second and accurate to the half-degree. The data now encompasses \u201cevery parameter you can imagine \u2014 like notes on a musical score,\u201d said Kathleen Bangs, a spokeswoman for the aviation tracking site FlightAware, and a former pilot.\u00a0\u201cWhen they take all that data and lay it all together, and put this musical score together, that\u2019s when you get really get the full picture.\u201d But the black boxes are not the only tools investigators will have.\u00a0Many components of modern planes, such as the engines, also contain computer chips that track detailed data. Other evidence tools Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is equipment on aircraft that transmits real-time data including the airplane\u2019s position.\u00a0The Federal Aviation Administration used this data after ungrounding Boeing\u2019s 737 Max in late 2020 to track every Max flight. Data is also sent to airlines using the Aircraft Communications, Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), which transmits automated and manually entered messages between airlines and airplanes using radio waves and satellite links. Some aircraft also carry a Quick Access Recorder (QAR) that is not hardened like the FDR but tracks the same data. The QAR can be easily hooked up to a laptop and allow airline employees to download plane performance information for analysis. But it wasn\u2019t always this way. When United Airlines flight 585 crashed shortly before landing in March 1991, the FDR held five data points:\u00a0direction, speed, altitude, G-force, and whether the radio microphone was keyed to transmit. When US Air flight 427 crashed three years later near Pittsburgh, the FDR recorded 11 parameters. \u201cIf these airplanes had been equipped with FDRs with additional parameters, that information would have undoubtedly allowed quick identification of critical control surface movements and their sources and other airplane system conditions that could have been involved in the loss of airplane control,\u201d the NTSB said in a 1999 report referencing those two crashes. \u201cThus, investigators would have been able to more quickly rule out certain factors, when warranted, and focus on other areas.\u201d The NTSB recommended regulators increase the requirements, which ultimately took effect in the early 2000s.

But asked directly whether President Joe Biden thinks it\u2019s safe to fly, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre sidestepped. \u201cI think what he \u2013 I think what Americans should know is that (the Federal Aviation Administration) is doing everything that it can to make sure that Americans feel safe,\u201d Jean-Pierre told reporters during a press briefing Friday. She added that the FAA is taking actions \u201cto make sure that there is increased safety oversight of Boeing and that\u2019s what the American people should feel reassured by.\u201d Her comments came after several scary incidents involving planes manufactured by Boeing, including the terrifying plunge earlier this week involving a Latam Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner flight from Australia to New Zealand. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that a flight attendant may have inadvertently hit a switch on the pilot\u2019s seat while serving a meal, pushing the pilot into controls that altered the plane\u2019s flight, injuring dozens of passengers. CNN has yet to be able to confirm the Journal\u2019s report. \u201cThe investigation of Flight LA800 is ongoing and we defer to the investigation authorities on any potential findings,\u201d Boeing said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cWe have taken the precautionary measure of reminding 787 operators of a service bulletin issued in 2017 which included instructions for inspecting and maintaining switches on flight deck seats.\u201d And in January, a door plug blew out on a Boeing-manufactured Alaskan Airlines flight, leaving a gaping hole in the plane\u2019s fuselage. That incident resulted in a temporary nationwide grounding of certain 737 Max jets, followed by congressional hearings, production and delivery delays, multiple federal investigations \u2014 including a criminal probe \u2014 and a stock that has lost a quarter of its value this year, shaving more than $40 billion off the company\u2019s market valuation. The plug incident brought a renewed focus to the safety of Boeing commercial jets, a record that included\u00a0two fatal crashes\u00a0in 2018 and 2019 that killed a total of 346 people. Boeing has\u00a0accepted legal liability\u00a0for those crashes, which were attributed to a\u00a0design flaw\u00a0in the 737 Max. The\u00a0Justice Department\u00a0is now investigating whether or not the latest Boeing issues brought to light in the wake of the Alaska Air incident would violate a controversial\u00a0deferred prosecution agreement\u00a0the company reached in 2021, which could open the company for criminal liability.

They also could spell trouble for your wallet and the broader US economy. One of America\u2019s biggest manufacturers is dealing with some serious production, quality and safety problems that worsened this week after a\u00a0787 Dreamliner plunged suddenly mid-flight, injuring dozens of passengers. It\u2019s not yet clear whether Boeing was to blame, but it came at a horrible time for a company grappling with some severe damage to its already-battered reputation. Boeing\u2019s crisis could result in more expensive airfares and weaker economic growth, economists say. The aircraft manufacturer is a massive company with a workforce of more than 140,000 employees around the world, generating tens of billions in revenue each quarter as one of two global players in the production of planes, the other being Airbus. Boeing\u2019s production alone represents a significant part of America\u2019s economy. But the country \u2013 and the world \u2013 relies on its planes for travel, business, deliveries and jobs.  Delays in deliveries, which Boeing and several airlines expect as it undergoes an intensive federal investigation of its manufacturing processes, could reduce the number of planes available to Americans and cut into all those economy-boosting benefits its normally provides. More expensive airfares Boeing\u2019s mid-flight disasters, most notably an Alaska Airlines 737 Max door plug that\u00a0blew off the side of the plane\u00a0shortly after takeoff, clearly mean the company has issues to address. Boeing has already slowed down production of its popular 737 Max jets as regulators scrutinize the company\u2019s practices, which has already led to fewer flights being scheduled as airlines brace for snags in deliveries. The sharp 6.1% drop in new orders for durable goods in January was largely due to fewer order for Boeing jets. Boeing reported this week that it shipped a meager 17 Max jets in February, which was half as much the company shipped in December. Southwest and United earlier this week said they expect Boeing to ship them fewer planes than they planned on receiving, so they\u2019ll hire fewer pilots. Fewer jets could also push up airfares. \u201cLess supply of airplanes coming online means there\u2019s going to be more demand for flying than capacity is able to fulfill, so that keeps upward pressure on airfares, all else equal,\u201d Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, told CNN. \u201cWe have already seen airfares jump the last few months and it was up 3.6% in February.\u201d Boeing\u2019s need to address its problems means it likely won\u2019t cut back on hiring, even if demand for its planes weakens. \u201cI don\u2019t see them trimming labor at a time of serious quality concerns and if anything, Boeing might try to hire more to get the quality issues right,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, told CNN. Higher labor costs would mean Boeing loses even more money, plunging the company into an even deeper financial hole. That would inflict even further damage to Boeing\u2019s already-beaten down stock price. Weaker US economic growth and a boon for Airbus When regulators believed Boeing would halt production of the 737 Max jet in January 2020, after two fatal incidents in 2019 and the subsequent grounding of those jets that year, the New York Fed estimated that the production shutdown could shave 0.4% from US gross domestic product in 2020, the broadest measure of economic output. (Boeing continued to build the 737 Max throughout the crisis). Then, of course, the pandemic happened, which dealt an even tougher blow to the company, resulting in nearly $12 billion in losses that year. The New York Fed analysis stated that \u201cBoeing is a large firm that is highly integrated in the domestic production network\u201d and that production stoppages can \u201chave significant effects on the macroeconomy.\u201d Since Boeing is the single largest US exporter, weaker demand for its planes would means fewer exports, which contribute to GDP growth if they exceed imports \u2014 known as \u201cnet exports.\u201d Boeing hasn\u2019t announced that it will stop producing any of its aircraft outright, but its plans to increase production of the 737 Max are on hold as the Federal Aviation Administration awaits for the company\u2019s plan on how to end its continued quality issues. And Boeing\u2019s years of problems have led to success for its French rival Airbus, which has overtaken Boeing as the world\u2019s largest aircraft manufacturer. It\u2019s not easy for airlines to switch manufacturers overnight, but the trend is clearly pointing in Airbus\u2019 favor, and if US imports of Airbus planes for domestic carriers pick up as Boeing indeed suffers weaker demand, that would then weigh on America\u2019s GDP. \u201cThe declining demand of plane orders by airlines for Boeing aircrafts might just get directed towards Airbus instead, and doesn\u2019t just disappear,\u201d Lisa Simon, chief economist at\u00a0Revelio Labs, wrote in a statement to CNN. She added that \u201cthis whole fiasco absolutely will likely have adverse effects on the aircraft manufacturing sector in the US\u201d and that it would be \u201cgood for the European market.\u201d", "articleSection": ["business", "economy"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Bryan Mena", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/bryan-mena"}], "dateModified": "2024-03-15T10:46:07.878Z", "description": "Boeing\u2019s problems aren\u2019t just Boeing\u2019s.

So how does CEO Dave Calhoun still have a job? \u201cIt\u2019s become an extreme embarrassment,\u201d Richard Aboulafia, a longtime aviation analyst, told me. \u201cThe board seems weirdly absentee, investors seem weirdly complacent, and the government doesn\u2019t seem to have a mechanism for dealing with this.\u201d Let\u2019s step back: Boeing\u2019s (BA) stock has shed more than a quarter of its value this year, and it\u2019s only March. One of its planes suffered a mid-flight blowout on January 5, prompting multiple federal investigations that increasingly suggest Boeing workers failed to put crucial bolts in place after making repairs. Last week, investigators called the company out for dragging its heels in response to their requests for key evidence. Boeing said it is working closely with regulators\u2019 investigations and has plans in place to improve safety measures at its production facilities. \u201cWe will continue supporting this investigation in the transparent and proactive fashion we have supported all regulatory inquiries into this accident,\u201d Boeing said in a statement. Boeing\u2019s 737 Max problems would be egregious enough on their own. But wait, there\u2019s more. On Monday, a Boeing\u00a0787 Dreamliner flying from Australia to New Zealand\u00a0plunged suddenly mid-flight,\u00a0injuring 50 passengers before landing safely. On Tuesday, news began emerging that a Boeing whistleblower, John Barnett, died in an apparent suicide on the same day he was scheduled to give testimony about safety concerns he raised over the company\u2019s safety protocols. It\u2019s not clear whether Boeing bears any responsibility in either case. The company said it was gathering information about what went wrong on the 787. And in response to its former employee\u2019s death, the company said: \u201cWe are saddened by Mr. Barnett\u2019s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.\u201d  Boeing lost its way If Boeing were any other company, its CEO would be out the door. But Dave Calhoun, Boeing\u2019s chief executive since 2020, remains in his job, as does the entire C-suite at the time of this writing. \u201cIt\u2019s been three years of \u2018there\u2019s no way Calhoun can stay at the helm,\u2019\u201d said Aboulafia, managing director of the consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory. \u201cBut he seems to be staying at the helm \u2026 I do not get it.\u201d Boeing actually raised Calhoun\u2019s total compensation in 2022, to $22.5 million, despite problems with the 777 program and quality control issues with the 787 that forced regulators to halt the company\u2019s deliveries. Calhoun\u2019s 2023 compensation has not yet been announced \u2014 Boeing typically reveals that information in April. To be fair to Calhoun, he took over a company in deep distress following two fatal 737 Max crashes that landed the crucial plane in a nearly two-year-long grounding and put the company in a yearslong crisis. And the plane maker\u2019s problems didn\u2019t start there: The 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas is widely cited as Boeing\u2019s poisoned chalice. It was after the merger that the bean-counter executives began taking over, gutting the joint, and putting accountants into roles once held by engineers. Maximizing profit took precedence over quality. In the short term, margins improved. But in the long term, Boeing lost the plot. Executives at Boeing, starting in the mid-aughts, \u201cidentified an industry with tons of cash flow, high barriers to entry and only two players,\u201d Aboulafia said, referring to Boeing\u2019s European rival, Airbus. \u201cIt\u2019s a recipe for getting away with bad things.\u201d Critics of the 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 weren\u2019t just a problem of flawed design but also deeply flawed management that eroded Boeing\u2019s corporate culture. Boeing hired Calhoun to right the ship and help return the plane maker to its engineering roots. Some questioned the move at the time, given that Calhoun himself was trained as an accountant and has no engineering background. Calhoun, who previously worked at the Blackstone Group, Nielsen and GE, was cut from the same cloth as Jim McNerney, who ran Boeing as CEO from 2005-2015, a tumultuous era marked by strained labor relations and cost-cutting. Under Calhoun, Boeing still hasn\u2019t been able to shake its enormous problems. This year\u2019s mounting concerns prove his efforts haven\u2019t resulted in sufficient quality and safety improvements. CNN has reached out to Boeing for comment. \u201cIf you ask me, the first thing that needs to happen for Boeing to gain trust is to basically fire the entire C suite,\u201d Gad Allon, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Business, told me Tuesday. \u201cI know that will not happen, but \u2026 there is not a single person that has a C in front of their title that is not responsible for what we\u2019re seeing now.\u201d But Allon isn\u2019t holding his breath for Boeing\u2019s board of directors to act. \u201cIf there is a functioning board, that\u2019s what should happen.\u201d", "articleSection": ["business"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Allison Morrow", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/allison-morrow"}], "dateModified": "2024-03-15T02:50:57.635Z", "description": "Hardly a day has gone by in 2024 without a bad headline for Boeing, from life-threatening mid-flight crises up above to entrenched business debacles happening on the ground.

The deep-space rocket system went through nearly an hour-long integrated flight test. The spacecraft was expected to splash down in the Indian Ocean at the conclusion of the flight, putting the gargantuan vehicle in a position to move on to more complex test flights and, eventually, carry NASA astronauts to the moon\u2019s surface. But after reentry the team lost two key pieces of communication at the same time: Contact with Starlink, SpaceX\u2019s internet service, and with TDRSS \u2014 or Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System. \u201cThe team has made the call that the ship has been lost, so no splashdown today,\u201d said Dan Huot, SpaceX communications manager, during the live broadcast. \u201cBut again, just it\u2019s incredible to see how much further we got this time around.\u201d SpaceX also never intended to recover Starship after this flight test. The spacecraft was expected to make a hard landing. And the Starship spacecraft made it much farther into flight than during two previous tests in 2023. The company routinely frames failures during these early test flights as normal. The goal of these flight tests is to gather crucial data so that engineers can go back and tinker with Starship, improving it for future missions. The Starship vehicle \u2014 which includes the upper Starship spacecraft and a rocket booster known as the Super Heavy \u2014 took off from SpaceX\u2019s private Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas, at 8:25 a.m. CT (9:25 a.m. ET). SpaceX considers the Starship system crucial to its founding mission: to carry humans to Mars for the first time. And critically, NASA has chosen Starship as the landing vehicle that will ferry its astronauts to the lunar surface on the Artemis III mission\u00a0slated to take off as soon as September 2026. \u201cCongrats to SpaceX on a successful test flight! Starship has soared into the heavens. Together, we are making great strides through Artemis to return humanity to the Moon\u2014 then look onward to Mars,\u201d wrote NASA Administrator Bill Nelson on X, formerly known as Twitter. The Super Heavy booster \u2014 the first stage, or bottommost part, of the launch vehicle roared to life and soared out over the Gulf of Mexico. The Super Heavy booster burned through most of its fuel and broke away from the Starship spacecraft, the upper stage that rides atop the Super Heavy. The booster was expected to make an autonomous, controlled landing in the ocean, but the booster \u201cdidn\u2019t light all the engines that we expected and we did lose the booster,\u201d Huot said. SpaceX said it\u2019s working to get video of what occurred before the booster hit the water. But the the booster made it farther into flight than a Super Heavy booster has previously made it. On the past two flights, Super Heavy was destroyed midair before it had a chance to try out landing maneuvers. Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the \u201cmishap\u201d involving both the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft. The agency licenses commercial rocket launches and oversees mishap investigations when spacecraft are lost during flight. Such investigations are routine and carried out whether or not SpaceX expects a loss of the vehicle. \u201cA mishap occurred during the SpaceX Starship OFT-3 mission that launched from Boca Chica, Texas, on March 14,\u201d according to a statement released by the FAA. \u201cNo public injuries or public property damage have been reported. The FAA is overseeing the SpaceX-led mishap investigation to ensure the company complies with its FAA-approved mishap investigation plan and other regulatory requirements.\u201d The third test flight occurred on SpaceX\u2019s 22nd anniversary, according to the livestream. Aiming for orbital speeds SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said a primary goal of these early test flights is to get Starship to orbital speeds \u2014 velocities quick enough to allow the spacecraft to enter a stable orbit around Earth. Typically, such a feat requires speeds topping 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 kilometers per hour). Starship reached its orbital speeds goal and did not aim to actually enter orbit on this flight. Starship tests and tech demos Starship burned its engine for about six minutes before it entered a coasting phase. The spacecraft ran through a few key tests and tech demonstrations. First, Starship reached speeds close to what would be required to put the vehicle in orbit. The Starship\u2019s payload door \u2014 a hatch that must open for the spacecraft to deploy satellites into space after reaching orbit \u2014\u00a0also swung open before resealing in a crucial test of that mechanism. SpaceX also carried out what the company is calling a \u201cpropellant transfer demonstration.\u201d The goal was to move some of the propellant on board the Starship vehicle from one tank to another, according to a December email from NASA explaining the test. SpaceX engineers designed that demo to begin hashing out how Starship will be refueled on future missions while it\u2019s in orbit. The team will \u201cneed to do some data review\u201d of both the payload door opening and the propellant transfer demonstration to determine how successful each test was, according to the live broadcast. However, after reaching several milestones, SpaceX revealed it opted not to attempt to reignite Starship\u2019s engines after a half-hour coasting phase that was originally planned for the flight test. Starship was on a \u201cpretty steep trajectory,\u201d Huot said. That meant Earth\u2019s gravity would likelrapidly drag Starship back toward Earth, whether or not engines are relit. It\u2019s not clear why SpaceX decided to forgo that test, but engineers noted a lot of data needs to be evaluated in the hours and days ahead. \u201cThe atmosphere is actually doing us a huge favor here by acting as a braking system for starship,\u201d said Kate Tice, one of the hosts of SpaceX\u2019s livestream. The Starship spacecraft is coated in about 18,000 lightweight, ceramic hexagon tiles designed to protect the vehicle from the scorching-hot temperatures as it plunges back into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. During the livestream, a vibrant halo of bright red plasma, created by extreme heat and pressure as Starship entered the atmosphere, could be seen glowing around the vehicle. Shortly after, the team lost communication with the spacecraft. NASA Artemis moon mission Topping off the spacecraft\u2019s fuel will be critical for Starship\u2019s high-profile missions down the road. When Starship makes a journey to the moon under NASA\u2019s Artemis program \u2014 it will have to sit in orbit close to Earth as SpaceX launches separate vehicles \u00a0that will transport only fuel to the spacecraft. To get to the moon, SpaceX may have to make more than a dozen refueling trips. SpaceX received approval from regulators on Wednesday to carry out this latest test flight. SpaceX\u2019s explosive test-flight process Musk has said he was more confident this flight will be successful compared with the 2023 attempts. A success would potentially give the company crucial data that could allow Starship to move on to more difficult test flights. \u201cI don\u2019t want to jinx it, but I think the probability of reaching orbit is good \u2014 80%,\u201d he said during a recent talk posted to social media. \u201cCertainly the third flight is a much better rocket than flights one or two.\u201d Still, SpaceX officials have repeatedly said the company does not expect 100% accuracy on these early test flights. \u201cEach of these flight tests continue to be just that: a test. They aren\u2019t occurring in a lab or on a test stand, but are putting flight hardware in a flight environment to maximize learning,\u201d the company said in a statement posted to its website. \u201cThis rapid iterative development approach has been the basis for all of SpaceX\u2019s major innovative advancements.\u201d", "articleSection": ["world"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Jackie Wattles", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/jackie-wattles"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ashley Strickland", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/ashley-strickland-profile"}], "dateModified": "2024-03-14T18:19:28.533Z", "description": "Starship, the most powerful rocket ever constructed, achieved multiple milestones during its third test flight before likely breaking apart.", "headline": "SpaceX\u2019s Starship reaches new heights in monumental test flight but lost on reentry", "image": [{"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240314095414-02-spacex-starship-launch-031424.jpg?c=original", "caption": "The SpaceX Starship spacecraft lifts off from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, on March 14, 2024.

Now the company\u2019s own future is in question. The once red-hot electric vehicle maker \u2014 heralded as part of the so-called Magnificent Seven behemoth tech stocks \u2014 is currently the worst performer in the S&P 500 this year, down nearly 32% since January. The story of Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) decline has been well documented. The company has been plagued by safety issues and recalls, slowing growth and has even been forced to slash prices. But a new report by Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan on Wednesday offers a darker picture than previously imagined. Tesla, he wrote, is a \u201cgrowth company with no growth.\u201d Langan predicts that Tesla\u2019s growth will remain flat this year and then decline in 2025 as competition increases, deliveries disappoint and the beleaguered auto and tech company is forced to cut prices again. UBS also downgraded its forecast for Tesla on Wednesday. Analysts said concerns are mounting as demand for electric vehicles slows and as Chinese rivals take an ever greater share of the global market. With the exception of Tesla, all of the Magnificent Seven companies (that also includes Apple, Amazon, Meta, Google, Nvidia and Microsoft) saw double- or triple-digit earnings growth in the final three months of 2023. Tesla reported a 40% decline in profit from the year before. Tesla has been navigating through a perfect storm. The EV environment is getting more crowded right as the company\u2019s fundamentals have come into question. Its share price has dropped about 60% from its 2021 all-time high of $407. But even with the recent drop in price, Tesla\u2019s stock is still very expensive when compared to its actual earnings and profits, said Langan. The company\u2019s former propensity for rapid growth is no longer certain, he said, and shares likely have further  to fall. Wells Fargo has lowered its price target for the stock from $200 to $125, predicting another 25% decrease in value.

The launch could take place anytime during a 110-minute window that opens at 7 a.m. CT (8 a.m. ET) Thursday, according to an email from SpaceX sent Wednesday afternoon. A live stream of the event will begin on the company\u2019s website about 30 minutes before takeoff. The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, gave SpaceX the final green light for the mission on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cThe FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental, policy and financial responsibility requirements,\u201d the agency said in a statement. This test flight comes after two attempts to get the massive Starship vehicle to orbital speeds in 2023 ended in explosions, with the spacecraft and booster erupting into flames before reaching their intended landing sites. SpaceX is known to embrace fiery mishaps in the early stages of spacecraft development, saying these failures help the company rapidly implement design changes that lead to better results. Much is riding on Starship\u2019s eventual success. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly characterized the rocket as central to the company\u2019s founding mission: putting humans on Mars for the first time. Crucially, the Starship spacecraft is also the vehicle NASA has\u00a0selected\u00a0to land astronauts launched from the United States on the moon for the first time in more than five decades as part of its Artemis program. The space agency is\u00a0in a race with China, vying to become first to develop a permanent lunar outpost and\u00a0set the precedent\u00a0for deep-space settlements. The US space agency has committed to investing up to $4 billion in Starship. Under NASA\u2019s current road map, Starship would complete the final leg of the agency\u2019s crewed mission to the moon, taking the astronauts from their spacecraft in lunar orbit and ferrying them down to the surface. The first astronaut landing under the Artemis program is slated to occur as soon as September 2026. What success looks like for SpaceX Musk has indicated that he believes Starship has a high chance of successfully completing this third test flight. \u201cI don\u2019t want to jinx it, but I think the probability of reaching orbit is good \u2014 80%,\u201d he said during a recent talk posted to social media. \u201cCertainly the third flight is a much better rocket than flights one or two.\u201d Musk said before the last Starship test flight in November that the vehicle had about a 50% chance of success. The vehicle was not meant to orbit Earth, but it was intended to reach the breakneck speeds that will be required when the vehicle does go into orbit. (Starship ultimately hit about 24,000 kilometers per hour, or 15,000 miles per hour. Reaching orbit typically requires hitting at least 17,500\u00a0miles per hour.) The November test flight marked a big improvement compared with Starship\u2019s inaugural liftoff in April 2023, when some of the rocket\u2019s 33 main engines flamed out and the vehicle began tumbling over the Gulf of Mexico. SpaceX destroyed the rocket just four minutes into that first flight to prevent it from veering off course. Starship made it much further in November, successfully igniting all its engines and completing a key flight milestone: stage separation. That\u2019s when the Super Heavy rocket booster \u2014 the bottommost portion of the rocket that gives the initial burst of power at liftoff \u2014 breaks away from the upper Starship spacecraft, allowing the vehicle to ignite its engines and continue the mission on its own power. But ultimately Starship was destroyed about 10 minutes into flight. If it had gone to plan, the mission would have lasted about an hour and a half. SpaceX has said its approach to rocket development is geared toward speed. The company makes use of an engineering method called \u201crapid spiral development.\u201d This process essentially boils down to a desire to build prototypes quickly and willingly blow them up to learn how to construct a better one \u2014 faster than if the company solely relied on ground tests and simulations. After the first and second Starship test flights ended in explosions, the company immediately\u00a0sought to frame these mishaps as successes. In a statement after the November launch, SpaceX said, \u201cWith a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today\u2019s test will help us improve Starship\u2019s reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multiplanetary.\u201d", "articleSection": ["world"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Jackie Wattles", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/jackie-wattles"}], "dateModified": "2024-03-13T21:07:18.825Z", "description": "SpaceX is once again set to launch its massive Starship rocket \u2014 the most powerful launch vehicle ever constructed \u2014 on a third test flight.", "headline": "SpaceX gets green light for third Starship test flight", "image": [{"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gifp-2ya0aahujf.jpg?c=original", "caption": "This undated handout photo shows SpaceX's Starship rocket at the company's launch base in Boca Chica, Texas.", "sourceOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Twitter"}, "width": "2000", "height": "1098", "creditText": "From SpaceX"}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gifp-2ya0aahujf.jpg?c=original", "caption": "SpaceX's Starship rocket appears at the company's launch base in Boca Chica, Texas, in an undated photo.", "sourceOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Twitter"}, "width": "2000", "height": "1098", "creditText": "From SpaceX"}], "thumbnailUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gifp-2ya0aahujf.jpg?c=original", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@context": "https://schema.org", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/13/world/spacex-starship-test-flight-scn/index.html", "dateModified": "2024-03-13T21:07:18.825Z", "inLanguage": "en", "additionalType": "article_leaf", "publisher": {"@type": "NewsMediaOrganization", "name": "CNN", "logo": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61", "foundingDate": "1980-06-01", "url": "https://www.cnn.com", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/cnn/", "https://twitter.com/CNN", "https://www.instagram.com/cnn/", "https://www.youtube.com/cnn"]}, "name": "SpaceX gets green light for third Starship test flight", "headline": "SpaceX gets green light for third Starship test flight", "description": "SpaceX is once again set to launch its massive Starship rocket \u2014 the most powerful launch vehicle ever constructed \u2014 on a third test flight.", "datePublished": "2024-03-13T21:07:18.825Z"}, "publisher": {"@type": "NewsMediaOrganization", "name": "CNN", "logo": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61", "foundingDate": "1980-06-01", "url": "https://www.cnn.com", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/cnn/", "https://twitter.com/CNN", "https://www.instagram.com/cnn/", "https://www.youtube.com/cnn"]}, "timeRequired": "P0Y0M0DT0H3M17S", "wordCount": 740, "datePublished": "2024-03-13T21:07:18.825Z", "isAccessibleForFree": false, "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": false, "cssSelector": ".article__content"}}, {"@type": "NewsArticle", "@context": "https://schema.org", "articleBody": "New Zealand authorities were able to remove the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from the Boeing 787-9 that experienced a \u201ctechnical event\u201d on Monday\u2019s LATAM Airlines Flight 800, a spokesman for New Zealand\u2019s transport safety body told CNN on Wednesday. The black boxes hold data crucial to understanding what caused the Boeing jet to suddenly drop during the flight from Australia to New Zealand, causing dozens of passengers to be treated for injuries. The technical glitch and subsequent investigations come at a fraught time for Boeing. The US manufacturer has faced harsh criticism for a series of recent safety and quality issues in its aircraft. A series of investigations Chile\u2019s Directorate General of Civil Aeronautics (DGAC)\u00a0is leading the investigation into the black boxes as the plane was registered in the country. New Zealand\u2019s Transport Accident Investigation Commission\u00a0(TAIC), will also contribute an investigator to the process. The Boeing jet remains in Auckland and will also be assessed by the Chilean investigators. The union representing the flight\u2019s crew said on Wednesday that it would conduct an investigation, we well. The LATAM Cabin Crew Union (STCLA) said in a statement to CNN Wednesday that it is \u201cgathering records of its colleagues who were injured\u201d during the incident. According to a statement published by LATAM Airlines, at least 10 passengers and three crew members were injured when the plane experienced a \u201ctechnical event.\u201d However, emergency medical services provider Hato Hone St John Ambulance in Auckland told CNN that approximately 50 people were treated for injuries upon arrival in Auckland, including one person in serious condition. Pilot may have temporarily lost control of the jet One of the passengers aboard the Chilean Boeing 787, Brian Jokat, told CNN that the pilot checked on the passengers and explained he had temporarily lost control of the jet. \u201cI immediately engaged with him and said, \u2018What was that?\u2019 And he openly admitted, he said, \u2018I lost control of the plane. My gauges just kind of went blank on me,\u2019\u201d Jokat said. STCLA told CNN that it is awaiting the results of the investigation \u201cnot only to know what happened, but also to be able to ask the company for any necessary improvements.\u201d CNN contacted LATAM Airlines Wednesday but has not received a comment. \u201cAviation is a complex activity, it involves significant risks and must be carried out safely, so carrying out our work with appropriate conditions is also guaranteeing the safety of aviation as a whole,\u201d STCLA said in its statement. A nightmare for Boeing Analysis of the LATAM Airline flight\u2019s black box data could shed light on Boeing\u2019s role in the flight\u2019s sudden drop. Boeing is in crisis after a series of mid-flight disasters in recent months have led to intense scrutiny of its quality standards. In January, a door plug blew off a new Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines, leaving a hole in the side of the plane mid-flight. Investigators from the US National Transportation Safety Board said evidence showed four bolts that are meant to hold the door plug were missing. On Wednesday, in a letter to a Senate committee probing Boeing, the National Transportation Safety Board said its investigation has been held back by Boeing\u2019s lack of a paper trail for key evidence. The most serious problem Boeing faced in recent years: two fatal crashes of its 737 Max jet due to a design flaw in the plane. Meanwhile, in February, the Federal Aviation Administration flagged safety issues with engine anti-ice systems on the 737 Max and larger 787 Dreamliner. \ufeffThe FAA said Monday it has given Boeing until late May to produce a plan to remedy issues identified in a federal audit and other reviews, including a safety culture survey of employees and a separate panel report that found workers concerned about retaliation for reporting safety concerns. - CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore, Kathleen Magramo,\u00a0Manveena Suri\u00a0and\u00a0Alex Stambaugh contributed to reporting.", "articleSection": ["business"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Angus Watson", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/angus-watson"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Delouya", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/samantha-delouya"}], "dateModified": "2024-03-14T02:20:06.683Z", "description": "New Zealand authorities were able to remove the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from the Boeing 787-9 that experienced a \u201ctechnical event\u201d on Monday\u2019s LATAM Airlines Flight 800, a spokesman for New Zealand\u2019s transport safety body told CNN on Wednesday.", "headline": "Investigators have removed black boxes from LATAM\u2019s plane that dropped suddenly", "image": [{"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2068304559.jpg?c=original", "caption": "The LATAM Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane that suddenly lost altitude mid-flight a day earlier, dropping violently and injuring dozens of terrified travellers, is seen on the tarmac of the Auckland International Airport in Auckland on March 12, 2024.", "width": "5519", "height": "3680", "creditText": "Brett Phibbs/AFP/Getty Images", "dateCreated": "2024-03-12T04:00:00.000Z"}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2068304559.jpg?c=original", "caption": "The LATAM Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane that suddenly lost altitude mid-flight a day earlier, dropping violently and injuring dozens of terrified travellers, is seen on the tarmac of the Auckland International Airport in Auckland on March 12, 2024.", "width": "5519", "height": "3680", "creditText": "Brett Phibbs/AFP/Getty Images", "dateCreated": "2024-03-12T04:00:00.000Z"}], "thumbnailUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2068304559.jpg?c=original", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@context": "https://schema.org", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/13/business/latam-airlines-black-box-boeing/index.html", "dateModified": "2024-03-14T02:20:06.683Z", "inLanguage": "en", "additionalType": "article_leaf", "publisher": {"@type": "NewsMediaOrganization", "name": "CNN", "logo": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61", "foundingDate": "1980-06-01", "url": "https://www.cnn.com", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/cnn/", "https://twitter.com/CNN", "https://www.instagram.com/cnn/", "https://www.youtube.com/cnn"]}, "name": "Investigators have removed black boxes from LATAM\u2019s plane that dropped suddenly", "headline": "Investigators have removed black boxes from LATAM\u2019s plane that dropped suddenly", "description": "New Zealand authorities were able to remove the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from the Boeing 787-9 that experienced a \u201ctechnical event\u201d on Monday\u2019s LATAM Airlines Flight 800, a spokesman for New Zealand\u2019s transport safety body told CNN on Wednesday.", "datePublished": "2024-03-13T20:48:26.516Z"}, "publisher": {"@type": "NewsMediaOrganization", "name": "CNN", "logo": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61", "foundingDate": "1980-06-01", "url": "https://www.cnn.com", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/cnn/", "https://twitter.com/CNN", "https://www.instagram.com/cnn/", "https://www.youtube.com/cnn"]}, "timeRequired": "P0Y0M0DT0H2M49S", "wordCount": 637, "datePublished": "2024-03-13T20:48:26.516Z", "isAccessibleForFree": false, "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": false, "cssSelector": ".article__content"}}, {"@type": "NewsArticle", "@context": "https://schema.org", "articleBody": "Investigators probing the Boeing 737 Max blowout say their investigation is being held back by Boeing\u2019s lack of a paper trail for key work.

Within the past six years, Boeing has been found responsible for two fatal crashes that killed 346 people, lost tens of billions of dollars, paid billions more in fines and settlements, and it made headlines for repeated quality control problems. But Boeing is not any other company. And it barely even has regulators to stand up to. The FAA is so underfunded that it has\u00a0partially\u00a0relied on Boeing to self-regulate.\u00a0It\u2019s a wonder that the agency found this week that Boeing failed half of its audit of its production facility. (The FAA has instructed the plane maker to submit a plan to fix its production problems by late May.) Boeing, in a statement, said it is working diligently to work out the issues highlighted by the FAA. \u201cBased on the FAA audit, our quality stand downs and the recent expert panel report, we continue to implement immediate changes and develop a comprehensive action plan to strengthen safety and quality, and build the confidence of our customers and their passengers,\u201d Boeing said in a statement. \u201cWe are squarely focused on taking significant, demonstrated action with transparency at every turn.\u201d Too big to fail The company is often called a duopoly, not a monopoly, because it is, technically, competing globally with its European rival Airbus. But it\u2019s not a true competition. Boeing\u2019s main customers are airlines, which can\u2019t suddenly switch to Airbus if they\u2019re upset with Boeing. Pilots are certified in one or the other, so once you make your choice, you\u2019re pretty much stuck with it. Given Boeing\u2019s singular importance in the American aviation industry, it is the definition of Too Big to Fail. Boeing is immune to most of the forces, like consumer choice, that other companies must contend with to stay in business. We the people couldn\u2019t get rid of it if we wanted to. So, how do we solve a problem like Boeing? \u201cIf you ask me, the first thing that needs to happen for Boeing to gain trust is to basically fire the entire C suite,\u201d Gad Allon, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Business, told me Tuesday. \u201cI know that will not happen, but \u2026 there is not a single person that has a C in front of their title that is not responsible for what we\u2019re seeing now.\u201d Allon isn\u2019t holding his breath for Boeing\u2019s board of directors on that front. Another idea that\u2019s occasionally bandied about: Nationalize Boeing. Matt Stoller, the director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project, a progressive think tank,\u00a0made that case in January\u00a0in his newsletter, arguing that the government has a history of nationalizing utilities, railroads and aerospace firms. And after all, he notes, Boeing already counts about 40% of its revenue from government contracts and much of the rest from plane orders that US officials regularly peddle abroad. \u201cBoeing is a state-backed national champion,\u201d Stoller wrote. \u201cThe fairy tale of a private firm is only hindering a fix to this once-great organization.\u201d Of course, Boeing isn\u2019t in the kind of financial distress that typically precedes a government takeover (a fact that\u2019s also courtesy of years of government support, but still). Nationalization seems politically interesting but practically unlikely. \u201cThere\u2019s really no short- and mid-term good option,\u201d Allon says. The bigger concern, for him, is what happens when these one-off scary events \u2014 door plugs ripping away mid-flight, etc \u2014 start becoming more frequent. \u201cThis can be really as big as a financial crisis,\u201d considering how many businesses around the world rely on Boeing planes. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I think that there is a risk of all of these planes falling from the sky tomorrow \u2026 [But] the moment we start seeing these things as more recurring, I think it moves from being an \u2018event risk\u2019 to a \u2018continuous risk\u2019 \u201d that could have devastating consequences.", "articleSection": ["business"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Allison Morrow", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/allison-morrow"}], "dateModified": "2024-03-14T15:49:03.981Z", "description": "It took decades for Boeing to build a reputation as one of the most reliable companies on the planet.

Although Alaska Airlines did not say why the plane was set to be taken out of service, the airline told the\u00a0New York Times, which first reported the scheduled safety check, that the plane was set to be removed from service to investigate two separate warning lights that alerted the crew to a potential pressurization problem on the plane over the 10 days prior to the blowout. Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, told CNN on January 8 that she was aware the plane had pressurization issues before the door plug blew out, and the safety regulator planned on probing Alaska Airlines about the incident. But the NTSB later clarified that it believed the pressurization warnings were unrelated to the side of the plane blowing out mid-air. The NTSB said the warning started appearing just weeks after the plane was delivered, in early December, and most recently happened the day before the door plug blowout incident. Max Tidwell, the vice president for safety and security for Alaska Airlines, told the New York Times that the airline did not believe the indicator lights posed a serious enough problem to take the plane out of service sooner without carrying passengers. Such deferred maintenance is common and legal, and the plane had made 154 successful flights before the blowout. In its preliminary investigation, the NTSB found that Boeing\u00a0probably did not put required bolts\u00a0in the door plug. The bolts are designed to prevent that part from blowing off the plane. It\u2019s not clear that an expedited maintenance schedule would have led Alaska Airlines to discover that problem. However, engineers were concerned enough about the warning lights that the airline prevented the plane from carrying passengers on long-haul routes over water in case of emergency, according to The New York Times. \u201cThe U.S. aviation system is the safest in the world because it relies on layers: redundant systems, robust processes and procedures, and the willingness to stop and ensure things are right before every takeoff,\u201d Alaska Airlines said in a statement. \u201cWe remain confident in our maintenance and safety actions leading up to the incident. We look forward to continuing our participation in a robust investigation led by the NTSB to ensure something like this never happens again.\u201d Alaska Airlines\u2019 (ALK) stock fell marginally in after-hours trading. The airline has largely avoided heavy scrutiny in the incident as blame has\u00a0largely been laid on Boeing\u00a0following the preliminary results of the probe. Boeing has been subject to congressional hearings, production and delivery delays, multiple federal investigations \u2014 including a criminal probe \u2014 and a stock that has lost more than a quarter of its value this year, shaving more than $40 billion off the company\u2019s market valuation. Although the revelation that the plane was scheduled for service the same day as the blowout does not necessarily suggest any wrongdoing by Alaska Airlines, it does raise further concerns about policies and regulations surrounding maintenance of America\u2019s fleet of aircraft.", "articleSection": ["business"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "David Goldman", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/david-goldman"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gregory Wallace", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/gregory-wallace"}], "dateModified": "2024-03-13T00:42:55.722Z", "description": "Alaska Airlines flight 1282, on which a door plug blew off the side of the plane shortly after takeoff on January 5, was scheduled to be taken out of service for maintenance the night of the incident, the airline said Tuesday.", "headline": "Alaska Airlines flight was headed for maintenance the same day part of the plane blew off", "image": [{"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1910141194.jpg?c=original", "caption": "PORTLAND, OREGON - JANUARY 7: In this National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) handout, plastic covers the exterior of the fuselage plug area of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 Boeing 737-9 MAX on January 7, 2024 in Portland, Oregon.

A news release from the Charleston County Coroner\u2019s Office said John Barnett, 62, died on March 9, from \u201cwhat appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\u201d The city\u2019s police department says detectives are investigating the case and \u201cawaiting the formal cause of death, along with any additional findings that might shed further light on the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Barnett.\u201d A statement provided to CNN by his lawyers says,\u00a0\u201cJohn was in the midst of a deposition in his whistleblower retaliation case, which finally was nearing the end. He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on. We didn\u2019t see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it.\u00a0We are all devasted [sic].\u00a0We need more information about what happened to John. The Charleston police need to investigate this fully and accurately and tell the public what they find out. No detail can be left unturned.\u201d His family told\u00a0NPR\u00a0the case was heading to trial in June, adding that Barnett was, \u201clooking forward to having his day in court and hoped that it would force Boeing to change its culture.\u201d The statement from his attorneys Robert Turkewitz and Brian Knowles described Barnett as \u201ca brave, honest man of the highest integrity. He cared dearly about his family, his friends, the Boeing company, his Boeing co-workers, and the pilots and people who flew on Boeing aircraft. We have rarely met someone with a more sincere and forthright character.\u201d A police incident report says officers were dispatched to conduct a welfare check at a Holiday Inn in Charleston shortly before 10:20 am on Saturday. When they arrived, responding officers found Barnett in the driver\u2019s seat of\u00a0a truck in the parking lot, with\u00a0a gunshot wound to the head.\u00a0He was holding a handgun. Barnett\u00a0was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. The police report also said there was a piece of paper found next to him that looked like a note. The incident report noted that the hotel had received a phone call from a \u201cRob,\u201d who requested the welfare check on \u201chis coworker John Barnett,\u201d which led hotel employees to the truck in the parking lot. The\u00a0BBC\u00a0reported that Barnett was in Charleston for legal interviews and\u00a0was scheduled for additional questioning on Saturday.\u00a0He was found dead after failing to appear. When reached for comment regarding Barnett\u2019s death, Boeing issued a statement saying, \u201cWe are saddened by Mr. Barnett\u2019s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.\u201d A statement from Charleston police indicated the department was aware the case has generated international attention, saying,\u00a0\u201cit is our priority to ensure that the investigation is not influenced by speculation but is led by facts and evidence.

The troubled aircraft maker reported 15 commercial jet orders in the month. That\u2019s a rebound from just three jet orders in January. But the company also had three canceled orders in January, giving it zero net orders for that month, the worst month for sales in years. The news wasn\u2019t all good: One of Boeing\u2019s largest customers, Southwest, disclosed Tuesday it now expects its deliveries from Boeing to be down more than 40% from what it had planned to accept over the course of the year. That\u2019s due to ongoing safety and quality questions about Boeing\u2019s production line raised by the door plug incident on a January 5 Alaska Air flight that left a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Because of that, the total capacity of seats Southwest sells during the course of the year will be 1 percentage point less than it originally expected, the airline said. Despite the challenges, Southwest CEO Bob Jordan signaled Southwest is not keen on adding planes from the other major airline manufacturer \u2014 Airbus \u2014 to its fleet.\u00a0That move would be an enormous change for Southwest, which exclusively flies the Boeing 737 and in 2011 became Boeing\u2019s first customer for the jet\u2019s latest generation, the Max. Southwest is making adjustments for the year. Jordan said Tuesday that the company is halting the hiring of pilots and flight attendants due to Boeing\u2019s expectation to deliver far fewer planes to Southwest than expected this year. \u201cThis is not business as usual,\u201d Jordan said at a conference organized by JP Morgan.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re being very aggressive in controlling what we can control.\u201d The hiring cuts mean Southwest will hire about 50% fewer pilots and 60% fewer flight attendants than planned this year.\u00a0New hire classes for both types of employees will stop in April.\u00a0After growth fueled by the post-pandemic air travel recovery, Jordan said Southwest now expects to end the year \u201csolidly down\u201d in employee headcount. But Jordan said Southwest is playing the long game and will deal with the delivery delays for now. \u201cI,\u00a0and I know other CEOs,\u00a0have told Boeing \u2026 get the issues understood, and get the issues fixed,\u201d Jordan said.\u00a0\u201cFix it. We all need Boeing to be stronger two years from now, five years from now, ten years from now.\u00a0And that takes precedent over delivery delays.\u201d United Airlines also said recently that it would halt pilot hiring\u00a0\u201cdue to continued new aircraft certification and manufacturing delays at Boeing.\u201d Rebound from worst month since pandemic January had been the worst month for sales for Boeing since airlines were struggling with massive losses during the pandemic. The last time Boeing had between one and three gross orders was in June, 2020, when it had only one jet order. The last time that Boeing had zero or negative net orders was in January of 2021, when it had negative 1 net orders. So while 15 orders in February is an improvement, it\u2019s still sharply off from relatively strong sales it reported for 2023, as a return of passengers had airlines eager to order and take deliveries on new planes.  Boeing had 369 total net orders in December alone, a\u00a0record month for the company. For the full year it had 1,456 gross orders, or 121 a month on average, and 929 of those orders coming in the second half of last year as demand picked up, for an average of 155 a month. So 15 orders booked for February showed a sharp drop from 2023 demand levels. The company sold 10 of the troubled 737 Max jets in February, all to unidentified customers. It sold four of the 787 Dreamliner to Royal Brunei Airlines, a deal announced during the Singapore Airshow. And it sold one 777 freighter, also to an unidentified customer. Deliveries hurt by quality questions Deliveries were somewhat better, but also below normal output for the company. Boeing delivered 17 737 Max jets, including two each to United Airlines, Southwest and Ryanair, and one each to Air India, Akasa, flydubai, Korean Air, Sun Express, and one each to six Chinese airlines \u2013 Air China, and China Southern, Xiamen, Shandong, Donghai and 9 Air. Overall it delivered 27 commercial jets.  The deliveries to China were significant, as China had not taken any Max deliveries from Boeing for nearly five years, following a second fatal crash in March 2019 caused a two-year grounding of the plane in China. Even after Chinese airlines were cleared by Chinese aviation regulators to start flying the 737 Max jets they owned once again, the airlines there had not taken a delivery of a Max until late January, when China Southern accepted delivery of a Max. But as Boeing deals with quality and safety issues since the Alaska Air incident, its deliveries are likely to be slowed for the rest of this year. Last year it delivered 528 commercial jets, or an average of 44 a month. The FAA has announced that it will not approve Boeing\u2019s plans to increase production of the 737 Max until it is satisfied it has made improvement in safety and quality issues. Southwest, one of its major customers, disclosed Tuesday that it expects to take deliveries of 46 737 Max 8 jets this year, rather than its previous plan to take 58 of those planes. Southwest had planned to also take delivery of a total of 79 737 Max jets, but it no longer expects to get any of the 737 Max 7 jets it had hoped to get this year. That plane has yet to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration to carry passengers and is now not likely to get that approval this year as it originally hoped.", "articleSection": ["business", "investing"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Chris Isidore", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/chris-isidore"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gregory Wallace", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/gregory-wallace"}], "dateModified": "2024-03-12T21:31:54.598Z", "description": "Boeing reported a minor bounce back in sales in February after orders ground essentially to a halt in January following the Alaska Airlines door plug incident.", "headline": "Boeing sales unfreeze but they\u2019re still well below normal", "image": [{"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2051578389.jpg?c=original", "caption": "A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 arrives at Daniel K.

But on Monday, a 787 Dreamliner plunged suddenly mid-flight, injuring dozens of passengers, after a pilot said he temporarily lost control of the aircraft. The pilot was able to recover and land the plane safely, but it\u2019s not yet clear what caused the LATAM flight from Australia to New Zealand to fall so dramatically. LATAM called it a \u201ctechnical event.\u201d Boeing said it\u2019s working to gather more information. But it\u2019s not news Boeing\u2019s management (or the flying public) needed right now. The company\u2019s nonstop streak of bad news began the first weekend of the year, when part of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max blew off the side of the plane just after takeoff. A preliminary federal investigation revealed that Boeing probably did not put the bolts in the so-called door plug that are designed to prevent the part from blowing off the plane. That incident resulted in a temporary nationwide grounding of certain 737 Max jets, followed by congressional hearings, production and delivery delays, multiple federal investigations \u2014 including a criminal probe \u2014 and a stock that has lost a quarter of its value this year, shaving more than $40 billion off the company\u2019s market valuation. Between lawsuits, potential fines and lost business, Boeing could lose billions more dollars from the blowout. But the bad news didn\u2019t stop there. In February, pilots on a United Airlines 737 Max reported that the flight controls jammed as the plane landed in Newark. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. Two weeks ago, the Federal Aviation Administration flagged safety issues with the de-icing equipment on 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner models that could cause engines to lose thrust. The FAA is allowing the planes to continue flying and Boeing said the problem does not pose an immediate safety risk. Then, last week, Boeing got more bad news: The NTSB said Boeing has not yet provided the company\u2019s records documenting the steps taken on the assembly line for the door plug replacement on the Alaska Airlines jet. Boeing\u2019s reason: Those records don\u2019t actually exist. And the FAA said Boeing\u2019s safety and quality problems extend beyond its inability to produce paperwork. Reviewing Boeing\u2019s production workflow and standards, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said Monday that the regulator found issues with \u201creally important\u201d aspects of Boeing\u2019s manufacturing and assembly line. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just paperwork issues,\u201d Whitaker said at a news conference.\u00a0\u201cSometimes, it\u2019s the order the work is done.\u00a0Sometimes it\u2019s tool management.\u00a0It sounds kind of pedestrian, but it\u2019s really important in a factory that you have a way of tracking your tools effectively so that you have the right tool and that you know you haven\u2019t left it behind.\u201d Boeing has said it is working on several of the issues Whitaker identified. The FAA has instructed the plane maker to submit a plan to fix its production problems by late May. \u201cBased on the FAA audit, our quality stand downs and the recent expert panel report, we continue to implement immediate changes and develop a comprehensive action plan to strengthen safety and quality, and build the confidence of our customers and their passengers,\u201d Boeing said in a statement. \u201cWe are squarely focused on taking significant, demonstrated action with transparency at every turn.\u201d Boeing\u2019s (BA) stock, which fell 3% Monday on the news about the terrifying LATAM flight, is down another 4.5% Tuesday. It\u2019s the second-worst performer in the S&P 500, behind only Tesla. But Boeing\u2019s awful start to 2024 is about much more than its stock price. The company came into the year with an already bruised reputation. Restoring the confidence of airlines, regulators and passengers becomes more difficult with every new incident and bad headline.

Passenger Brian Jokat described the horrifying moment when he was woken from his sleep as the aircraft \u201cdropped something to the effect of 500 feet instantly.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s when I opened my eyes and there was various individuals at the top of the plane. Just stuck to the roof and then they fell to the floor. And then I just realized I\u2019m not in a movie, this is actually for real,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. After landing in Auckland, Jokat said\u00a0the pilot checked on the passengers and explained he had temporarily lost control of the jet. \u201cI immediately engaged with him and said, \u2018What was that?\u2019 And he openly admitted, he said, \u2018I lost control of the plane. My gauges just kind of went blank on me,\u2019\u201d Jokat said. \u201cHe said for that brief moment he couldn\u2019t control anything and that\u2019s when the plane did what it did. Then he said the gauges came back and it reengaged, the plane just reengaged to its normal flight pattern. And we had no issues before, no issues after. But just that moment.\u201d The plane, operated by Chile\u2019s flag carrier, was a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. LATAM on Monday said the plane \u201chad a technical event during the flight which caused a strong movement,\u201d adding it had landed as scheduled in Auckland. In a statement to CNN Tuesday, Boeing said it was \u201cworking to gather more information about the flight and will provide any support needed by our customer.\u201d About 50 people were injured in the incident, with one person in serious condition, emergency services said. Jokat said he feared for his life when he saw fellow passengers fly out of their seats and hit the ceiling of the plane. \u201cPeople were screaming and crying. And yeah, it was mass chaos for a few short seconds,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly there was a moment in my head that I just kind of resigned to the fact this could be it. This might be it.\u201d Boeing\u2019s troubles As investigators scramble to discover what might have caused the sudden drop, the incident comes at a fraught time for Boeing. The US manufacturer has faced harsh criticism for a series of quality and safety issues in recent years, with many critics saying the company has shifted its focus in the last few decades to\u00a0financial results at the cost of safety and quality\u00a0in its aircraft. They include\u00a0two fatal crashes\u00a0of the 737 Max jet due to a design flaw in the plane, numerous halts in deliveries due to quality control issues and, most recently, a\u00a0door plug that blew off\u00a0of a new 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines in January, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration in February flagged safety issues with engine anti-ice systems on the 737 Max and larger 787 Dreamliner. The safety regulator continues to allow both models of the plane to fly despite the potential problems. Both issues are moving through the FAA\u2019s standard process for developing airworthiness directives \u2014 rather than an emergency process \u2014 signaling that the agency and plane maker do not believe the issues are serious enough to require the planes to stop flying immediately. The FAA said Monday it has given Boeing until late May to produce a plan to remedy issues identified in a federal audit and other reviews, including a safety culture survey of employees and a separate panel report that found workers concerned about retaliation for reporting safety concerns. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said he expects the company to produce \u201ca very detailed plan within the next 90 days to fix the quality issues that are out there.\u201d Boeing has said it is working on several of the issues Whitaker identified.", "articleSection": ["travel"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Kathleen Magramo", "url":

His daughter, Samya Rose Stumo, was killed that day when the Boeing 737 Max 8 she was on plunged into the ground just outside Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, six minutes after the plane took off. She was 24 years old. \u201cPart of our life is dead. Part of our future is dead,\u201d he told CNN, as the fifth anniversary of the crash approached. \u201cShe had it all. She was brilliant. She was the most published student in the Copenhagen School of Public Health. She taught herself to read before she was four. She went to college at 14. She was beautiful, charismatic. Her smile could light up the room. She was very caring. She would have been a star in the world of global health.\u201d Samya Rose was flying from Ethiopia to Kenya as part of her new job with a health systems development organization. Even though the same jet model had crashed soon after taking off from Indonesia less than six months earlier, aviation authorities around the world had allowed the 737 Max to keep flying with passengers. Michael Stumo said he never gave the plane or his daughter\u2019s flying plans much thought. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think about air travel. We didn\u2019t pay attention to the airline, the aircraft model,\u201d he said. \u201cWe pay hyper attention to planes now. We\u2019d never fly a Max.\u201d The March 10 anniversary is a difficult one for the families of the 157 people on board the Ethiopian jet, because concerns over Boeing\u2019s safety and quality have been in the news so much in the last two months. A third incident This year, on January 5, a part of a 737 Max 9 flown by Alaska Airlines blew out, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Fortunately, it was able to land minutes later without any fatalities or serious injuries. A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the plane had left a Boeing factory and was delivered to Alaska Air less than three months before, all while missing four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place.   Boeing has announced steps to improve safety and quality since the incident, including an all-employees safety meeting the week following the blowout, and shutting production at the Max factory for a day later that month to talk further about how to improve safety. But the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not satisfied: The regulator gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to deal with safety gaps. Some of the families of the Ethiopian crash victims welcomed the intense regulatory scrutiny on Boeing following January\u2019s door plug blowout. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re happy that it happened. But it\u2019s a mixed blessing. Something bad was going to happen, but in this case, nobody died,\u201d Stumo said. \u201cWith our crash it was focus on the design. It wasn\u2019t on the production chaos. The production problems really came to the fore this time.\u201d Zipporah Kuria, 28, who lost her 55-year-old father, Joseph, on the same flight, said her entire life was uprooted by the crash. \u201cI think my initial impression, what an unfortunate accident,\u201d she recalled about the 2019 crash. \u201cThen when I heard later that day this is not the first of these accidents, and that both were relatively new planes, my mind went to \u2018something\u2019s not right.\u2019\u201d Like Stumo, she became involved with trying to hold Boeing accountable for its failures, spending hours every week on the issue, reaching out to aviation regulators, speaking out publicly, and trying to bring more public attention to Boeing\u2019s production and safety problems. \u201cIt\u2019s robbed me of time and opportunity and peace of mind, and most importantly, my dad,\u201d she said this past week. \u201cI haven\u2019t had the capacity to fall in love and build a life with somebody else because this has been the center of my life. When I think \u2018I\u2019m going to focus on other parts of my life now,\u2019 a door falls off a plane and we\u2019re back in the Boeing circus.\u201d But like Stumo, Kruia says she is pleased that the Alaska Air incident has brought attention to the fact that the problems at Boeing were not fixed when the 737 Max planes returned to service after the 20-month grounding. Boeing\u2019s production problems went beyond the design flaw that led to the crashes. The company, for five years, has faced repeated quality and potential safety issues with its aircraft, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and the halt in deliveries of others. But the problems, including de-icing equipment that could fail on 737 and 787 Dreamliner planes, engine issues for the 777 and repeated quality control concerns for the 787\u2019s fuselage, failed to capture much attention from the public. The frightening door plug incident, however, shined a spotlight on the years of safety concerns at the company. \u201cWhen that happened, and everyone on the plane was fine, there was a relief,\u201d Kuria said. \u201cThis is the smoking gun we\u2019ve been waiting for the world to see, to wake up and have Boeing be exposed.\u201d Pressure for business as usual, and a deferred prosecution The victims\u2019 families, and the attorney who has represented many of them, are particularly angry that the Max continued to fly after the first accident demonstrated a design flaw, a problem with a single sensor that would push the nose of the jet down if it sensed an imminent stall. Boeing continued to insist that the plane was safe, not only after the first crash but for days after the second crash. Boeing only later admitted to the design flaw as part of the investigations and lawsuits that disclosed internal discussions about the problems with the design soon after the first crash. \u201cWithin days of the first crash, Boeing knew there was a design defect,\u201d Robert Clifford, one of the plaintiff attorneys in the case, told CNN. \u201cRather than alert all the operators about this defect, they believed they could get ahead of the curve. That\u2019s not what happened. They gambled with people\u2019s lives and the people lost.\u201d In 2021 Boeing\u00a0admitted to liability\u00a0in the two crashes, agreeing to pay compensatory damages, which allowed the company to avoid the possibility of having to pay far more in punitive damages. It also agreed to a controversial deferred prosecution agreement with the US Justice Department on charges that it defrauded the FAA when getting the original certification for the Max. Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion as part of the settlement \u2013 but most of that money was paid to the airlines as compensation for the 20-month grounding of the jets. Those were payments that Boeing had already agreed to make. Since the Alaska Air incident the Justice Department has started reviewing whether deficiencies found in the wake of the\u00a0door plug blowout\u00a0on a 737 Max flight violate that deferred prosecution agreement,\u00a0according to a person familiar with the investigation. The results of the probe could subject Boeing to criminal liability, depending on its outcome. Boeing acknowledged in a January regulatory filing that the Justice Department was looking at whether it had fulfilled the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement, but the company told CNN it had no further comment on the latest Justice Department probe. But beyond the many probes and audits and investigations of Boeing, many family members are still angry that the jet was allowed to start flying again after the company made changes to that system after a 20-month grounding. They say the Alaska Air incident demonstrates the problems at Boeing go much deeper than the design issue that was fixed. Some say they extend to production issues and to severe problems in the organizational structure at Boeing. The company declined to comment. Boeing\u2019s CEO Dave Calhoun acknowledged at a companywide safety meeting that the company made a mistake with the door plug blowout and the company has pledged to improve safety. Last month, Boeing removed executive Ed Clark, the head of its\u00a0737 Max\u00a0passenger jet program. \u2018A swampy cesspool\u2019 Since the Alaska Air incident, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a report that had been in the works for more than a year, sharply critical of the safety culture at Boeing. Despite statements from Boeing management about a renewed commitment to safety, the FAA found \u201csafety-related messages or behaviors are not being implemented across the entire Boeing population.\u201d The panel, which conducted more than 250 interviews and reviewed more than 4,000 pages of documents, found that among Boeing employees there was a \u201chesitation in reporting safety concerns for fear of retaliation\u201d because of management conflicts of interest. The report also said confusion about the safety programs \u201cmay discourage employees from submitting safety concerns.\u201d A separate FAA follow-up report focused on the Alaska Air incident and found multiple problems with Boeing\u2019s production practices. The agency has given Boeing\u00a090 days to produce the plan\u00a0to fix its quality issues. Boeing insists it is making a renewed commitment to safety and fixing production problems, and that the company is working to satisfy the concerns expressed by the FAA. Asked for a comment on the fifth anniversary of the Ethiopian crash, the company responded, \u201cWe will never forget the lives lost on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Lion Air Flight 610 and their loved ones. Their memory and the hard lessons we learned from these accidents drive us every day to uphold our responsibility to all who depend on the safety and quality of our products.\u201d But the victims\u2019 families are hardly satisfied with that statement or other apologies issued by Boeing and its executives over the last five years. They say they won\u2019t stop pushing for changes at Boeing until the top management at the company is replaced. \u201cThe blame lies with Boeing management. Until David Calhoun and Chief \u2018Safety\u2019 Officer Mike Delaney are gone, it won\u2019t change,\u201d Stumo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a swampy cesspool.\u201d Stumo and some other family members of victims met with previous Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg in 2019 after he testified about the crashes in Washington. Asked if he would like to meet with Calhoun, Stumo paused for a long moment before responding, \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d But Kuria said she\u2019d like to meet with Calhoun and other Boeing executives. \u201cJust to find out how these people sleep at night,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do you kiss your children and hug your wife knowing there\u2019s a group of families never get to do that because of the decisions made.\u201d", "articleSection": ["business"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Chris Isidore", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/profiles/chris-isidore"}], "dateModified": "2024-03-10T11:30:37.780Z", "description": "Michael Stumo\u2019s life changed forever on March 10, 2019.

Instead of basing most of white-collar employees\u2019 bonuses on financial results, bonuses will now be based mostly on safety and quality metrics. The company has faced harsh criticism for a series of quality and safety issues in recent years, with many of those critics saying the company has shifted its focus in the last few decades to financial results at the cost of safety and quality in its aircraft. But those safety and quality problems have resulted in five years of operating losses topping $31.5 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very important to drive the outcomes that we\u2019re all committed to, and that\u2019s to deliver a safe and quality product to our customer,\u201d said Chief Operating Officer Stephanie Pope on Thursday in comments to employees announcing the new bonus formulas. The troubled aircraft maker said 60% of the annual incentive score used to determine bonuses for employees of its commercial airplane unit will now be based on safety and quality metrics. It previously had 75% of that score based on financial results, with the other 25% based on operational metrics that included data beyond safety and quality readings. For the company\u2019s defense, space and security unit, as well as its global services division, operating metrics will continue to determine only 25% of the bonus formula, but that 25% will be changed to focus solely on safety and quality. For employees in the corporate offices, their bonus score will be based on an average of the three units scores. Among the safety and quality issues of recent years have been two fatal crashes of the 737 Max jet due to a design flaw in the plane, numerous halts in deliveries due to quality control issues and, most recently, a door plug that blew off of a new 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines in January of this year, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. The National Transportation Safety Board has determined that aircraft left a Boeing factory without the four bolts need to keep the door plug in place. It has yet to assess blame for the accident, but CEO Dave Calhoun has accepted responsibility for the incident. \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that,\u201d he told investors during a call after reporting the latest quarterly loss at the company. \u201cWhatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories.

A commercial airliner with a strong safety record carrying 239 people vanishing from the map, spawning a wide variety of competing theories, books and documentaries and leaving the families of those left behind asking themselves every March 8 \u2013 what happened to those aboard Malaysia Airlines flight 370? In an era when black boxes have been successfully hauled up from the very depths of the ocean and whole chunks of a downed airliner painstakingly pieced back together to determine what caused a catastrophe, the fate of MH370 remains infuriatingly elusive. It is a plane crash without a plane. A disaster without conclusive proof of what happened to its victims. A story that anyone who embarks on a commercial flight can instantly relate to but one that, for now at least, doesn\u2019t have a closing chapter. Yet many experts believe there is still a strong chance MH370\u2019s wreckage could be located, if someone looks hard enough and \u2013 crucially \u2013 coughs up the staggering amount of money that might be required to achieve that goal. For Jiang Hui, who lost his mother in the disaster, this time of year is especially tough \u2013 and not just because of the March 8 anniversary. Qingming, the annual festival when Chinese people visit and clean their ancestors\u2019 graves, falls in early April. \u201cBut we never found MH370. I never found my mother,\u201d Jiang told CNN. \u201cI can\u2019t commemorate my mother just like everyone else.\u201d His mother, Jiang Cuiyun, is still listed as \u201cmissing\u201d back home in China, he said. \u201cI will only find my mom if I can find MH370,\u201d he added. Beijing-bound Malaysia Airlines flight 370 dropped off the radar shortly after departing Kuala Lumpur in the small hours of March 8, 2014. The take-off was uneventful. The flight reached its cruising altitude of 35,000 feet and the pilots spoke briefly with Vietnamese air traffic as the plane headed on its standard route. After that the aircraft stopped communicating, then vanished from radar when it made an unexpected turn to the west. Apparent fragments have since washed up on the eastern coast of Africa and islands in the Indian Ocean, where the aircraft and those on board are believed to have met their fate. But to this day, the body of the aircraft and its black box has never been found. It\u2019s believed to have crashed. But we still don\u2019t know why. A new search? This week, many loved ones of those missing returned to Malaysia to urge local authorities to relaunch a search ahead of Friday\u2019s anniversary. \u201cThere have been ships lost that are found after hundreds of years. So we cannot say that this plane will never be found,\u201d one family member V.P.R Nathan told Reuters during a recent commemorative event. His wife Anne Daisy was on board MH370. \u201cOf course it can be found. It is a matter of time,\u201d he said. Aviation experts tell CNN that improved detection technology will likely bring families closer to the missing plane than they ever have been, if a search were to be relaunched. But that will not be cheap. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent scouring more than 710,000 square kilometers of the Indian Ocean until 2018, but nothing transpired that moved our understanding on from that already available since the very early days. United States-based sea exploration firm Ocean Infinity is offering the Malaysian government another \u201cno-find, no-fee\u201d deal - like they did in 2018 - but experts noted the authorities would still have to pay up if the aircraft was found. To families\u2019 encouragement, Malaysian authorities have made some positive remarks about the prospect of a new search. On Sunday, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said his country would \u201cdo everything possible to solve this mystery once and for all.\u201d He said his ministry is \u201cready\u201d to discuss a new \u201ccredible\u201d search proposal with Ocean Infinity and will do \u201ceverything possible\u201d to get Cabinet approval for a new contract with the firm. \u201cAs we approach the 10 years remembrance of this heart-wrenching tragedy, it is a painful reminder of the decade-long journey of grief and resilience that loved ones of the victims have endured,\u201d he said. Oliver Plunkett, CEO of Ocean Infinity, said since the 2018 search, the company has been honing its robotics and sea-exploration technology, while working with analysts to narrow down search areas to \u201cone in which success becomes potentially achievable.\u201d \u201cWe hope to get back to the search soon,\u201d he said in a recent statement. But neither Ocean Infinity nor the Malaysian government have given more concrete details on their possible plans. Competing theories With little facts established, the disappearance of MH370 has puzzled the world and set off all kinds of theories over the years, from mechanical failure to accidental or deliberate pilot error and even some sort of hijacking. Where facts end and the mystery begins is around 40 minutes into the flight when the plane\u2019s transponder stopped transmitting. Its blips soon disappeared from civilian and military radar. Subsequent traces eventually led experts to conclude the aircraft had flown drastically off course. Instead of flying northeast across the South China Sea, analysts believed it turned back and glided south inexplicably over the Indian Ocean, one of the world\u2019s most remote locations in terms of flight monitoring due to the lack of imaging satellites, according to aviation experts. \u201cThis has all the hallmarks of a spy thriller, an espionage thriller. And it\u2019s captured the world\u2019s imagination,\u201d Geoffrey Thomas, editor-in-chief of AirlineRatings.com, said. \u201cEverybody can place themselves on a Boeing 777. Everybody can place themselves flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so real.\u201d An initial search, carried out by Malaysia, China, and Australia and estimated to have cost 200 million Australian dollars ($132 million), was called off in January 2017 after failing to find any trace. Ocean Infinity was then brought in by the Malaysian government on a no-find, no-fee basis. But its 90-day search in 2018 also failed to bear fruit. Richard Quest, CNN\u2019s Business editor-at-large and former Aviation Correspondent said despite years of search efforts, \u201cthe real truth is we are no closer to knowing exactly what caused the plane to go missing.\u201d \u201cThe hope is that new search techniques, new equipment, and better understanding of what happened to the plane will make this search successful,\u201d said Quest, author of\u00a0\u201cThe Vanishing of Flight MH370.\u201d Breakthrough in technology Aviation experts are confident about a breakthrough, if a new search is to be conducted. They pointed to a piece of technology called Weak Signal Propagation Reporter, or WSPR (pronounced whisper),\u00a0released in 2008. The technology has become popular among those looking for MH370 in recent years. Radio amateurs use it to track the strength of radio signals around the world and the data they collect catch anomalies caused by various types of interferences, which include a flight passing through, retired British Aerospace engineer Richard Godfrey explained to CNN. Godfrey said he traced WSPR data back to the time when MH370 disappeared and concluded the aircraft may be lying between 3,000 and 4,000 meters (9,800 to 13,000 feet) below the Indian Ocean, about 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) off the coast of Perth, Australia. As thorough as past searches might be, Godfrey said, they have not covered the location he suggested. \u201cI certainly believe MH370 can be found,\u201d he said, adding that his findings are in line with other hints, such as data provided by British satellite telecommunications company Inmarsat, which pointed to more or less the same area. But even if another expedition is granted, he said, preparation work could take months. AirlineRatings\u2019s Thomas has \u201ca strong feeling\u201d Godfrey is right but raises another anxiety. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that they\u2019re just giving the relatives some warm, comfortable statements on the anniversary,\u201d he said, of the Malaysian authorities. Reality hits Some relatives, like American Sarah Bajc, who lost her partner Phil Wood, have tried to move on. But she still feels like she is living in the shadow of the past from time to time. Since the flight\u2019s disappearance, Bajc has moved from Asia to Panama, where she remarried and opened an eco-resort that allows her and her husband to live off grid in the rainforest. But to this day, she avoids watching dramas and documentaries about plane crashes and has recurring nightmares. \u201cI would have nightmares of diving in this beautiful area with lots of fish. And then all of a sudden, the plane hull would be there, and the bodies would be floating,\u201d she said. On the prospect of a new search, she is sanguine. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re ready to do that, in which case I\u2019m very happy because \u2026 the families need closure, the world needs closure, and somebody needs to be held accountable,\u201d she said, of the prospect of another search being launched by Malaysia. Others, like Jiang, are determined to get to the bottom of the truth. He says not a day goes by when he doesn\u2019t think of his mother, who he described as a strong and hardworking woman he idolized as an inspirational figure. \u201cI can find her shadow in me. Whatever I am doing now is what my mother wants me to do,\u201d he said. Jiang is among the 40 families who launched another bid back home last year to seek justice through the Chinese legal system. Those on board came from a multitude of nationalities but China was hit by far the hardest with 153 passengers. The claimants in China are suing Malaysia Airlines, its insurer, Boeing and the manufacturer of the plane\u2019s engine, demanding compensation, a formal apology, and the resumption of psychological assistance to family members, as well as the creation of a fund to continue searches for the plane. It\u2019s unclear, however, how much jurisdiction Chinese courts will have over the list of companies with headquarters overseas. Having spent the past few days meeting Malaysian officials, Jiang is optimistic about a new search.

Airfares are down If you\u2019re searching for a silver lining, look to the clouds. While the cost of living is spiraling and hitting groceries and other everyday costs hard, the price of plane tickets is at a 15-year low \u2013 in the United States, at least. Travel expert Katy Nastro tells CNN Business that average airfare is nearly a quarter less than it was prepandemic, and in fact, \u201chasn\u2019t been this cheap since 2009.\u201d This is the first full \u201cnormal\u201d year of travel since Covid rocked our world, and while Nastro doesn\u2019t expect prices to skyrocket anytime soon, she does sound one note of warning. \u201cThe single biggest factor for why we see cheap flights is competition,\u201d says Nastro. \u201cWe want (budget) carriers in the mix because it actually places downward pressure on the legacy carriers\u201d and keeps prices down. Airline mergers could affect that, meaning less competition and, potentially, higher fares. But this week, a federal judge\u00a0blocked a merger\u00a0of JetBlue and Spirit Airlines.

Californian Katie Meyer moved to the Portuguese seaside resort of Cascais in 2021, but admits she does find some things frustrating.

Nvidia isn\u2019t the only stock capturing the attention of AI enthusiasts these days. Nvidia is undoubtedly the poster child for artificial intelligence. Shares of the American chipmaker have soared roughly 277% over the last 12 months, helping drive a powerful bull market that\u2019s led stocks to record highs. Nvidia closed above a $2 trillion market cap on March 1, joining an elite cohort including Apple and Microsoft. But there\u2019s another AI-related stock that has quietly logged eye-popping gains. Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) have surged about 296% so far in 2024, following a 246% jump in 2023. Supermicro\u2019s stock gained even more momentum in January, after the company reported second-quarter results that blew past expectations and raised its full-year revenue forecast. Supermicro\u2019s stock was one of the most popular names bought by Charles Schwab clients in February, according to the firm\u2019s latest trading activity index. The server producer counts Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices among its customers. Its stock had risen at a breakneck pace even before last year\u2019s bull market. The shares jumped roughly 87% in 2022, while other tech names and the broader market got pummeled as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates aggressively to bring down wayward inflation. Supermicro\u2019s runaway gains are indicative of the burgeoning demand for high-quality infrastructure to support AI chips, after the creation of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in November 2022 kickstarted a race among tech behemoths to develop generative AI platforms and tools. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom. The chipmaker, which produces processors that power AI systems, reported last month that its full-year profits grew more than 580% from the prior year. \u201cEveryone\u2019s looking for something that looks and smells and tastes like Nvidia. \u2026 [Supermicro] is exactly that,\u201d said Victoria Bills, chief investment strategist at Banrion Capital Management. Supermicro has a market cap of roughly $63 billion, up from $5 billion just a year ago. The stock is set to join the benchmark S&P 500 index at its next quarterly rebalance. Wall Street thinks it has more room to run. Bank of America analysts initiated coverage on Supermicro last month with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating and price objective of $1,040, which the stock has already surpassed, closing at $1,124.70 a share on Wednesday. Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs analysts also recently initiated coverage. \u201cThe company\u2019s willingness to experiment with different combination of components, its close proximity to leading semiconductor companies in San Jose and the fact that a majority of its manufacturing is in the United States is a competitive advantage,\u201d wrote BofA analysts in a February 15 report. New York Community Bank gets $1 billion \u2018lifeline\u2019 Beleaguered regional lender New York Community Bank is receiving a more than $1 billion equity investment, reports my colleague Elisabeth Buchwald. The majority of the investment, $450 million, is coming from former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s firm, Liberty Strategic Capital. The remaining sum will come from Hudson Bay Capital, Reverence Capital Partners, Citadel Global Equities and \u201cother institutional investors and certain members of the Company\u2019s management,\u201d according to an announcement NYCB made Wednesday afternoon. The bank\u2019s stock plunged more than 40% earlier on Wednesday after The Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0that the bank was seeking a major cash infusion. After the deal was announced, the stock shot up 31% but those gains quickly leveled off. Ultimately, shares of NYCB closed 7% higher for the day after trades settled. The money \u201cprovides a lifeline,\u201d David Chiaverini, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, told CNN. In addition to the investment, NYCB announced Joseph Otting, a former comptroller of the currency, will replace Alessandro DiNello as CEO. DiNello, who was named CEO less than a week ago, will now become non-executive chairman. Read more here. Cash-strapped Britain cuts taxes for workers as election looms UK finance minister\u00a0Jeremy Hunt announced\u00a0a tax cut for workers Wednesday as he unveiled what is likely to be the government\u2019s last budget before a general election later this year, reports my colleague Hanna Ziady. Hunt cut\u00a0national insurance \u2014 a levy paid by people who work\u00a0\u2014 by two percentage points. That means an additional \u00a3450 ($572) a year for the average employee or \u00a3350 for someone who is self-employed. It\u2019s the second such cut in a matter of months. \u201cIf we want to encourage hard work, we should let people keep as much of their own money as possible,\u201d Hunt said. But soaring UK government debt, crumbling public services and a lackluster economy left\u00a0the chancellor with very little room for further substantial giveaways. The economy barely grew in 2023,\u00a0slipping into recession\u00a0at the end of the year in stark contrast with\u00a0Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s pledge to generate growth.

That, Boeing signaled Wednesday afternoon, is because there are no records. The records in question are documentation of steps on the assembly line last fall when National Transportation Safety Board investigators believe\u00a0Boeing employees removed critical bolts that hold the plug in place, but did not reinstall the bolts before the plane left the Boeing factory in October 2023.\u00a0The plane flew about 150 commercial flights before the door plug flew off the plane mid-flight on January 5, just over two months ago. \u201cBoeing has not provided us with the documents and information that we have requested numerous times over the past few months, specifically with respect to opening, closing and removal of the door and the team that does that work at the Renton facility,\u201d National Transportation Safety Board chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said Wednesday in testimony before the US Senate Commerce Committee. She testified that because of Boeing\u2019s actions, NTSB investigators do not know who on the Boeing assembly line removed and reinstalled the door plug that \u2014 months later while the plane was in service carrying passengers \u2014 blew out. After her testimony, Boeing followed up with a statement:\u00a0\u201cWith respect to documentation, if the door plug removal was undocumented there would be no documentation to share. We will continue to cooperate fully and transparently with the NTSB\u2019s investigation.\u201d The Federal Aviation Administration has recently identified issues with processes on Boeing\u2019s manufacturing line. Earlier this week, it said a six-week audit of the company identified \u201cnon-compliance issues in Boeing\u2019s manufacturing process control, parts handling and storage, and product control,\u201d although it did not specify the specific shortcomings. NTSB investigators have made multiple visits to Boeing facilities and created a special team to handle requesting and processing documents from Boeing and its key contractor, Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing said it has \u201cworked proactively and transparently to fully support the NTSB\u2019s investigation.\u201d \u201cOur team works tirelessly with the NTSB team to respond comprehensively to all NTSB information requests and bring information to them that would be relevant to their investigation,\u201d Boeing said. In particular, Homendy said, investigators are keen on identifying the actual Boeing employees who had their hands on the door plug bolts. \u201cThere is one team \u2013 one team \u2013\u00a0that deals with the doors,\u201d Homendy said.\u00a0The team includes 25 employees and a manager, and she called it \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201creally disappointing\u201d that NTSB still did not have names. Following her testimony, Boeing signaled that it was providing the requested list of names. \u201cEarly in the investigation, we provided the NTSB with names of Boeing employees, including door specialists, who we believed would have relevant information,\u201d Boeing said. \u201cWe have now provided the full list of individuals on the 737 door team, in response to a recent request.\u201d A source familiar with the request said the specific ask for those names was submitted to Boeing over the last weekend. Homendy also raised concerns with Spirit\u2019s approach to the probe, saying three individuals Spirit presented to the NTSB for interviews actually did not work for the company, and instead worked for a subcontractor.\u00a0Spirit has not commented on Homendy\u2019s comments.

A separate report launched prior to the door plug incident but released last month found \u201cgaps\u201d in Boeing\u2019s safety culture, including a disconnect between management and employees, and fears among employees about retaliation for reporting safety concerns. The FAA said the findings of both this audit and the separate report should be part of Boeing\u2019s quality improvement plan. It has given Boeing 90 days to produce the plan to fix its quality issues. Boeing said it is prepared to do what is needed to improve quality. \u201cWe have a clear picture of what needs to be done. Transparency prevailed in all of these discussions,\u201d said the company\u2019s statement. \u201cBoeing will develop the comprehensive action plan with measurable criteria that demonstrates the profound change that Administrator [Michael] Whitaker and the FAA demand. Our Boeing leadership team is totally committed to meeting this challenge.\u201d It is not the first such promise from Boeing since the Alaska Air incident. In January Boeing CEO David Calhoun conceded Boeing needed to improve its quality controls. \u201cWhatever final conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened,\u201d said Calhoun in comments to the company\u2019s investors in January. \u201cAn event like this must not happen on an airplane that leaves our factory. We simply must do better for our customers and their passengers.\u201d The audit also included major Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which builds the fuselages for the Boeing 737 Max 9 jet, among other items. Without giving details, the FAA said it found multiple instances where both companies allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements. Boeing used to own the operations that now make up most of Spirit, but spun it off as a separate company in 2005. Boeing disclosed on Friday that it is in negotiations to possibly re-acquire Spirit. Asked for a comment on the report, a Spirit spokesman replied, \u201cWe are in communication with Boeing and the FAA on appropriate corrective actions.\u201d More than two dozen FAA inspectors are taking part in the audit of Boeing\u2019s 737 plant in Renton, Washington, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker told members of Congress during a hearing last month. The agency is not the only government body looking into Boeing\u2019s quality issues. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident aboard the Alaska Air flight. A preliminary report on the incident found that the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place were missing when the jet left Boeing\u2019s factory last October to be delivered to Alaska Air. The NTSB has yet to assign blame for the missing bolts. In addition, the Justice Department is reviewing whether deficiencies found in the wake of the\u00a0door plug blowout\u00a0on a 737 Max flight last month violate a\u00a0deferred prosecution agreement\u00a0that Boeing signed with the government three years ago following two Max\u00a0fatal crashes,\u00a0according to a person familiar with the investigation. That probe could expose Boeing to criminal liability. The final results of this audit will likely be the backbone of future congressional hearings that could take Boeing to task. This Wednesday, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy will give the latest on the Alaska Flight 1282 investigation to the Senate committee that oversees aviation. The chair of the Senate Commerce Committee has said that hearings involving Boeing executives will take place after senators hear the latest investigative findings.

pulling out of its deal to purchase Spirit Airlines. The decision comes in the wake of a federal court ruling blocking the deal from taking place on antitrust grounds. The Justice Department had argued that airfares could go up if Spirit was no longer an independent airline. Spirit has been a leader in the segment of the airline industry that offers very low, no-frills base fares that required passengers to pay extra for everything, including carry-on baggage. JetBlue agreed to pay Spirit $69 million as part of its decision to end the deal, JetBlue said. While the companies had appealed the judge\u2019s ruling blocking the deal, JetBlue and Spirit both issued statements saying it had become clear they wouldn\u2019t be able to overcome the legal obstacles to complete the merger. \u201cGiven the hurdles to closing that remain, we decided together that both airlines\u2019 interests are better served by moving forward independently,\u201d said JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty. Spirit said it was always prepared to continue as an independent airline, given the regulatory challenges the deal faced. \u201cWe are disappointed we cannot move forward with a deal,\u201d Spirit CEO Ted Christie said. \u201cHowever, we remain confident in our future as a successful independent airline.\u201d The decision could spark a new bidding war for Spirit. There is even the possibility that it could lead to a bankruptcy filing and liquidation for Spirit, according to at least one airline analyst. Spirit has struggled with losses for several years as larger airlines have returned to profitability since demand for flying resumed after the height of the pandemic. JetBlue had signaled it might pull out of the deal in a January filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, shortly after the judge\u2019s decision. It has been clear for months that Spirit is no long worth the $3.8 billion, or $33.50 a share, that JetBlue agreed to pay for the airline. Even before federal Judge William Young issued the ruling blocking the deal, a decision that sent the price of Spirit shares plunging, its shares were trading at half the purchase price, or less, over course of the last six months, and only two-thirds of the price at the time the deal was agreed upon in July 2022. Shares of Spirit closed Friday at $6.46 a share, giving it a market cap of just over $700 million. Its shares are down 75% from the closing price the day the deal was originally announced, and they fell another 10% in premarket trading Monday on the news. Meanwhile shares of JetBlue rose 3% in premarket trading on news that the deal was off. Airline analysts from JPMorgan Chase believe that while JetBlue might still interested in expanding, it likely wanted to walk away from the $3.8 billion deal as originally crafted even before the judge\u2019s decision. \u201cWe believe JetBlue was wholly unprepared (or unwilling) to proceed with the originally-crafted deal economics (the price was simply just too much to pay),\u201d the JPMorgan analysts wrote in that note the day of the court decision. That section of the note had the headline \u201cJetBlue dodges a bullet.\u201d What Spirit means for fares on other airlines The US airline industry has gone through more than 20 years of mergers and consolidation before this deal was announced. The 10 major airlines that existed in 1999 have been combined into four major carriers \u2014 American Airlines, United, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines \u2014 through a series of deals, often done as part of a bankruptcy proceeding. Those four large carriers carry about 80% of the nation\u2019s air traffic. The mergers have resulted in a much more profitable US airline industry, but far fewer choices for US air travelers, which can result in higher fares. The Biden administration has taken a much more aggressive approach in fighting mergers and combinations, including in the airline industry. Besides successfully fighting this deal in court, it also objected to an alliance between JetBlue and American Airlines, an alliance that was dropped as JetBlue pursued this deal. Since the rise of Spirit, the four biggest US airlines \u2013 American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Airlines and United Airlines \u2013 have since created a class of seats on their planes that more closely mirrored Spirit\u2019s frill-free offering, a \u201cbasic economy\u201d seat. But they were also making a significant portion of their money by selling seats with a more premium service, including first class, business class, and economy-plus seats. But while its customers might have liked its fares, Spirit was regularly at or near the top in customer complaints about the service, according to Transportation Department reports. And with its fare structure and other issues, Spirit has found it difficult to return to profitability the way the larger carriers have. And if analysts who doubt Spirit\u2019s ability to survive prove to be correct, the end of this deal could lead to a closure of the airline and the loss of 13,000 jobs at Spirit, along with the higher fares that it sought to avoid by blocking the deal. Spirit reported an adjusted loss of $359.5 million in 2023, nearly double the $189.4 million it lost in 2022. Analysts forecast it will lose nearly $300 million more this year and $174 million in 2025. JetBlue has also been mired in losses since the pandemic as well, reporting an adjusted loss of $151 million in 2023, although that was an improvement from the $260 million it lost in 2022. Still, it faces its own challenges going forward, including activist investor Carl Icahn buying a 10% stake in the company and announcing plans to win two seats on its board of directors for his allies at the upcoming shareholders\u2019 meeting.

The Seattle resident booked with Alaska Airlines last March, purposefully selecting a flight with a plane he was happy to board \u2013 essentially, anything but a Boeing 737 Max. \u201cI got to the airport, checked again that it wasn\u2019t the Max. I went through security, got coffee. I walked onto the plane \u2013 I thought, it\u2019s kinda new,\u201d Pierson told CNN. \u201cThen I sat down and on the emergency card [in the seat pocket] it said it was a Max.\u201d He got up and walked off. \u201cA flight attendant was closing the front door. I said, \u2018I wasn\u2019t supposed to fly the Max.\u2019 She was like, \u2018What do you know about the Max?,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018I can\u2019t go into detail right now, but I wasn\u2019t planning on flying the Max, and I want to get off the plane.\u2019\u201d Pierson made it to New Jersey \u2013 after some back and forth, he said, Alaska\u2019s airport staff rebooked him onto a red-eye that evening on a different plane. Spending the whole day in the airport was worth it to avoid flying on the Max, he said. Pierson has a unique and first-hand perspective of the aircraft, made by Boeing at its Renton factory in the state of Washington. Now the executive director of airline watchdog group Foundation for Aviation Safety, he served as a squadron commanding officer among other leadership roles during a 30-year Naval career, followed by 10 years at Boeing \u2013 including three as a senior manager in production support at Renton itself, working on the 737 Max project before its launch. But he\u2019s one of a number of travelers who do not want to board the aircraft which has been at the heart of two fatal crashes, as well as the January 5 incident in which part of the fuselage of an Alaska Airlines plane blew out mid-air. The part \u2013 a door plug \u2013 was found to be missing four bolts that should have held it in place. Further reports of \u201cmany\u201d loose bolts and misdrilled holes have emerged from the subsequent investigations into the Max 9 model after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered the grounding of 171 Max 9 aircraft with the same door plug. Experts agree that the Alaska incident could have been worse, and the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has warned that \u201csomething like this can happen again.\u201d The previous model, the Max 8, was involved in two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed a total of 346 people. The crashes were widely attributed to the malfunctioning of MCAS, an automated system in the Max designed to stabilize the pitch of the plane, overriding pilot input in some circumstances. Boeing accepted its liability\u00a0in 2021 for one of the crashes. Weeks after the Alaska incident, Boeing CEO David Calhoun told investors on a quarterly call: \u201cWe will cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA at every turn\u2026 This increased scrutiny, whether it comes from us or a regulator or from third parties will make us better.\u201d \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cWhatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better.\u201d In February, in the wake of the Alaska incident, the company removed the head of the Max program\u00a0from his position and reshuffled other senior management figures. The move comes as critics have repeatedly said that the aircraft manufacturer is prioritizing profits over safety. The FAA is now \u201ctaking a holistic look at the quality control issues at Boeing to ensure safety is always the company\u2019s top priority,\u201d a spokesperson for the government agency told CNN. Representatives are on the ground assessing the production lines at Boeing\u2019s Renton factory and Spirit AeroSystems, whose Wichita, Kansas factory made the door plug that blew off mid-flight in the Alaska incident. On February 28, the FAA gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to address quality and safety issues. Boeing told CNN: \u201cEvery day, more than 80 airlines operate about 5,000 flights with the global fleet of 1,300 737 MAX airplanes, carrying 700,000 passengers to their destinations safely.\u00a0The 737 MAX family\u2019s in-service reliability is above 99% and consistent with other commercial airplane models.\u201d Of course, many thousands of people board Max aircraft with no concerns. But do other passengers care? It appears that enough do. Mixed impressions The last time the Max was grounded \u2013 for 20 months, following the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 on a Max 8 in March 2019 \u2013 25% of the 1,005 Americans questioned in a Reuters/Ipsos poll\u00a0said that they had \u201cnot a lot\u201d or \u201cno\u201d confidence in the aircraft \u2013 compared to 31% who did, and 44% who were unsure. The poll was taken in December 2020, shortly before the aircraft\u2019s return to the skies. After being \u201ctold about the aircraft\u2019s safety issues,\u201d a further 57% said they would be somewhat unlikely or not likely to fly in a Max, according to the report. Nearly half \u2013 45% \u2013 said that they would still be somewhat unlikely or not very likely to fly in it after it had been back in the air for six months. And 31% of all respondents said that they had little to no confidence that the Federation Aviation Administration (FAA) \u201cputs passenger and crew safety first when determining whether an aircraft is fit to fly.\u201d Most countries cleared the Max 8 to fly again by 2021, but three years on, there still appears to be negative public opinion about the Max. \u201cIt\u2019s unsettling that there have been so many issues with this specific type of plane,\u201d Stephanie King, a passenger on the affected Alaska Airlines flight, told CNN in January. \u201cI hope something is done so that this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Then there\u2019s flight booking site Kayak, which has seen usage of its filter to deselect Max aircraft (models 8 and 9) during the booking process increase 15-fold since January, the company told CNN. The site introduced the filter in March 2019, after the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Doubts have also remained across the industry as a whole. Following the Alaska incident, a February AP-Norc poll\u00a0regarding air travel safety found nearly a third of Americans surveyed answered \u201cnot at all\u201d or \u201ca little\u201d when asked if they believe that airplanes are safe from structural faults. While planes were generally viewed to be as safe as cars or trains for means of transportation, fewer than two in 10 surveyed strongly agreed that planes are fault-free. If it\u2019s Boeing, \u2018I ain\u2019t going\u2019 Bel\u00e9n Estacio has boycotted the Max since the January incident. Shortly after the Alaska Airlines fuselage blowout, she was scheduled on a Max for a work flight. \u201cMy boyfriend didn\u2019t want me to fly on it so I changed my travel plans to make sure I wasn\u2019t flying on any type of Max,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter which model, I don\u2019t want to fly them.\u201d To her, she said, \u201cThe Alaska incident was further confirmation that Boeing is still not being thorough and not fixing its issues.\u201d Florida-based Estacio, who works in marketing, now checks the aircraft type before booking any flight. She\u2019s made two trips since January. \u201cThe whole thing of, \u2018If it\u2019s not Boeing I ain\u2019t going,\u2019 it\u2019s totally the opposite now,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very happy when I\u2019ve seen I\u2019ll be flying an Airbus.\u201d She says she\u2019s not the only one in her circle, and says she knows people employing both \u201csoft\u201d and \u201chard\u201d boycotts. \u201cSome say, \u2018Absolutely not,\u2019 others say, \u2018If I can change it, I will; if not I\u2019ll just go on it.\u2019\u201d \u2018Not an aircraft I\u2019d want to fly\u2019 UK-based communications consultant Elayne Grimes is another with a personal boycott. Grimes, who travels regularly for work, was worried following the Max 8\u2019s first crash\u00a0in October 2018: Lion Air flight 610, in Indonesia, which killed all 189 onboard a plane in service for less than three months. Grimes \u2013 who\u2019d previously worked in emergency crisis management \u2013 was immediately concerned about Boeing\u2019s new aircraft, which had launched to great fanfare in 2017. \u201cI actively sought out airlines that didn\u2019t have the Max,\u201d she said. When Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed in March 2019, killing another 157 people, it confirmed her resolve. In 2022, Grimes watched \u201cDownfall: The Case Against Boeing,\u201d a Netflix documentary directed by Rory Kennedy, which looked at the two tragedies and flagged concerns about the working environment at Boeing. \u201cI watched that and thought [Boeing] was an organization putting profit before people, and thought, \u2018That\u2019s not for me.\u2019 I don\u2019t see myself flying one in the near future,\u201d she said. While the FAA has cleared the Max to fly once more, Grimes believes that \u201cits issues are not resolved.\u201d \u201cWhen the door came off and they called [the planes] in and found other aircraft with issues, I thought \u2018Hmm,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not an aircraft I\u2019d want to fly.\u201d Grimes is a self-declared \u201cavgeek,\u201d or aviation fanatic \u2013 and she\u2019s not the only one monitoring the industry closely to have reservations. Elliot Sharod, who says he took 78 flights last year, is on the fence. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t exactly refuse to fly it, but I\u2019d ideally fly an Airbus if given the choice,\u201d he said. A former aviation journalist, who wished to remain anonymous for professional reasons, says they lost trust after the second crash. \u201cAfter the first one, the predominant talking points were, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s got to be pilot error, or the weather \u2013 it can\u2019t be the plane,\u201d they say. \u201cIt was Boeing. I believed that everything coming out of Boeing had been tested and retested \u2013 it had to be something else. \u201cThen the Ethiopian crash happened, and there was a bit of the same messaging, but finally it came out that actually it was\u00a0the plane. I lost all trust at that point in the Max.\u201d They say they still love flying the \u201colder style of Boeings \u2013 the 777s and the original 737s.\u201d \u201cThey were all designed back in the days when engineers ruled Boeing,\u201d they say. \u201cI feel I can trust them more than the Max.\u201d \u2018Piss poor design\u2019 \u201cWould you put your family on a Max simulator trained aircraft? I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d They sound like the words of an anxious passenger in 2024. In fact, they were written by one Boeing employee to another in February 2018 \u2013 eight months before the Lion Air crash. (In the internal communications, their co-worker replied, simply, \u201cNo.\u201d) In April 2017, in internal messages by Boeing employees working on the soon-to-be-released Max, another employee wrote, \u201cThis airplane is designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.\u201d The same exchange included a reference to the aircraft\u2019s \u201cpiss poor design.\u201d A design tweak was labelled as \u201cpatching the leaky boat.\u201d These internal communications\u00a0were released as part of the 18-month investigation into the Max by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In a 238-page report, released in September 2020, the committee outlined\u00a0\u201cthe serious flaws and missteps in the design, development, and certification of the aircraft.\u201d The report highlighted five key themes, including \u201cproduction pressures that jeopardized the safety of the flying public\u201d and a \u201cculture of concealment\u201d at Boeing. At the time, Boeing said that the communications \u201cdo not reflect the company we are and need to be, and they are completely unacceptable.\u201d The company issued a statement\u00a0acknowledging the committee\u2019s findings and saying that the victims of the crashes were \u201cin our thoughts and prayers.\u201d Boeing said that when the Max 8 returned to service it would be \u201cone of the most thoroughly scrutinized aircraft in history, and we have full confidence in its safety.\u201d It added: \u201cWe have been hard at work strengthening our safety culture and rebuilding trust with our customers, regulators, and the flying public\u2026 We have made fundamental changes to our company\u2026 and continue to look for ways to improve.\u201d The House Committee report also included concerns about the FAA and its \u201cgrossly insufficient oversight\u201d over Boeing during the Max design process and in the period between the two crashes. The report\u00a0said that \u201cgaps in the regulatory system at the FAA\u2026 allowed this fatally flawed plane into service.\u201d A spokesperson for the FAA told CNN: \u201cThe FAA made significant improvements to its delegation and aircraft certification processes in recent years and took immediate action following the Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines door plug incident to address concerns about the quality of aircraft that Boeing\u00a0and its suppliers produce.\u201d \u2018Vindicated\u2019 after safety failure Rory Kennedy followed the investigation from start to finish. The director of \u201cDownfall\u201d told CNN she didn\u2019t have a \u201cstrong opinion\u201d on the plane until she started making the documentary in early 2020. But, she said, \u201cI was shocked by what we discovered\u2026 [it] was really disturbing.\u201d Her film is a forensic investigation of the two crashes. \u201cDownfall\u201d interviews ex-Boeing staff and concerned pilots, who paint a picture of an accident waiting to happen. It follows the congressional hearings held as part of the House investigation, and interviews the victims\u2019 families. Kennedy says that during the design process Boeing \u201cwent to great pains to hide [MCAS] and how powerful it was.\u201d The stabilizing system was designed specifically for the Max, since the fuel-efficient engines being added to the 1960s-designed plane affected the trim. The House committee found that Boeing concealed its existence from the FAA, airlines and pilots. Additionally, after the Lion Air crash, FAA analysis in December 2018 predicted that without a software fix, a Max could crash on average once every two years\u00a0over the course of its usage. Yet the plane was not grounded at the time. \u201cBoeing and FAA both gambled with public safety,\u201d\u00a0House committee chair Peter DeFazio said in a 2020 statement. \u201cWe are already undertaking important initiatives based on what we have learned\u2026 these initiatives are focused on advancing overall aviation safety by improving our organization, process and culture,\u201d the FAA said in a statement\u00a0following the committee\u2019s report. \u201c[They] decided to keep the plane in the air, to save money and try to have a fix before the next plane crashed,\u201d said Kennedy. \u201cI interviewed [family members of the victims] as they were understanding that they knew this. Can you imagine?\u201d \u201cI would absolutely not fly that plane,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI\u2019ve not noticed the culture of Boeing has shifted from one that prioritizes finances over safety.\u201d She says that one of the factors that pushed her to make the documentary, was \u201ctalking to pilots who were telling me, \u2018Absolutely don\u2019t get on that plane.\u2019\u201d And while she initially received pushback about the film, including from family and friends, \u201cWhen the door ripped off the airplane, people said, \u2018You\u2019re so vindicated.\u2019\u201d Her research also highlighted production issues in the 787 Dreamliner \u2013 Boeing\u2019s flagship long-haul aircraft, which debuted in 2011. As a result, she avoids that, too \u2013 and suggests that instead of confining their investigations to individual planes, the FAA and NTSB should be investigating Boeing as a whole. A spokesperson for the FAA said that it has blocked production expansion of the Max, and \u201cis conducting enhanced oversight of Boeing and its suppliers. The agency is examining all aspects of Boeing\u2019s three manufacturing lines and Spirit AeroSystems\u2019 supplier activities. A dedicated team of approximately two dozen aviation safety inspectors is conducting these reviews at the Boeing 737 MAX facility in Renton, Washington, and at Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas.\u201d Kennedy wants a \u201cproper hearing\u201d in Congress \u2013 similar to the one that investigated the Max crashes. \u201cTo me, what you really need is an investigation into the culture of Boeing, what\u2019s happening at board level, and what kind of decisions are being made to continue to prioritize financial interests over the safety of consumers,\u201d she says. \u2018Their numbers game cost me my friend\u2019 Critics say that Boeing\u2019s 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas saw the culture change\u00a0from one that emphasized engineering prowess to one intent on watching the bottom line. Damning its \u201cbroken safety culture,\u201d DeFazio said after the 2020 investigation that \u201cBoeing \u2013 under pressure to compete with Airbus and deliver profits for Wall Street \u2013 escaped scrutiny from the FAA, withheld critical information from pilots, and ultimately put planes into service that killed 346 innocent people.\u201d In 2021, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle criminal charges that the company defrauded the FAA when the Max was first certified. \u201cThe reason that [Boeing\u2019s] culture is so damaging is because they are in a numbers game, and they want to make as much profit as possible at any cost. And for me, that cost me my friend,\u201d says Deveney Williams. In March 2019, Williams\u2019 friend, Samya Stumo, was onboard the Ethiopian Airlines flight. The pair had been due to move into an apartment together in Washington, D.C. \u201cI avoid Boeing as much as possible \u2013 I try to get on an Airbus even if it costs more or is a different route,\u201d said Williams. \u201cI never knew about plane models prior to this, but I\u2019ve educated myself onto how to see the model when buying a ticket. I\u2019ve got friends who ask how they can switch flights, or figure out how to avoid flying on this. I\u2019ve learned a lot \u2013 I don\u2019t want this happening to anyone else.\u201d For Williams, the Alaska incident was a \u201cweird relief\u201d \u2013 because it happened in the US. The aspersions that were cast on the pilots of the two crashes didn\u2019t happen in January. \u201cThis time, it\u2019s on American soil, I\u2019m presuming it was an American pilot \u2013 so they don\u2019t have any other fingers to point.\u201d \u2018Airlines don\u2019t make it easy to switch\u2019 Torleif Stumo \u2013 Samya\u2019s brother \u2013 had a similar incident to Ed Pierson, in which he says his plane was switched to a Max at the last moment. Like Pierson, he only noticed when he saw the safety card in the seat pocket of his flight from Panama City to Bogot\u00e1 in August 2023. \u201cI don\u2019t really have anxiety, I\u2019ve never had panic attacks but that was one of the closest times I ever came,\u201d he says. \u201cThe crew were amazing. They had disconnected from the jetway and initially offered to change my seat to first class. But then I told them why I wanted to get off. They immediately understood and brought the plane back [to the gate].\u201d Stumo ended up spending the night at an airport hotel. The airline he was traveling with agreed to rebook him fee-free having listened to a phone call he\u2019d made to customer services when originally buying the ticket. In it, he\u2019d been assured that he wouldn\u2019t be on a Max. Williams and Kennedy both say they\u2019ve had similar experiences with their aircraft switched to a Max at the last minute. Stumo believes that it\u2019s not easy enough for consumers to tell whether they\u2019ve been booked onto a Max. Michael Stumo, Samya and Torleif\u2019s father, wants aircraft types to be \u201cprominently displayed\u201d during the booking process, he tells CNN. Following the January 5 incident, Alaska and United \u2013 the US carriers which use the Max 9 \u2013 issued waivers allowing passengers unwilling to fly the Max flexibility. These have now expired, but Alaska told CNN that concerned passengers can be rebooked onto a different aircraft for free, by calling reservations. \u201cWe have complete confidence in the safety of all our aircraft,\u201d they added. A spokesperson for United said the airline \u201chas no change fees on most tickets. We\u2019re happy to work with customers with concerns to find a solution that works for them.\u201d Pierson\u2019s Foundation for Aviation Safety \u2013 established in 2023 as a watchdog for both the aviation industry and the government entities that regulate it \u2013 added a page to their website in February\u00a0for passengers reluctant to fly on the plane. It explains how to check the plane assigned for one\u2019s flight before booking, refusing to board, and rebooking at the airport. Pierson says the foundation gets many requests from the public asking whether it\u2019s safe to fly the Max. The former Boeing employee has been critical of Boeing company since the aircraft was first on the production line. Over the summer of 2018, he sent several messages up the chain at Boeing, having noticed what he now says was an \u201cunstable production line.\u201d In emails which he has since shared publicly, Pierson warned of his concerns that the intense pressure to get planes out of the factory was leading exhausted workers to cut corners. He feared that it could end in tragedy, he wrote. Having taken early retirement in August 2018 \u2013 \u201cI knew it was an unhealthy working environment and couldn\u2019t support the leadership anymore,\u201d he told CNN \u2013 he wrote again to the board of Boeing, as well as to the FAA, after the Lion Air crash, and then again after the Ethiopian Airlines crash. He later testified at the congressional hearing. \u201cI would definitely not fly that plane,\u201d he says now. \u201cThe same problems that I saw in 2017 and 2018 have not been resolved. The factory is still putting huge amounts of pressure on employees that build the planes, and they\u2019ve had many production quality defects that just came to light.\u201d \u2018We want no third crash\u2019 Although the Max is flying once more, its future appears to be up in the air. The FAA has capped production of new aircraft, and launched an investigation \u201cinto whether Boeing failed to maintain their quality system in accordance with federal regulations.\u201d It has also launched an analysis of \u201cpotential safety-focused reforms around quality control,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. As part of its \u201cenhanced oversight,\u201d FAA teams are reviewing Boeing\u2019s Max production system, and Spirit AeroSystems\u2019 production system for the aircraft\u2019s fuselage. It is also reviewing employee training and qualifications, increasing its onsite presence at Max manufacturing facilities, and looking at \u201chow Boeing transfers unfinished work from suppliers to its production lines,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. Meanwhile, the NTSB\u2019s investigation into what happened on Alaska Airlines flight 1282 continues. A preliminary NTSB report does not lay blame on Boeing nor find a probable cause, which is typically included in the NTSB\u2019s final report which could take a year or more. Spirit said following the incident it was cooperating with the NTSB and added, \u201cas a company, we remain focused on the quality of each aircraft structure that leaves our facilities.\u201d For Michael Stumo, the Alaska incident proved his fears. \u201cWe have nine years of [Boeing] getting caught, promising to do better, and they don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have this: where they can\u2019t even put plug doors in a plane, can\u2019t fix bolts.\u201d Stumo wants Boeing to \u201cbring in people who know how to do complex manufacturing processes.\u201d \u201cThese people exist. Boeing has a lot of money. Hire them,\u201d he said. A Boeing spokesperson said the company has \u201cinvested heavily in our workforce over the last several years.\u201d Engineering staff are up by 10% and manufacturing by 11%, they said, while they have \u201cincreased the number of Commercial Airplanes quality inspectors by 20%, and have said we will continue to hire.\u201d \u201cWe have also invested in quality across the company, growing the number of quality employees by more than 25%, exceeding 2019 pre-pandemic levels,\u201d they added. Stumo says the company needs urgent change. \u201cThe first crash shouldn\u2019t have happened. The second they had full knowledge of [the MCAS malfunctioning] \u2013 it absolutely shouldn\u2019t have happened. \u201cWe want no third crash. And we want Boeing transformed back into the superior aviation engineering company making amazing and safe products that it was.\u201d", "articleSection": ["travel", "aviation"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Buckley", "url": ""}], "dateModified": "2024-03-04T15:54:52.026Z", "description": "The Boeing 737 Max is under scrutiny for safety flaws that have come to light following the Alaska Airlines incident.

Negotiations were first reported earlier Friday by the Wall Street Journal and Seattle Times. Spirit shares soared 15% in trading Friday on the reports. But shares had been down 10% from the time of the Alaska Air incident in early January through Thursday\u2019s close, and down 70% since a March 2019 fatal crash of a Boeing 737 Max , which led to a 20-month grounding of the jet. Boeing sold Spirit in 2005, receiving $900 million in cash for the sale. Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems makes major parts of several Boeing models, including the fuselages for the 737 Max. The parts are then shipped to Boeing\u2019s factory in Washington state via rail. \u201cWe believe that the reintegration of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems\u2019 manufacturing operations would further strengthen aviation safety, improve quality and serve the interests of our customers, employees, and shareholders,\u201d Boeing said in a statement late Friday. \u201dAlthough there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement, we are committed to finding ways to continue to improve the safety and quality of the airplanes on which millions of people depend each and every day.\u201d Spirit has had its own series of quality control issues in recent years. The problems had become serious enough that Boeing had agreed to give it more money to try to improve Spirit\u2019s quality and reliability issues there hurting Boeing\u2019s own output. The payments came to an extra $60 million in revenue last year and $395 million in 2024 and 2025. Those payments are an indication of Boeing\u2019s motivation for a deal for Spirit. It can\u2019t return to profitability itself unless problems at Spirit are also fixed. And it\u2019s going to cost Boeing money to fix those problems, whether it is the largest customer, or the owner, of those operations. About $3.9 billion of Spirit AeroSystems\u2019 revenue last year came from Boeing, making up about 64% of its overall revenue. Boeing rival Airbus is Spirit\u2019s second largest customer. It is unlikely that Boeing would be able hold onto that part of the business were it to reacquire Spirit. Spirit\u2019s market cap at the close of trading Friday, after shares had been lifted by the reports of a possible deal, stood at $3.7 billion, or just slightly less than what Boeing paid Spirit last year as its major supplier. But after five years of net losses totaling $31.5 billion, Boeing ended 2023 with only $12.7 billion on its balance sheet, down from $14.6 billion the year before. An initial report from the National Transportation Safety Board on the January incident with the door plug blowing out aboard the Alaska Air flight found that the jet had left Boeing\u2019s factory in October with four bolts missing that were needed to keep it in place. But the reason that the door plug, and the missing bolts, were removed by Boeing was that the fuselage arrived at Boeing\u2019s factory with problems with five rivets that had been done by Spirit AeroSystems. So even if Boeing was ultimately responsible for the problem, quality issues at Spirit may have also played a part. The NTSB has yet to assess blame for the incident. But the bolts have been just one of a series of quality issues at Spirit AeroSystems in recent years. Fuselages have been delivered to Boeing with work still needing to be done on them, which caused what is known as \u201cout-of-sequence\u201d work, which may have caused some of Boeing\u2019s own quality issues. In 2023 it used a \u201cnon-standard manufacturing process\u201d when joining parts of the fuselages, causing a halt in deliveries of 737 Max jets. And just a month ago, a Spirit employee notified Boeing that two holes may not have been drilled exactly to Boeing\u2019s requirements, which required Boeing to rework about 50 planes that had not yet been delivered.

The issues involve engine anti-ice systems on the 737 Max and larger 787 Dreamliner. While the FAA flagged the issues in a filing in mid-February, it\u00a0drew greater attention on Friday because of a Seattle Times article. The safety regulator continues to allow both models of the plane to fly despite the potential problems. Both issues are moving through the FAA\u2019s standard process for developing airworthiness directives \u2014 rather than an emergency process \u2014 signaling that the agency and plane maker do not believe the issues are serious enough to require the planes to stop flying immediately. Boeing issued a statement saying neither issue is \u201can immediate safety-of-flight concern based on extensive engineering analysis.\u201d \u201cOur extensive efforts to further improve airplane safety include systematically reviewing issues,\u201d the company said. But another safety issue is the last thing that Boeing needs at this moment, two months after a door plug on a 737 Max blew out on an Alaska Air flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet shortly after take-off. The Max has had a series of problems over the last five years, including two fatal crashes that between them killed 346 people in late 2018 and early 2019, which led to a 20-month grounding of the jet. The importance of de-icing While it might seem as if de-icing equipment is less important in summer months, the cold temperatures at high altitudes at which commercial jets fly, combined with the amount of moisture in clouds that they must fly through, make the de-icing equipment necessary twelve months a year. \u201cYou\u2019re not protected by Mother Nature\u2019s seasons,\u201d said Dennis Tajer, an American Airlines pilot and a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association. \u201cAirworthiness directives aren\u2019t issued unless you have an unsafe condition that need to be addressed. It\u2019s ominous. It may be manageable on a temporary basis. But it\u2019s not a solution.\u201d The FAA said the newly disclosed Max issue could cause the jet\u2019s engines to stop working.\u00a0An electrical issue \u201ccould result in loss of thrust on both engines due to damage from operation in icing conditions.\u201d\u00a0The fix includes replacing wiring in a panel above the pilots\u2019 heads. The issue was discovered during a Boeing engineering analysis three years ago and is \u201ca remote concern that has never been seen during decades of service\u201d in both the current and previous generations of 737, said Jessica Kowal, a Boeing spokeswoman.\u00a0The company said it disclosed the issue to airlines and the FAA at the time, and provided a fix. The 2021 discovery lines up with the company\u2019s order that year to ground some Max planes because of a different electrical problem.\u00a0The Boeing Max \u2014 at the time, only recently back in service after the nearly two-year grounding prompted by two fatal crashes \u2014 underwent an extensive electrical system analysis. A different issue with the Dreamliner Less than a week after publicly publishing the 737 Max notice, the FAA reported a separate anti-icing issue with the 787 Dreamliner.\u00a0It said a damaged seal could cause heat damage to an engine inlet \u2014 and risk serious damage to the plane. In 2018, an outer covering of an engine cowling that broke loose on an earlier version of a 737 jet shattered a window on a Southwest Airlines flight. The passenger sitting next to that window, Jennifer Riordan, 43, was expelled through the broken window. While other passengers were able to bring her back inside, she died as a result of blunt impact trauma of the head, neck and torso. Boeing is working on redesigning the part on the 787 Dreamliner engine to prevent further issues, Kowal said.\u00a0The issue was discovered on fewer than two dozen of over 1,000 Dreamliners in service, she said. The FAA described neither issue as a production quality problem \u2014 which is its current focus at Boeing following the January in-flight blowout. The FAA orders have not yet taken effect, but said they would apply to about 315 planes, including both Maxes and Dreamliners. Series of safety and quality questions Boeing drew criticism from lawmakers after the January 737 Max mid-flight blowout for having asked the FAA to certify new models of the 737 Max despite a different flaw in the anti-ice system.\u00a0The company ultimately withdrew that request, which will delay its plans to deliver the new planes to its airline customers. But it continues to build existing models of the jet with the same engine de-icing flaw that is delaying certification of the next Max versions. In addition to the de-icing equipment issue, Boeing has been stung by numerous questions about the quality and safety procedures at its factories. The National Transportation Safety Board is looking into the causes of the incident and already found that four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place were\u00a0missing when the plane left a Boeing factory\u00a0in October. The FAA is also demanding that Boeing come up with a\u00a0plan to improve its quality controls\u00a0for its aircraft manufacturing. And the\u00a0Justice Department is investigating\u00a0whether the incident is a violation of a settlement it reached in 2021 to defer prosecution on charges that it\u00a0defrauded the FAA\u00a0during the\u00a0original certification\u00a0of the 737 Max before\u00a0two fatal crashes\u00a0resulted in a\u00a020-month grounding\u00a0of the plane. The NTSB has yet to determine blame or fault for the door plug incident on the Alaska Air flight. That will come later in its investigation, perhaps a year or more from now. But Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told investors in January, \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that.

The complaint charges that three Boeing employees in China downloaded data 25 times between 2013 and 2017 related to three different models of fighter jets, an airborne warning and control system, an attack helicopter and two varieties of air-to-ground missiles. In addition, Boeing disclosed that there were also 80 additional unauthorized downloads of defense data and information that was required to be protected by its employees and contractors in 18 countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Morocco, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, Taiwan, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. The State Department found a total of 199 violations of the Arms Export Control Act by Boeing. It said all of the alleged violations were voluntarily disclosed and a considerable majority predate 2020, after which Boeing \u201cincorporated numerous improvements to its compliance program.\u201d \u201cHad the Department not taken into consideration these mitigating factors, it would have charged Respondent with additional violations or proposed a higher penalty,\u201d said the statement from the agency to Boeing. The department said that $24 million of the fine will be suspended as long as that money is used to strengthen Boeing\u2019s compliance program further. The company will also be subject to the oversight of a special compliance officer for at least the next two years. \u201cWe are committed to our trade controls obligations, and we look forward to working with the State Department under the agreement announced today,\u201d said the statement from Boeing. \u201cWe are committed to continuous improvement of that program, and the compliance undertakings reflected in this agreement will help us advance that objective.\u201d Besides its commercial aircraft business, Boeing is a major defense contractor, with revenue of $24.9 billion last year. That compares to revenue of $33.9 billion from its commercial jet sales. This settlement is just the latest blow to Boeing\u2019s once-stellar reputation. It faces multiple investigations for a door plug blowing out on a 737 Max flight in January, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the Alaska Airlines flight. The National Safety Transportation Board is looking into the causes of the incident and already found that four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place were missing when the plane left a Boeing factory in October. The Federal Aviation Administration is also demanding that Boeing come up with a plan to improve its quality controls for its aircraft manufacturing. And the Justice Department is investigating whether the incident is a violation of a settlement it reached in 2021 to defer prosecution on charges that it defrauded the FAA during the original certification of the 737 Max before two fatal crashes that killed all 346 people aboard the flights resulted in a 20-month grounding of the plane. The NTSB has yet to determine blame or fault for the door plug incident on the Alaska Air flight. That will come later in its investigation, perhaps a year or more from now.

However, commercial airplanes remain the safest form of travel and a new report released February 28 confirms that 2023 was, by several measures, the safest year ever for flying. Now in its 60th year, the IATA Annual Safety Report - compiled by the International Air Transport Association - has been tracking the evolution of commercial aviation safety since 1964. Its data recorded 37 million flights in 2023 (both jet and turboprop), an increase of 17% on the year before. But despite this, 2023 had the lowest fatality risk and \u201call accident\u201d rate on record. \u201cAt this level of safety, on average a person would have to travel by air every day for 103,239 years to experience a fatal accident,\u201d says the IATA report. There were no fatal accidents or hull losses involving passenger jet aircraft last year, but the tragedy of Yeti Airlines Flight 691, a turboprop plane that crashed in Nepal in January with the loss of 72 lives, confirms that we can never take safety for granted. The industry must always strive to improve. \u201cThis is what we have done throughout our history. And we will continue to make flying ever safer,\u201d said Willie Walsh, IATA\u2019s Director General. Regional breakdown The 2023 \u201call accident\u201d rate was better than the year before in all regions except North America and Asia Pacific. There were a number of close calls on US runways in 2023, with seven runway incursions \u2013 when planes get in the way of one another on the runway \u2013 recorded by mid-March alone. Europe has maintained a fatality risk of zero since 2018. However, the biggest chunk of the non-fatal airplane incidents in the region were related to landing gear collapse. Says the IATA: \u201cChallenges persist in the critical phases of flight, especially during landing and take-off, with over half of all accidents occurring during 2014-2023 occurring during these phases.\u201d Africa had the highest accident rate with 6.38 accidents per million sectors in 2023, although that\u2019s improving on the year before and there haven\u2019t been any fatal accidents in the region since 2020. North Asia was the safest region in the world. Its accident rate dropped from 0.45 accidents per million sectors down to 0.00 in 2023, while the fatality risk dropped from 0.23 in 2022 in 0.00 in 2023. The collision at Tokyo Haneda in January 2024 will impact North Asia\u2019s safety performance for this year, although the Japan Airlines crew were praised for their excellent execution of safety protocol, which prevented this particular disaster turning into a much greater tragedy.

Justice is reviewing whether deficiencies found in the wake the door plug blowout on a 737 Max flight last month violate a deferred prosecution agreement that Boeing signed with the government three years ago following two Max fatal crashes,\u00a0according to a person familiar with the investigation. Prosecutors are looking at whether the latest troubles at Boeing are covered under the previous deal under which Boeing paid $2.5 billion to settle allegations that Boeing defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the initial certification process for the 737 Max. The investigation was first reported by\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0and\u00a0Bloomberg. The reported probe adds to a lengthy list of investigations into Boeing\u2019s actions after part of an Alaska Airlines flight blew off the side of the plane on January 5. No one was seriously injured. The Justice review could expose Boeing to broader criminal liability if officials decide Boeing may have violated a controversial legal agreement that was due to expire on\u00a0January 7,\u00a0two days\u00a0after the door plug incident. It was not immediately clear what part of the agreement Boeing may have violated. Boeing said it had no comment on the reports of the Justice investigation. Families of passengers who died in the 2018 and 2019 crashes of 737 Maxes \u2013 the crashes that led to the deferred prosecution agreement \u2013 tried to overturn the agreement, saying a federal victims law should have given them a say.\u00a0 In the days after the door plug incident on Alaska Airlines flight 1282, an attorney for the families asked the Justice Department to review whether Boeing violated the agreement. The agreement cost Boeing $2.5 billion in 2021, but most of that money \u2013 $1.77 billion \u2013 went to compensate the company\u2019s airline customers, money it had already agreed to pay for the 20-month grounding of the jets following the crashes. It also included a $243.6 million criminal fine and a $500 million to fund a compensation for family members of the crash victims. Boeing is subject to several other investigations stemming from the door plug incident. The FAA last month informed Boeing it is probing whether the company failed to ensure its planes \u201cconformed to its approved design\u201d and that they were in compliance with FAA safety regulations. The FAA is also completing an audit of Boeing\u2019s manufacturing processes and a survey of Boeing\u2019s employees. Wednesday the agency gave Boeing 90 days to produce a plan to fix serious quality and safety issues. The National Transportation Safety Board continues to investigate the door plug incident and recently reported that critical bolts that hold the door plug in place were not installed in Boeing\u2019s factory. The NTSB has yet to determine blame or fault for the door plug incident on the Alaska Air flight. That will come later in its investigation, perhaps a year or more from now.

This brand new \u201cgreenfield\u201d airport some 20 miles southwest of downtown Dubai was designed to become, in a not-so-distant future, the world\u2019s largest and busiest. The vision was \u2013 and still is \u2013 for a futuristic mega-hub, ensuring that the emirate\u2019s role as a major node of the global economy doesn\u2019t run into capacity problems anytime soon. Dubai Airports, the airport authority that manages both Dubai International (DXB) and the new airport, promises that when Al Maktoum International is finished, it\u2018ll be able to handle more than 160 million passengers per year as well as 12 million tonnes of freight. To put that in perspective, that\u2019s nearly 63 million more travelers than the world\u2019s current busiest airport, Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International, handled in 2022 and nearly 100 million more than Dubai International.\u00a0DXB, let\u2019s not forget, is already the world\u2019s busiest airport outside of the US and Dubai\u2019s main international gateway. However, a decade and a pandemic after that initial passenger flight, and a full 13 years since it first opened for cargo operations, Dubai\u2019s newest airport is still very much a work in progress. DWC has found a role as a center for aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul \u2013 \u201cMRO\u201d in industry parlance. It also hosts a number of air cargo operators (including Emirates Cargo, the freight subsidiary of the UAE flag carrier) and handles executive jets and some charter flights. Scheduled passenger services, however, are limited to those provided by a handful of low-cost carriers that operate services mostly to Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia. So what\u2019s been happening with those ambitious plans? And when might we see a timeline or new designs? \u2018Airport of the future\u2019 The recent Dubai Air Show, held at a purpose-built venue at Al Maktoum International Airport in 2023, offered some intriguing hints about what\u2019s ahead for DWC \u2013 and some insights into Dubai Airports\u2019 long-term strategy. \u201cWe have prioritized expansion and investments at DXB to meet our customers\u2019 requirements and plans,\u201d Paul Griffiths, Dubai Airports CEO, tells CNN. \u201cThis will continue until all possible capacity is absorbed.\u201d The plan is to maximize current capacity through \u201cthe application of innovative technology and refurbishments to rethink the use of space,\u201d says Griffiths, adding another 20 million passengers to DXB\u2019s current annual capacity of 100 million passengers. \u201cThis expansion will not only accommodate near-term growth but also provide us with additional time to strategize for the phased expansion of DWC. Our passenger forecasts for 2023 stand at 86.8 million, with projections of 88.2 million and 93.8 million for 2024 and 2025, respectively,\u201d he adds. Griffiths has been careful not to confirm a timeline, but in November 2023 he told the AFP news agency that when capacity is reached \u201cwe are going to need a new airport [\u2026] That is going to have to happen at some stage during the 2030s.\u201d \u201cDWC is a thrilling prospect,\u201d Griffiths told CNN in January this year. \u201cThe future Phase 2 development represents a significant opportunity, allowing us to build from the ground up in alignment with Dubai\u2019s broader goals and growth plans.\u201d Griffiths told reporters at the air show that designs are already being produced for the new mega-airport, but the massive, three-dimensional scale model displayed at the event, with its six parallel runways and three gigantic terminals, is already some years outdated. Changing the business model However, Griffiths has hinted to Business Traveller magazine about an intriguing modular approach to gradually expand DWC on a timeline that might run into the 2050s. \u201cWe are not planning an airport that has terminals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to completely change the business model for airports, make them actually far more intimate, and get rid of all the legacy processes that we\u2019ve had to subject our customers to, for far too long.\u201d The airport will be the centerpiece of a much larger scheme, called Dubai South, that envisages the creation of a whole new city in a 145-square-kilometer stretch of desert just south of Dubai. This entire new district, of which some pieces are already starting to take shape, will have eight neighborhoods each allocated to a specific industry or activity, with a mix of residential and commercial areas as well. With the airport at the heart of the action, it will form a complete \u201caerotropolis\u201d. The Mohammed bin Rashid (MBR) Aerospace Hub, which will host Dubai\u2019s burgeoning aviation and aerospace industrial ecosystem, including the recently announced $950 million Emirates engineering center, will be playing a very prominent role in this vision. The real turning point, however, will come the day local giant Emirates and its smaller partner, flyDubai, relocate to the new airport from their current home at Dubai International. This move has long been on the cards, but it has no known timeframe yet. According to Nadine Itani, program leader for air transport management at the University of Surrey in England, Emirates\u2019 shift to DWC is more than a relocation. \u201cIt\u2019s a strategic realignment in response to the changing dynamics of the global air travel and trade market,\u201d says the aviation expert, who notes that Dubai\u2019s bet on DWC as a future mega-hub is not an isolated move. There is currently a race in the region to invest in new, large-scale airport facilities and no one wants to lag behind. The region\u2019s flag carriers are not only keen to claim their share of global travel flows and position their capital cities as international trade centers, but also, increasingly, to establish themselves as tourist destinations in their own right. Shiny new airports will support these efforts. \u201cThere has been a notable shift in the incoming traffic mix into Dubai with a decrease in connecting passengers and an increase in terminating passengers, coupled with the anticipated surge in transport and logistics activity due to Dubai\u2019s role in the planned trade agreements such as the [India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor],\u201d says Itani. Inaugurated as recently as 2014, Hamad International Airport in nearby Qatar, a direct competitor of Dubai in the long-haul connectivity market, is gearing to expand its capacity to more than 60 million annual passengers. This adds to other airport expansion projects in the region: the opening of a $1.8 billion brand new airport in Muscat, Oman, in 2018, the $1.1 billion new terminal in Bahrain in 2021 and, more recently, in November 2023, of Abu Dhabi\u2019s grand new Terminal A, a 780,000-square-meter facility able to handle up to 79 aircraft simultaneously. At the northern end of the Gulf, Kuwait International Airport is building a new terminal designed by renowned British architectural firm Foster+Partners, which will have the capacity to handle 25 million passengers per year initially, with the possibility of doubling it up to 50 million in the future. And less than 20 miles from Dubai\u2019s downtown, Sharjah International Airport, which is primarily home to low-cost carrier Air Arabia, is also increasing its capacity to 20 million passengers annually. Saudi Arabia is also readying a massive airport expansion as part of its 2030 Vision, which has allocated $100 billion to prop up the kingdom\u2019s air connectivity and turn it into one of the world\u2019s top tourist destinations. In addition to a new international airline, Riyadh Air, the Saudi capital is also getting a gigantic new airport. Riyadh\u2019s new six-runway airport will, in fact, be built at the same location as the current one, fully replacing it. It will have capacity for 185 million passengers per year, or almost seven times the number it handled in 2022. When it comes to claiming the top spot in the global airport league tables, the stakes are higher than ever.", "articleSection": ["travel"], "author": [], "dateModified": "2024-02-29T11:56:45.352Z", "description": "Al Maktoum International has already been open for 13 years, but Dubai Airports says it plans to transform it into the biggest, busiest airport in the world by far.", "headline": "Dubai wants to build the biggest airport in the world.

The panel, created after fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019\u00a0but before the recent incident in which a door plug blew out the side of an aircraft,\u00a0found \u201cgaps in Boeing\u2019s safety journey.\u201d It also identified \u201chesitation in reporting safety concerns for fear of retaliation\u201d because of management conflicts of interest and said confusion about the safety programs \u201cmay discourage employees from submitting safety concerns.\u201d Boeing said in a statement to CNN that it has \u201ctaken important steps to foster a safety culture that empowers and encourages all employees to share their voice. But there is more work to do.\u201d \u201cWe will carefully review the panel\u2019s assessment and learn from their findings, as we continue our comprehensive efforts to improve our safety and quality programs,\u201d Boeing\u2019s statement said.

The panel was not charged with reporting on any specific incident involving Boeing aircraft. \u201cHowever on several occasions during the expert panel\u2019s activities, serious quality issues with Boeing products became public.

Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) saw its shares jump nearly 2%, to $429, on Monday morning after closing with a market cap of $905 billion on Friday. Only a handful of companies worldwide has ever reached the $1 trillion milestone, among them tech giants Amazon, Apple and Microsoft. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate reported a record cash hoard Saturday in its fourth-quarter earnings. Berkshire has about $167.6 billion in cash and equivalents, breaking last quarter\u2019s record-high $157.2 billion. For the year, operating earnings rose to $37.3 billion, after setting a record of $30.8 billion in 2022. But in Buffett\u2019s annual letter to shareholders over the weekend, the famed investor and CEO said he sought to manage expectations. He emphasized that longevity and constancy are at the core of the company\u2019s ethos, adding that seismic deals and skyrocketing performance are likely a thing of the past. \u201cBerkshire should do a bit better than the average American corporation and, more important, should also operate with materially less risk of permanent loss of capital,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnything beyond \u2018slightly better,\u2019 though, is wishful thinking.\u201d The Oracle of Omaha noted a lack of opportunity for Berkshire Hathaway to invest in or acquire companies that would make a strong financial impression on the conglomerate\u2019s performance. That is especially true for businesses outside the United States, Buffett said, noting that internationally, \u201cthere are essentially no candidates that are meaningful options for capital deployment at Berkshire.\u201d In 2023, Berkshire increased its investment in five major Japanese companies: Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo. The companies span a wide range of industries, including textile production, mining, electricity and automotive manufacturing. Since the interest in these companies is \u201cmore broad\u201d than Berkshire\u2019s, Buffett said there \u201cis the possibility that our investment may lead to opportunities for us to partner around the world with (these) five large, well-managed and well-respected companies.\u201d But due to Berkshire\u2019s size, buying shares to build a large position in these companies is a long-term undertaking that requires patience, Buffett said. \u201cThe process is like turning a battleship,\u201d he wrote.", "articleSection": ["business", "investing"], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Eva Rothenberg", "url": ""}], "dateModified": "2024-02-26T17:17:16.521Z", "description": "Berkshire Hathaway neared a $1 trillion market valuation Monday after a record-breaking year, but\u00a0CEO Warren Buffett warned in his annual letter to investors that more skyrocketing performances are likely a thing of the past.", "headline": "Warren Buffett: Berkshire\u2019s boom days may be over as his company approaches $1 trillion in value", "image": [{"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-526927858.jpg?c=original", "caption": "Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., laughs while playing cards on the sidelines the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S., on Sunday, May 1, 2016.", "sourceOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Bloomberg via Getty Images"}, "width": "2000", "height": "1334", "creditText": "Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images", "dateCreated": "2016-05-01T04:00:00.000Z"}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-526927858.jpg?c=original", "caption": "Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway.", "sourceOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Bloomberg via Getty Images"}, "width": "2000", "height": "1334", "creditText": "Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images", "dateCreated": "2016-05-01T04:00:00.000Z"}], "thumbnailUrl": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-526927858.jpg?c=original", "inLanguage": "en", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@context": "https://schema.org", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/26/investing/berkshire-stock-record-profits-2023/index.html", "dateModified": "2024-02-26T17:17:16.521Z", "inLanguage": "en", "additionalType": "article_leaf", "publisher": {"@type": "NewsMediaOrganization", "name": "CNN", "logo": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61", "foundingDate": "1980-06-01", "url": "https://www.cnn.com", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/cnn/", "https://twitter.com/CNN", "https://www.instagram.com/cnn/", "https://www.youtube.com/cnn"]}, "name": "Warren Buffett: Berkshire\u2019s boom days may be over as his company approaches $1 trillion in value", "headline": "Warren Buffett: Berkshire\u2019s boom days may be over as his company approaches $1 trillion in value", "description": "Berkshire Hathaway neared a $1 trillion market valuation Monday after a record-breaking year, but\u00a0CEO Warren Buffett warned in his annual letter to investors that more skyrocketing performances are likely a thing of the past.", "datePublished": "2024-02-26T17:17:16.521Z"}, "publisher": {"@type": "NewsMediaOrganization", "name": "CNN", "logo": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61", "foundingDate": "1980-06-01", "url": "https://www.cnn.com", "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/cnn/", "https://twitter.com/CNN", "https://www.instagram.com/cnn/", "https://www.youtube.com/cnn"]}, "timeRequired": "P0Y0M0DT0H1M40S", "wordCount": 376, "datePublished": "2024-02-26T17:17:16.521Z", "isAccessibleForFree": false, "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": false, "cssSelector": ".article__content"}}]
