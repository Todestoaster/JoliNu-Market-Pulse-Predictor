            "title": "Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun to leave as firm faces safety crisis",
            "text": "Boeing boss Dave Calhoun will leave at the end of this year amid a deepening crisis over the firm's safety record. Boeing also said that the head of its commercial airlines division will retire immediately while its chairman will not stand for re-election.  The firm is under pressure after an unused door blew out of a Boeing 737 Max in January shortly after take-off. No-one was injured but the firm's safety and quality control standards came under renewed scrutiny. Mr Calhoun took on the chief executive role in early 2020 after the previous boss, Dennis Muilenburg, was ousted in the aftermath of one of the biggest scandals in Boeing's history. Within the space of five months, two brand new 737 Max planes had been lost in almost identical accidents that claimed the lives of 346 passengers and crew. A board member at the time, after being made boss Mr Calhoun promised to strengthen Boeing's \"safety culture\" and \"rebuild trust\". However, in January this year a disused emergency exit door blew off a new Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max shortly after take-off from Portland International Airport. An initial report from the US National Transportation Safety Board concluded that four bolts meant to attach the door securely to the aircraft had not been fitted. Boeing is facing a criminal investigation into the incident itself, as well as legal action from passengers aboard the plane. Many analysts said a change in Boeing's leadership was overdue.  \"A shake-up at the top is necessary,\" said Stewart Glickman, equity analyst at CFRA Research, adding that he believed the current crisis stemmed from problems in the firm's corporate culture that only fresh insight would be able to fix. \"I don't think you can change the culture with internal voices because I think this has been modus operandi for this company for too long.\" In a letter to staff on Monday, Mr Calhoun described the Alaska Airlines incident as a \"watershed moment\" for Boeing and said it had to respond with \"humility and complete transparency\". \"The eyes of the world are on us, and I know that we will come through this moment a better company,\" he said. Air safety campaigner Ed Pierson, a former senior manager at Boeing's 737 factory in Renton, Washington, said Mr Calhoun had had years to try to boost safety at the company. \"It's been one failure after the other,\" said Mr Pierson, who is now executive director at The Foundation for Aviation Safety.  \"The company deserves much better leadership and the people who get on these airplanes deserve much better leadership.\" The blowout had tested Boeing's relationships with its airline customers and regulators in Washington, reviving concerns that the company's corporate culture had focused on speed of production ahead of safety. The Federal Aviation Administration said earlier this month that a six-week audit of the 737 Max production process at Boeing and its supplier Spirit Aerosystems had found \"multiple instances where the companies failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements\". Another report into Boeing's safety culture by an expert panel found a \"disconnect\" between senior management and regular staff, as well as signs that staff were hesitant about reporting problems for fear of retaliation. After the two plane crashes in October 2018 and 2019, it was discovered that flawed flight control software caused the incidents - details of which Boeing was accused of deliberately concealing from regulators. The company agreed to pay $2.5bn (\u00a31.8bn) to settle fraud charges and admitted deception, though in later court hearings it formally pleaded not guilty. It subsequently faced widespread accusations that it had put profits ahead of passengers' lives. Mark Pegram, whose 25-year-old son Sam died when Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crashed in 2019, said Mr Calhoun had appeared to have been brought in to say what investors wanted to hear and \"not fix the cause of the problems that were making planes fall out of the sky\".  He said he was pleased by the change but disappointed it had taken so long. \"It's something we've been calling for for quite some time now,\" he said. The crisis at Boeing has caused wider disruption in the travel industry as the company, one of the world's two major jet-makers, slows its manufacturing lines to try to get a grip on the problems. Airlines, including Ryanair, have warned of higher ticket prices and more limited flight schedules as they face delayed aircraft deliveries. On Monday, Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said that the company \"welcomed\" Boeing's management changes, specifically the departure of Stan Deal who is leaving his role as head of the commercial airlines division immediately.  Mr O'Leary said: \"Stan Deal has done a great sales job for Boeing for many years but he is not the person to turnaround the operation in Seattle and that's where most of the problems have been in recent years.\" Scott Hamilton, managing director of Seattle-based aircraft and economics research firm Leeham Company, told the BBC's Today programme: \"I've never quite understood O'Leary's defence of Calhoun. \"I certainly understand his criticism of Stan Deal, now the former chief executive of Boeing commercial airplanes. but I've never understood his defence of Calhoun quite frankly.\" Mr Hamilton added: \"I think the rank and file [at Boeing] are happy to see the changes. The unknown, of course, is who is going to come in to replace Calhoun.\" Speculation has already started on who that might be but the pool of people with qualifications for such a job is small.  Air transport consultant John Strickland of JLS Consulting warned that the hard work for the company was still ahead. \"It's all very well to get rid of people but what are you going to do to keep steering the business,\" Mr Strickland said. \"This is much easier said than done.\" Shares in the company rose more than 1% after the changes were announced. Mr Deal will will be replaced as head of Boeing's commercial airlines division by Stephanie Pope who has spent the past three months working as Boeing's chief operating officer. Larry Kellner, the firm's chair will also leave and be replaced by Steve Mollenkopf, the former boss of Qualcomm, the chip-maker, who has been a board member at Boeing since 2020. He will lead the search for a new chief executive.",

            "title": "Boeing: How much trouble is the company in?",
            "text": "\"It's as if I'm watching a troubled child\" is how Captain Dennis Tajer describes flying a Boeing 737 Max. The lead spokesman of the Allied Pilots Association, the pilots union for American Airlines, insists he would never board an aircraft if it were not safe.  But he says he can no longer take the quality of the plane he's flying for granted. \"I'm at an alert status that I've never had to be in on a Boeing airplane,\" he says. \"Because I don't trust that they've followed the processes that have previously kept me safe on Boeing airplanes for over three decades.\" Executives at the aerospace giant's shiny new headquarters in Arlington, Virginia could be forgiven for feeling like they are under siege. Every day seems to bring more bad headlines for the company, which is coming under pressure from regulators and airlines, and has seen its reputation badly damaged. The trouble began in January, when a disused emergency exit door blew off a brand new Boeing 737 Max shortly after take-off from Portland International Airport. An initial report from the US National Transportation Safety Board concluded that four bolts meant to attach the door securely to the aircraft had not been fitted. Boeing is reportedly facing a criminal investigation into the incident itself, as well as legal action from passengers aboard the plane. But although no-one was seriously hurt, the affair had much wider repercussions. It cast a harsh spotlight on the aerospace giant's corporate culture and attitude to safety. Flight 1282: The Blowout Every passenger's worst nightmare: the terrifying moment a plane door rips away mid-air.  Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Five years ago Boeing faced one of the biggest scandals in its history, after two brand new 737 Max planes were lost in almost identical accidents that cost 346 lives. The cause was flawed flight control software, details of which it was accused of deliberately concealing from regulators.  The company agreed to pay $2.5bn (\u00a31.8bn) to settle fraud charges, and admitted deception, though in later court hearings it formally pleaded not guilty. It subsequently faced widespread accusations that it had put profits ahead of passengers' lives.  It reaffirmed its commitment to safety, and in early 2020 its newly appointed chief executive Dave Calhoun promised it could \"do better. Much better.\" Yet the scrutiny that followed the incident in January this year has called that commitment into question. Addressing those concerns, Mr Calhoun said: \"We will go slow, we will not rush the system and we will take our time to do it right.\" Earlier this month the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, said that a six-week audit of the 737 Max production process at Boeing and its supplier Spirit Aerosystems had found \"multiple instances where the companies failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements\". The findings came shortly after another report into Boeing's safety culture by an expert panel found a \"disconnect\" between senior management and regular staff, as well as signs that staff were hesitant about reporting problems for fear of retaliation. Adam Dickson, a former senior manager at Boeing who once worked on the 737 Max programme, agrees there is a gulf between executives and workers on the factory floor. \"The culture at Boeing has been toxic to trust for over a decade now,\" he says. \"You can add safety steps, you can add procedures. But the fundamental issue of distrust makes those changes almost ineffective\", he claims. Meanwhile, further evidence of how production problems could endanger safety emerged this week.  The FAA warned that improperly installed wiring bundles on 737 Max planes could become damaged, leading to controls on the wings deploying unexpectedly, and making the aircraft start to roll. If not addressed, it said, this \"could result in loss of control of the airplane\". Hundreds of planes already in service will have to be checked as a result.  Boeing said based on the FAA audit it was continuing \"to implement immediate changes and develop a comprehensive action plan to strengthen safety and quality, and build the confidence of our customers and their passengers.\" But concerns about Boeing's production standards are far from new. Whistleblower John Barnett, who was found dead last weekend, had worked at Boeing's factory in South Carolina from 2010 until his retirement in 2017. A quality manager on the 787 Dreamliner programme, he had claimed the rush to build planes as quickly as possible in order to maximise profits had led to unsafe practices. Among a number of allegations, he told the BBC that in some cases under-pressure workers had deliberately fitted substandard parts to planes on the production line. Boeing denied his claims. But his untimely death, which occurred between legal hearings in a lawsuit against the company, has focused new attention on them. The crisis at the aerospace giant is now causing problems for airlines. Ryanair has warned that delays to new aircraft deliveries will push up prices for passengers in Europe this summer. US carrier Southwest plans to cut its capacity this year because it can't get hold of the planes it needs. Some carriers may try to obtain Airbus models to replace the lost Boeings. But a wholesale transfer of orders from the American manufacturer to the European is simply impractical. Both have very full order books. Airbus has a backlog of more than 8,000 planes and Boeing more than 6,000.  Airlines are already having to wait longer than they would like for new aircraft. Airbus has had its own supply chain problems, leading to late deliveries.  There is a potential third player. The Chinese manufacturer Comac has developed the C919, a plane designed to compete with the 737 Max and the A320 neo. But that programme is still in its infancy. By 2028 it will be producing only 150 aircraft a year. In other words, the market needs Boeing to be healthy, and to overcome its current problems quickly. So can that happen? According to Ed Pierson, executive director at the Foundation for Aviation Safety, the issues involved are complex, but fixable. Himself a former Boeing whistleblower, he has spent years lobbying regulators to take a firm approach to the company. \"Boeing, their suppliers, airlines, and government agencies are capable of overcoming these challenges, but the first step in fixing these problems is being honest,\" he says \"They need to admit these problems exist and stop trying to spin the truth. The more they spin, the longer it takes to solve the problems and the greater the risk.\" Boeing says that over the last several years, it has \"never hesitated to slow down, to halt production, or to stop deliveries to take the time we need to get things right\".  It added that it has launched a \"Speak Up\" programme encouraging staff to raise issues that need to be addressed.",

            "title": "United Airlines flight 433 lands safely without panel in Oregon",
            "text": "A Boeing plane landed without one of its fuselage panels at an airport in the US state of Oregon on Friday, says United Airlines.  A spokesperson said United flight 433, from San Francisco, arrived at the Rogue Valley International Airport in Medford, Oregon, at about 11:30 (18:30 GMT) on Friday. The 25-year-old Boeing 737-800 was carrying 139 passengers and 6 crew. No-one was injured - the missing panel went unnoticed during the flight. Boeing is under fierce scrutiny after a series of high-profile safety incidents. Amber Judd, a senior official at Rogue Valley International Medford Airport, said the plane landed safely and the external panel was only discovered missing during a post-flight inspection. \"We'll conduct a thorough examination of the plane and perform all the needed repairs before it returns to service,\" she said. An investigation would be carried out \"to better better understand how this damage occurred\", she added. The missing panel was next to the landing gear, on the underside of the aircraft, according to images of the aircraft on social media. All outgoing and incoming flights were paused at the airport to search for debris, none was found.  The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was investigating how the panel came apart. Boeing came under renewed scrutiny after a January incident involving a Boeing 737 Max 9 - part of a new range of planes to succeed older 737s - saw an unused cabin door blow out a few minutes after take-off in January. The incident on board Alaska Airlines flight 1282 left a gaping hole in the side of the plane and forced an emergency landing. Testifying before US lawmakers on 7 February after the Alaska Airlines blowout incident, the head of the FAA, Mike Whitaker, said inspections of 737 Max aircraft had shown that \"the quality system issues at Boeing were unacceptable and require further scrutiny\". Initial findings of a probe found that four key bolts that were meant to lock the unused door to the fuselage appeared to be missing. Mr Whitaker said that Boeing would be held accountable for any future failure or refusal to comply with the FAA.  Earlier this month, fumes detected in the cabin of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737-800 bound for Phoenix forced pilots to return to Portland airport. On Monday, at least 50 people were injured after a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner flying from Australia to New Zealand suddenly dropped without warning, leaving passengers who were not wearing seatbelts tossed into aisles and flung into the ceiling. In response to that incident, Boeing has told airlines that pilots need to check their seats - after reports said a flight attendant accidentally hit a switch in the cockpit which pushed the pilot's seat forward into the controls - forcing the plane's nose down. Despite the reported incidents, commercial aviation remains one of the safest ways to travel, experts and regulators say.

            "text": "A former Boeing employee known for raising concerns about the firm's production standards has been found dead in the US.  John Barnett worked for Boeing for more than 30 years before retiring in 2017. In the days before his death, he had been giving evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit against the company.  Boeing said it was saddened to hear of Mr Barnett's passing. The Charleston County coroner confirmed his death to the BBC on Monday.  It said the 62-year-old had died from a \"self-inflicted\" wound on 9 March and police were investigating.  Mr Barnett had worked for the US plane giant for three decades, until his retirement in 2017 on health grounds.  From 2010, he was employed as a quality manager at the North Charleston plant. The facility builds the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes.  In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line.  He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied. He later told the BBC that workers had failed to follow procedures intended to track components through the factory, allowing defective components to go missing.  He said in some cases, sub-standard parts had even been removed from scrap bins and fitted to planes that were being built to prevent delays on the production line. He also claimed that tests on emergency oxygen systems due to be fitted to the 787 showed a failure rate of 25%, meaning that one in four could fail to deploy in a real-life emergency. Mr Barnett said he had alerted managers to his concerns, but no action had been taken.  Boeing denied his assertions. However, a 2017 review by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), did uphold some of Mr Barnett's concerns. It established that the location of at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts in the factory was unknown, and that they were considered lost. Boeing was ordered to take remedial action. On the oxygen cylinders issue, the company said that in 2017 it had \"identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly\". But it denied that any of them were actually fitted on aircraft. After retiring, he embarked on a long-running legal action against the company.  He accused it of denigrating his character and hampering his career because of the issues he pointed out - charges rejected by Boeing. At the time of his death, Mr Barnett had been in Charleston for legal interviews linked to that case. Last week, he gave a formal deposition in which he was questioned by Boeing's lawyers, before being cross-examined by his own counsel. He had been due to undergo further questioning on Saturday. When he did not appear, enquiries were made at his hotel.  He was subsequently found dead in his truck in the hotel car park.  Speaking to the BBC, his lawyer described his death as \"tragic\".  In a statement Boeing said: \"We are saddened by Mr. Barnett's passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.\" His death comes at a time when production standards at both Boeing and its key supplier Spirit Aerosystems are under intense scrutiny. This follows an incident in early January when an unused emergency exit door blew off a brand-new Boeing 737 Max shortly after take-off from Portland International Airport. A preliminary report from the US National Transportation Safety Board suggested that four key bolts, designed to hold the door securely in place, were not fitted. Last week, the FAA said a six-week audit of the company had found \"multiple instances where the company allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements\".",

It comes after 50 people were hurt this week when a 787 dropped suddenly during a Latam Airlines flight. The Wall Street Journal reported that a flight attendant accidentally hit a switch on the pilot's seat, which pushed the pilot into the controls, forcing down the plane's nose. Latam is supporting investigations. During the incident people were thrown against the roof of the plane, which was travelling from Australia to New Zealand. Passenger Brian Jokat said at the time that a number of people suffered head injuries. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Jokat revealed that people had hit the ceiling with such force \"some of the roof panels were broken\". The person next to him, he added, appeared to be \"glued to the ceiling\". \"I did think for a split second: 'This is it',\" he said. Emergency services later said one person was in a serious condition. Boeing said: \"The investigation of Flight LA800 is ongoing and we defer to the investigation authorities on any potential findings.\" \"We have taken the precautionary measure of reminding 787 operators of a service bulletin issued in 2017 which included instructions for inspecting and maintaining switches on flight deck seats.\" It recommended that operators perform an inspection of the switches \"at the next maintenance opportunity\". Chilean-Brazilian carrier Latam Airlines said it \"continues to work in coordination with the authorities in order to support the ongoing investigation\". The aircraft was scheduled to fly on from Auckland to Santiago, the capital of Chile. The departure was cancelled and a new flight scheduled for Tuesday. The incident comes after a door panel came off a Boeing plane in January this year, with a report in February finding bolts meant to secure the panel were missing.

            "text": "Lawyers for the Boeing employee-turned-whistleblower found dead by apparent suicide have hailed him as \"a brave, honest man of the highest integrity\". Authorities are currently investigating the death of John Barnett, from what appeared to be a self-inflicted wound. Mr Barnett retired after working more than 30 years at Boeing in 2017. He was giving evidence in a lawsuit against the company before his death. Two of his attorneys called on police to fully investigate how he had died. \"John was in the midst of a deposition in his whistleblower retaliation case, which finally was nearing the end,\" Robert Turkewitz and Brian Knowles said in a statement to the BBC. \"He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on. We didn't see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it.\" Calling on officials in Charleston, South Carolina to provide more information about what happened, they wrote: \"No detail can be left unturned.\" Mr Turkewitz and Mr Knowles added that Mr Barnett was somebody who \"cared dearly\" about his family, his friends and Boeing, from its pilots to its customers. From 2010 until his retirement on health grounds, Mr Barnett worked as a quality manager at the North Charleston plant making the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes. In that job, he \"learned of and exposed very serious safety problems with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and was retaliated against and subjected to a hostile work environment\", his lawyers said. After retiring, he embarked on a long-running legal action against the company. He accused it of denigrating his character and hampering his career because of the issues he pointed out - charges rejected by Boeing. At the time of his death, Mr Barnett had been in Charleston for legal interviews linked to that case and he gave a formal deposition last week in which he was questioned by Boeing's lawyers, before being cross-examined by his own counsel. He had been due to undergo further questioning on Saturday. When he did not appear, enquiries were made at his hotel. He was subsequently found dead in his truck in the hotel car park. Taking on his long-time employer had caused Mr Barnett to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and his health had been in decline, his brother told US media.  \"He was suffering from PTSD and anxiety attacks as a result of being subjected to the hostile work environment at Boeing, which we believe led to his death,\" Rodney Barnett said. Mr Barnett added that his brother \"was looking forward to having his day in court and hoped that it would force Boeing to change its culture\". The quality manager was known for raising concerns about the US plane giant's production standards, telling the BBC in 2019 that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He later told the BBC that workers had failed to follow procedures intended to track components through the factory, allowing defective components to go missing. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency.

But it denied that any of them were actually fitted on aircraft. Mr Barnett's death comes at a time when production standards at both Boeing and its key supplier Spirit Aerosystems are under intense scrutiny. Last week, the FAA said a six-week audit of the company had found \"multiple instances where the company allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements\".",

            "text": "One of the UK's biggest flight simulator businesses has closed blaming a lockdown voucher sales surge. Virtual Aerospace Limited, based in Stockport, said a \"huge backlog\" of 2,500 vouchers bought during the pandemic had been a factor in its demise.  The company has entered liquidation and shut all branches, including its Greater Manchester headquarters.  Customers with vouchers will have their details passed to liquidators.  Virtual Aerospace, which was set up in 2011, operated six simulators across its main Stockport site and two other locations in West Sussex and Northamptonshire. More than 40 flight instructors were employed at the business, which gave visitors the chance to replicate flying in popular planes including a Vulcan bomber and World War Two Spitfire. Demand on the operation caused by customers buying the vouchers to support the business during its 15-month pandemic closure \"massively affected new sales\", a statement on its website said. The statement added staff had \"tried everything\" to reduce the backlog and \"keep us alive\". The company ceased trading on 23 March on their website. David Waddington, from Burnley, who was due to use the Spitfire simulator, said he only found out about the liquidation on the morning he was supposed to visit.  Mr Waddington, 67, said: \"I went to check my emails before we set off and found two emails, one from 23 March saying it had closed. \"It'll probably be six months before I get any of the \u00a3100 back, and then it'll only be a percentage.\" The award-winning flight simulator firm flew more than 50,000 customers over an 11-year-period. It said it accepted customers would be \"mad\" following the news. The firm said despite \"thousands\" of hours of good will from engineers, pilots and the VA team, it \"was not enough to fend off\" the impact. \"We know many of you will be mad at us and that you invested in us in good faith and we feel awful and cannot apologise enough to anybody that has lost money in this situation,\" the statement read. Virtual Aerospace Ltd appointed Andrew Ryder from insolvency specialist JT Maxwell Limited on 13 February. Liquidators are now in the process of closing the premises, auctioning assets to pay outstanding creditors, and will be in touch with customers \"in due course\". The business telephone is directing customers to an email and its website appears to only show the statement online. Why not follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram?

There were no injuries in the incident, which involved a British Airways plane with 121 passengers on board and a Virgin Atlantic aircraft. Virgin Atlantic said its empty Boeing 787-9 was being towed from the stand at Terminal 3 when it happened. The airline added that the plane had just landed and was being transported to a different part of the airfield. One of the wings of the plane being towed clipped the other aircraft. The passengers on the British Airways flight were scheduled to depart to Accra, Ghana, at 12:40 BST. British Airways said it provided an alternative aircraft for them, which was rescheduled to take off at 18:00. Virgin Atlantic said it was investigating and that maintenance checks were being made on its aircraft, which has been taken out of service. The tow movement was provided by a ground-handling company under contract by Virgin Atlantic, it said. A Heathrow spokesperson said: \"We are working alongside emergency services and our airline partners in response to an incident involving two aircraft on the ground earlier today.\" The spokesperson added: \"At present, no passenger injuries have been reported and we do not anticipate there to be any ongoing impact to airport operations.\" Emergency services attended the scene as a precautionary measure. The Met Police said it was supporting the airport authorities and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch with an investigation into the circumstances.

            "text": "When India's Tata Group bought the country's national airline, it was welcomed as something of a miracle.  Air India had been mired in debt and under-funded state management for decades. No-one wanted even a piece of the iconic but loss-making carrier. But a deal was struck in 2021, just as the world was emerging from the pandemic - and airlines were betting big on revenge travel once borders reopened. They were right. The rebound is well and truly under way and air travel is off to a roaring start in 2024. There have been warnings of slower growth in the US, where spending is expected to plateau after a post-pandemic spike. But it is a different story on the other side of the world in Asia. \"If we look at the size of the opportunity in India, it's already the world's most populous country,\" Air India's chief executive Campbell Wilson told the BBC at a recent aviation event in Singapore. \"It has the geographic advantage... connecting regions of the world together. And it is a hugely underserved market.\" By 2042, India's domestic aviation market is expected to be five times the size it was in 2019, with Indians taking around 685 million trips every year, according to plane maker Airbus. That would make the South Asian nation one of the world's fastest-growing civil aviation markets, and third after China and the United States.  It is not just India. By the middle of the century, Indonesia, which now ranks 13th globally in passenger numbers, is predicted to jump to the fourth spot, analysts say. Air travel is also expected to boom in the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam in the coming decades. They are all emerging economies with young, growing populations that can afford to spend on travel. And it is showing: global air traffic jumped by 16% over the last year. But in Asia, the increase was almost twice as much, according to industry figures. Governments in these places are also investing in infrastructure to improve connectivity, which is essential in vast archipelagos like Indonesia and the Philippines. China, of course, is an obvious market - despite its currently sluggish economy, its travellers have emerged from zero-Covid rules to return to holidaying. Beijing is now offering visa-free travel to citizens of certain countries and some nations, like Thailand and Singapore, are reciprocating. \"We are pleased that people are beginning to travel out of China. It is probably one of the last countries to come back big in travel,\" says Glenn Fogel, chief executive of online travel agency Booking.com. But airlines are looking for alternative markets because of China's slowing economy, the uncertainty of doing business there and a fall in consumer spending. Enter the Philippines. \"Asia is a very exciting place to be - the Philippines is one of the most exciting places to be. Great opportunity there,\" says Michael Szucs, chief executive of the Philippine budget carrier Cebu Pacific.  The airline struggled through the pandemic without government support. And like many competitors around the world, it is also facing groundings over faulty Pratt & Whitney engines.  But it has seen a revival in the last two years, expanding and cornering more than half of its domestic market. A new Philippine government is also helping - it is privatising the international airport in Manila and plans to add runways throughout the archipelago to receive larger and more aircraft. Mr Szucs has high hopes for the country of around 115 million people, where per capita spending is rising: \"We've got an increasingly educated population that is relatively young, it's growing, with an increasing propensity to travel.\" India, on the other hand, is a trickier market to conquer. Air India faces a stiff domestic rival in Indigo, and a daunting challenge in matching Emirates and Qatar Airways, which regularly rank among the world's best airlines. But the successful salt-to-software conglomerate Tata has started to turn the ailing carrier around. The company has already spent millions of dollars investing in new planes, new branding and restructuring old and inefficient systems. Now it wants to consolidate its five airlines - three Air India subsidiaries, and two joint ventures, Air Asia India and Vistara (with Singapore Airlines). The goal: a highly regarded airline for international flyers, and a reliable low-cost option for domestic passengers. Mr Wilson hopes to restore Air India's glory - it was India's first airline, started by the Tatas in the 1930s and rebranded as Air India and nationalised in the 1950s. He believes winning the international market is key but will need \"connecting more cities around the world nonstop with India\" - and that will involve starting more routes and, of course, buying more aircraft. The company has already gone on a buying spree. It ordered more than 200 Boeing Max 8 and Max 10s in one of the largest airline deals in aviation history. But the Max family of planes is under scrutiny since a door plug blew off a 737 Max 9 plane mid-flight in the US, sparking concerns about the already delayed Max 10 model. This was after two deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019 because of flawed flight control software. The crisis at Boeing over its safety record has also seen the resignation of its chief executive Dave Calhoun.  \"When we have concerns, we raise it at the highest levels, including with Boeing,\" Mr Campbell said.  Mr Wilson sees Air India's future in turning India into a global transit hub, much like Dubai or Singapore. That might be a challenge given that some long-haul routes, especially to Europe, are yet to be reinstated after the pandemic.Meanwhile, travellers in these countries are choosing to fly within East and South East Asia, driving up air traffic in the region. But that could also be an opportunity for Air India, and for Delhi given that some South East Asian capitals are lagging behind other international aviation hubs like Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai. The industry, however, is upbeat because the pandemic is over, people are flying again and economies are bouncing back. \"The fact is people like to travel,\" Mr Fogel said. \"As long as economies are growing, we know that travel is going to grow a little bit faster. And our job is to try and get a bigger part of that growing pie.\"",

            "text": "Airbus has confirmed that it could buy parts of the Spirit Aerosystems business.  Spirit has a major operation in Northern Ireland, which manufactures the wings for the Airbus A220.  It is one of Northern Ireland's largest and most important manufacturing businesses with more than 3,000 employees. Earlier this month Airbus's rival Boeing confirmed it had begun talks aimed at buying Spirit. However it is unlikely that Boeing would want to keep the parts of the business which supply Airbus. In an interview with CNBC, Airbus's chief financial officer confirmed it may buy some Spirit assets. \"In light of the situation today where Boeing has potentially the interest to take over Spirit, we could also imagine that some of the work packages could find their way to Airbus and we take them over,\" said Thomas Toepfer. \"But that quite frankly is a discussion that's in the very, very early stages,\" he added. \"It's very important for us that we have a stable relationship with Spirit, over the last number of months we've worked with them to support their performance.\" Spirit has been in Northern Ireland since 2019 when it bought Bombardier's operations, ending a long period of uncertainty for the workforce. However the ownership of the Belfast operation is now in question again because of problems in Spirit's US business. Spirit began life as a spin-off from Boeing in 2005 and remains a key Boeing supplier, particularly for the Boeing 737. Some of its work for Boeing has suffered from delays and quality issues, which has exacerbated problems at Boeing.",

            "text": "The FBI is investigating a January Alaska Airlines flight, where a door plug on the aircraft, a Boeing 737 Max 9, blew out mid-air.  A criminal probe was confirmed by the FBI in a letter sent to those aboard the plane, identifying them as \"victims\".  None of the 177 passengers and crew were killed, but some were injured. A group has since sued Alaska Airlines for \"serious emotional distress, fear and anxiety\".  The FBI letters, sent to passengers on 19 March by a victim specialist within the FBI's Seattle Division, said that the criminal investigation may be \"lengthy\". They added that updates on the probe's progress could not be shared at this time. The letters confirm early media reports that the Department of Justice (DOJ) had launched a criminal investigation into the Boeing jetliner blowout, which occurred on a 5 January flight from Portland, Oregon to Ontario, California. Sources familiar with the investigation told the BBC's US news partner CBS in early March that the probe will look into whether Boeing violated an agreement it entered with the Justice Department in 2021, following two crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft.  More than 300 people died in the two crashes of Boeing's Max planes in 2018 and 2019. Boeing has not commented on the ongoing criminal probe. In a statement shared with media after news of the DOJ investigation emerged, Alaska Airlines said a federal probe is normal \"in an event like this\". \"We are fully cooperating and do not believe we are a target of the investigation,\" said the airline. The Alaska Airlines flight had to make an emergency landing in Portland after an outer section of the plane fell off shortly after take-off.  The loss of that section caused an uncontrolled decompression inside the aircraft, where passengers say they had to \"hold on for dear life\".  One passenger, Cuong Tran, told the BBC that his seat belt saved him as his phone, socks and shoes were ripped off 16,000ft above ground.  Mr Tran, who was sitting next to his friend one row behind the section which blew out, said he suffered injuries including a laceration to his leg.  Images shared online - and later by the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) - showed a wide hole in the side of the Boeing 737-9 Max aircraft, with oxygen masks dangling from the ceiling. The missing section of the plane was later found in the back garden of a Portland school teacher's home.  In a preliminary investigation US regulators found four critical bolts - meant to hold the so-called door plug in place - were missing from the flight. Shortly after the incident, officials from the NTSB said that Boeing had also placed restrictions on the plane involved in the incident days before it took off.  The jet had been prevented from making long-haul flights over water, said NTSB chief Jennifer Homendy, after pilots reported pressurisation warning lights on three previous flights made on that specific plane. The decision to restrict lengthy flights over water was so that the plane \"could return very quickly to an airport\" in the event the warnings happened again, she said. ",

            "text": "A major Indian airline is scaling back operations this month amid widespread flight cancellations and delays due to unavailability of its pilots. Since 31 March, Vistara has seen nearly 150 flight cancellations and 200 flight delays. Media reports said the disruption was caused by pilots going on mass sick leave to protest against changes post the airline's merger with Air India. Vistara says it is looking into better work-life balance for its pilots. A Vistara official told the BBC the airline was \"scaling back its network temporarily\" and that customers would be given refunds for cancelled flights. According to The Hindu newspaper, at meeting on Wednesday, Vistara CEO Vinod Kannan apologised to pilots for \"taxing schedules\" and sought their \"support\" in resolving concerns. Mr Kannan also said that flight cancellations would continue until the end of the month to create a pilot buffer. The Tata Group, which holds the majority stake in Vistara, bought debt-ridden Air India - formerly India's national carrier - from the government for $2.2bn (\u00a31.8bn) in 2021. It is now in the process of consolidating its airline business as it merges its various entities. A joint venture between Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, Vistara will invest $250 million for a 25.1% stake in the combined entity once the merger is complete. Reports over the past few days say pilots at Vistara are unhappy with the new pay structure and work hours offered as part of the merger process.  Pilots have also complained of haphazard rostering practices and raised concerns about their career prospects after the merger which is expected to be completed next year. According to an NDTV report, pilots have been falling ill with increasing frequency, \"flying at the limits of the maximum duty limitations\". This had led to concerns about their health and safety. A Vistara official told the BBC that the airline acknowledged their \"rosters had been utilised to the maximum\" and that it was working to modify the roster to ensure a \"better work-life balance\" for its pilots. The airline, however, said there had been no significant rise in pilots reporting sick and attributed the delay in flights in March also to other factors such as \"bird hits, planned maintenance, weather disruptions and congestion\".",

Cuong Tran told the BBC his seat belt saved him as his phone, socks and shoes were ripped off by an uncontrolled decompression 16,000ft above Portland. He is among seven passengers to have filed a lawsuit against Boeing, Alaska Airlines and Spirit AeroSystems. The companies declined to comment.  Images shared online - and later by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) - showed a wide hole in the side of the Boeing 737-9 Max aircraft, with oxygen masks dangling from the ceiling on 5 January. In a preliminary investigation US regulators found four critical bolts - meant to hold the so-called door plug in place - were missing from the flight which was bound for Ontario, California. None of the 177 passengers and crew on-board were killed but Mr Tran, who was sitting next to his friend one row behind the section which blew out, suffered injuries including a laceration to his leg. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Tran, 40, said it happened soon after take-off when he would usually be getting ready to doze off.  \"The captain said we had passed 10,000 feet. Then the hole blew out on us and I remember my body getting lifted up. Then my whole lower body got sucked down by the howling wind.\" Mr Tran said the decompression lasted around 10 or 20 seconds and he described looking around at other passengers who could not believe what was happening. \"It was probably the first time in my life I had a feeling of no control over everything. I was in disbelief over the whole situation,\" said Mr Tran. Flight 1282: The Blowout Every passenger's worst nightmare: the terrifying moment a plane door rips away mid-air.  Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) \"That feeling of no control is pretty terrifying. The suction was so strong and I was hanging on for dear life. Both my shoes ended up getting sucked out - I had my shoe on pretty tight too.  \"My phone which was in my hand disappeared.\" The plane was able to make its emergency landing back to Portland International Airport and passengers were seen to by emergency services. Mr Tran added: \"They said it took 30 minutes, but it felt like a lot longer.  \"I had no phone so had no idea of the time, so I was just sat there staring into the hole this whole time and hoped it wouldn't get any more damage.  \"That was the scariest moment - the waiting. My body is recovering, but there is a big scar in my leg. I don't know if it going to be gone any time.\" Mr Tran is one of several passengers suing Alaska Airlines, Boeing and manufacturer Spirit Aerosystems, claiming the event left them with physical injuries and \"serious emotional distress, fear, and anxiety\". The plaintiffs are seeking punitive, compensatory and general damages, although the lawsuit does not specify an amount. Spirit Aerosystems, Boeing and Alaska Airlines said it would not comment on pending litigation. Attorney Timothy A Loranger told the BBC the litigation process could take \"a couple of years\" as there are a lot of people involved. \"His [Mr Tran] leg was almost sucked out of the airplane if it wasn't for his seatbelt,\" Mr Loranger said. \"It is just terrifying.\" This lawsuit was filed in King County Superior Court, Washington, and is separate to another set of passengers who are suing Alaska Airlines and Boeing for $1bn - claiming negligence. Alaska Airlines initially grounded its 737 MAX 9 fleet of 65 aircraft. This was later followed by an Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) order for all airlines to ground the Boeing model - approximately 171 worldwide. Aviation giant Boeing has been under heavy regulatory scrutiny with probes into the company's safety and quality standards in its production process. On Wednesday, the NTSB said it will hold a two-day investigative hearing on the incident at the start of August. But NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said Boeing has been unable to produce key information about work performed on the Alaska Airlines plane before the mid-air scare. In a letter addressed to leaders of the Senate, Homendy said the door plug which failed had been opened so rivet repair work could be done in September last year. The work took place at Boeing's Renton, Washington, facility before delivery to Alaska Airlines on 31 October 2023. \"To date, we still do not know who performed the work to open, reinstall, and close the door plug on the accident aircraft,\" Homendy said. \"The absence of those records will complicate the NTSB's investigation moving forward.\"",

            "text": "The head of United Airlines is seeking to directly reassure travellers that his company's flights are safe, after recent mishaps have spooked customers. In a letter to the airline's millions of passengers, chief executive Scott Kirby said \"safety is our highest priority\". Last week, a panel from a plane's body fell off mid-flight and earlier this month a plane engine caught fire. United is reviewing what happened, Mr Kirby wrote. \"I want you to know that these incidents have our attention and have sharpened our focus,\" wrote Mr Kirby, adding that safety is at the centre of \"everything we do\".  He said the company was already planning to expand training for pilots and new maintenance technicians and would increase resources to manage its network of suppliers. United carried a record 165 million passengers on its planes last year and brought in $2.6 bn (\u00a32 bn). The company is counting on strong demand for travel to continue. Mr Kirby said the incidents - which also included a plane that lost a tire after take-off, among others - were all \"unrelated\". But it comes amid elevated attention on air travel incidents large and small.  In January, an emergency exit door on a nearly brand new Boeing plane blew off in mid-air, reviving wider questions about the quality of the jets produced by the company, one of the world's two major jet-makers. That was on Alaska Airlines. The Federal Aviation Administration said, as is customary, it was investigating the United incident involving the missing panel, which occurred on a 25-year-old plane.  Its absence was discovered after landing and pictures spread widely on social media.  United attributed the fire on the other plane, which made a safe emergency landing, to an \"engine issue\".  The FAA is also reviewing a number of other incidents. Fatalities and accidents on US commercial flights remain extremely rare, according to US government statistics.  ",

            "text": "An American pilot, caught over the alcohol limit before he was due to fly a passenger plane from Edinburgh to New York, has been jailed for 10 months.  Lawrence Russell, 63, was searched by airport security officers at about 09:15 on 16 June last year.  He was found to have two bottles of J\u00e4germeister in his carry on luggage - one of which was half full. A breath test revealed the Delta Airlines captain was more than twice the legal alcohol limit for pilots.  Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard Russell, from Georgia, has been treated for alcoholism.  Delta has been contacted for comment. The court heard Russell had not less than 49mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood.  This exceeded the strict legal limit which is 20mg of alcohol. Sheriff Alison Stirling said a prison sentence had to be imposed as a punishment and for the \"protection of the public\". The court previously heard the pilot was to take control of a Boeing 767 flight from Edinburgh Airport to JFK Airport in New York, which was due to take off at 10:35. His bags were selected for inspection by security staff who were said to have \"noted Mr Russell was wearing a pilot uniform, a lanyard around his neck and a Delta Airline crew pass\". The captain was \"identified as the owner of the bag\", which contained two bottles of the herbal liqueur. Fiscal depute Matthew Millar told the court one of the bottles had been opened and was \"half full\". Mr Millar said: \"Given Mr Russell was wearing a pilot uniform the police were contacted. \"Mr Russell identified himself to the constables and said he was the captain of the aircraft.\" He provided police with a sample of breath and, after being arrested, was taken to Livingston police station, West Lothian, where he provided a blood sample. The fiscal depute said when Russell was cautioned and charged he told officers: \"I'm terrified\". Following the pilot's arrest, the flight to New York was cancelled and Delta Airlines confirmed all the passengers were then helped with their travel plans. On Tuesday the court heard the father-of-two also has two previous convictions for driving while under the influence of alcohol in the US. Defence lawyer Pamela Rodgers said her client was a recovering alcoholic who had not drunk alcohol for 277 days and had completed the 12 Steps to Recovery rehab programme. Ms Rodgers said Russell was just the fourth pilot to be prosecuted in Scotland for attempting to fly while under the influence of alcohol and was \"remorseful\" for his actions. Lynne Barrie, procurator fiscal for Lothian and Borders, said: \"Lawrence Russell's conduct would have endangered many lives; the consequences could have been catastrophic.  \"He showed a reckless disregard for the safety of his passengers and crew. The pilot of a commercial aircraft holds the lives of hundreds in his hands. He would have put all of them at serious risk.   \"This conviction should send the message that crimes of this nature will be robustly dealt with.\"",

Brian Jokat said a number of people suffered head injuries after the Latam Airlines jet dropped unexpectedly, throwing some out of their seats. Fifty were hurt and 12 were taken to hospital on landing in Auckland. Emergency services said one person was in a serious condition. In total, New Zealand's St John ambulance service said it had \"assessed and treated approximately\" 50 patients who had been travelling on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which had taken off from Sydney. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Jokat revealed that people had hit the ceiling with such force \"some of the roof panels were broken\" while others had been thrown down the aisles after the plane \"dropped unlike anything\" he had ever experienced before. The person next to him, he added, appeared to be \"glued to the ceiling\". \"I did think for a split second: 'This is it',\" he said. \"There was blood coming from several people's heads and people were yelling and screaming and it was chaos,\" Mr Jokat added. Another passenger told Radio New Zealand they saw people \"flying around\" and leaving traces of their blood on the ceiling. Some were not wearing their seatbelts, Radio New Zealand reported, quoting one of those on board. Further details about the \"technical event\" or what caused it are still not known. FlightAware, an airline tracker, shows the aircraft losing altitude about two hours into the three-hour flight between the two cities. Chilean-Brazilian carrier Latam Airlines said it \"deeply\" regretted \"any inconvenience and discomfort this situation may have caused its passengers\". It said \"a technical event during the flight\" had \"caused a strong movement\" but provided no further information. \"The plane landed at Auckland Airport as scheduled,\" it added. The aircraft was scheduled to fly on from Auckland to Santiago, the capital of Chile.  The departure was cancelled and a new flight scheduled for Tuesday, RNZ reported.",

            "text": "Boeing has confirmed it has begun talks aimed at buying Spirit Aerosystems. Spirit has a major operation in Northern Ireland but it is unclear if Boeing would keep that part of the business. The Reuters news agency has reported that Airbus has explored the possibility of buying's Spirit's NI operation. Spirit manufactures the wings for the Airbus A220 at a factory in Belfast. Reuters added that a deal with Airbus is not likely to happen in the short term. Spirit is one of Northern Ireland's largest and most important manufacturing businesses with more than 3,000 employees. The company has been in Northern Ireland since 2019 when it bought Bombardier's operations, ending a long period of uncertainty for the workforce. However the ownership of the Belfast operation is now in question again because of problems in Spirit's US business. Spirit began life as a spin-off from Boeing in 2005 and remains a key Boeing supplier, particularly for the Boeing 737. Some of its work for Boeing has suffered from delays and quality issues which has exacerbated problems at Boeing. In a statement on Friday Boeing said: \"We believe that the reintegration of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems' manufacturing operations would further strengthen aviation safety, improve quality and serve the interests of our customers, employees, and shareholders. \"We have been working closely with Spirit AeroSystems and its leadership to strengthen the quality of the commercial airplanes that we build together. We confirm that our collaboration has resulted in preliminary discussions about making Spirit AeroSystems a part of Boeing again.\" The statement added that there can be no assurance that a deal will be reached. Spirit also confirmed that talks are underway adding it does not intend to comment further on market speculation until it deems further disclosure is appropriate or required. When Spirit bought Bombardier's NI operations in 2019 it ended a long period of uncertainty for around 3,000 workers. In the years before that deal there were real fears Bombardier could go bust, as the development of new passenger plane went hugely over time and budget. But less than five years on the uncertainty has now returned. If Boeing buys Spirit it is unlikely to want to continue working as a supplier to its arch rival, Airbus. Selling the A220 wing plant to Airbus would seem logical - but what about the other non-Airbus work which Spirit does in Belfast?  Airbus has said it does not comment on market speculation. Separately, the two firms are continuing to negotiate on what Spirit is paid for its work on the A220. ",

            "text": "Boeing is in talks to take over Spirit Aerosystems, the supplier that has been involved in many of its recent manufacturing issues. The company, a major global air parts supplier, was spun out of Boeing in 2005 as part of a cost-cutting drive.  It continues to rely on Boeing for more than two-thirds of its business. Boeing has been under pressure over its manufacturing pipeline after a piece of one of its planes blew off in mid-air in January. The US government's review of the blowout found that bolts meant to fasten the panel had been removed at Boeing's factory in Washington, apparently to fix damaged rivets, and had never been re-installed.  The piece had been made by Spirit, before being sent to Boeing for final assembly. This week, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has been examining Boeing since the incident, gave Boeing 90 days to develop a \"comprehensive action plan\" for improving its safety management systems.  Boeing has already been working closely with Spirit to address a spate of quality issues, which have caused delays to plane deliveries and led to the appointment of a new chief executive at Spirit last year. In a statement on Friday to Reuters news agency, Boeing said: \"We believe that the reintegration of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems' manufacturing operations would further strengthen aviation safety, improve quality and serve the interests of our customers, employees, and shareholders.\" Following reports of takeover talks, shares in Spirit jumped by more than 10% on Friday, giving it a market value of more than $3.7bn. But shares in Boeing slid more than 1% after the discussions were first reported in the Wall Street Journal. Spirit, which the Journal said was also considering a sale of its Northern Irish unit to Airbus, did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.  Spirit employs more than 20,600 people around the world, including about 3,400 in Belfast and 1,120 in Prestwick.",

            "text": "A new report for the US government has raised serious concerns about Boeing's safety management systems, adding to the scrutiny facing the US plane maker. The review found a \"disconnect\" between senior management and regular staff, and signs that safety-related messages and behaviours were not effectively implemented across the company. The report was ordered after crashes involving Boeing planes in 2018 and 2019. Boeing pledged to review the findings. \"We've taken important steps to foster a safety culture that empowers and encourages all employees to share their voice. But there is more work to do,\" the company said.  \"We will carefully review the panel's assessment and learn from their findings, as we continue our comprehensive efforts to improve our safety and quality programs.\" The company, one of two major global plane makers, has been under added pressure since last month, when a section of one of its passenger jets blew off in mid-air, forcing an emergency landing.  The incident, which narrowly avoided serious harm, revived questions about Boeing's manufacturing processes, years after the 2018 and 2019 accidents, which killed 346 people and led to accusations that the company had put profits before safety as it produced its planes. The panel of experts, which was convened after the earlier crashes, said Boeing had taken steps to improve, but that it saw indications of \"gaps in Boeing's safety journey\". It said some Boeing staff were hesitant to report problems and worried about retaliation because of how the reporting process was set up. Boeing also did not have a clear system for reporting problems and tracking how those concerns were resolved, it said.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would also review the findings. The agency is currently investigating Boeing's manufacturing processes, triggered by the 5 January blowout. It has barred the company from expanding production of its popular 737 Max planes while the review is under way. \"We will continue to hold Boeing to the highest standard of safety and will work to ensure the company comprehensively addresses these recommendations,\" the FAA said as it released the report.  The troubles at Boeing are expected to lead to delays delivering new planes to airlines, which Ryanair has said could cause ticket prices to rise. Other airlines have also voiced frustration over the issues.  Earlier this month, Boeing said it was replacing the person in charge of the 737 Max programme and creating a new position of senior vice president for quality.",

            "title": "MH370: The families haunted by one of aviation's greatest mysteries",
            "text": "For the last decade, two words have haunted Li Eryou - lost contact.  It's what Malaysia Airlines told him when flight MH370 disappeared, with his son Yanlin on board.  \"For years I have been asking what do you mean by 'lost contact'? It seems to me that if you lose contact with someone, you should be able to reconnect with them,\" Mr Li says.  He and his wife, Liu Shuangfeng - farmers from a village south of Beijing - have struggled to make sense of what has become one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history.  On 8 March 2014, less than an hour into a routine night-time flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, the pilot said goodnight to Malaysian air traffic control. The Boeing 777, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members, was about to cross into Vietnamese air space.  It then abruptly changed direction, and all electronic communications were cut. It turned back, first over Malaysia, and then out into the remote southern Indian Ocean until it is presumed to have run out of fuel. The biggest and most expensive search operation ever mounted lasted four years but failed to find any trace of the missing airliner. Thousands of oceanographers, aeronautical engineers and amateur sleuths have pored over the fragmentary data from the flight, trying to calculate where it ended its journey.  For the families of those on board these have been 10 years of inescapable grief, battling to keep the search going, to find out exactly what happened to MH370, and why. Mr Li has crisscrossed the world in support of that campaign. He says he has used up his savings travelling to Europe and Asia, and to beaches in Madagascar, where some debris from the missing plane has been found.  He says he wanted to feel the sand in a place where his son might have washed up. He remembers shouting out at the Indian Ocean, telling Yanlin he was there to take him home. \"I will keep travelling to the end of the world to find my son,\" he says.  The couple, now in their late 60s, live in a rural part of China's Hebei province. Most of their income went to pay for their children's schooling, and they never had the money to travel.  Yanlin was the first person in their village to go to university, and the first to get a job overseas, working in Malaysia for a telecom company.  He was returning to China for a visa appointment when the flight disappeared. \"Before this incident happened, we had never even been to the nearby city of Handan,\" Mr Li says.  Now seasoned travellers, they came back to Malaysia to mark the 10th anniversary with other families.  Yanlin was one of 153 Chinese passengers on the flight. His parents are among around 40 Chinese families who have refused settlement payments from the Malaysian government, and have filed legal cases in China against the airline, the aircraft manufacturer and other parties.  Over 10 years, the lives of those affected have moved on, yet they also feel chained to the missing plane.  Grace Nathan was doing her final law exams in the UK when MH370 disappeared. Her mother Anne was on board. Today she is a barrister with her own practice in Malaysia, and a mother of two young children.  At the anniversary commemoration in Kuala Lumpur, she recalled holding her mother's photograph as she walked down the aisle at her wedding, and missing her advice while she was going through two difficult pregnancies. On display there were a few battered pieces from the plane, the only physical evidence ever to be recovered from it. There were parts of the wing, corroded from their long immersion in the sea, with the surprisingly flimsy-looking internal honeycomb structure exposed.  In the crowd was Blaine Gibson, who has found more pieces of MH370 than anyone else. One of a colourful cast of characters drawn into the MH370 saga, Mr Gibson can best be described as an amateur adventurer. He dresses in the style of Indiana Jones and has used the proceeds of the sale of his family home in California to fund his love of travelling, with a personal goal of visiting every country in the world. \"When I attended the one-year anniversary event I learned that there was no organised search of shorelines for floating debris. It simply hadn't been done. They were spending millions of dollars back then searching underwater. And I just thought, well, probably the first piece of this plane is just going to be found by someone walking on the beach. And since nobody was doing that, I thought I could do it myself.\" He says he searched for a year, on beaches from Myanmar to the Maldives, before finding his first piece, from the rear stabilizer of the plane, on a sandbar in Mozambique.  By that time another large piece, known as a flaperon, from the wing, had already been found on Reunion Island, confirming to the families that MH370 had indeed crashed into the Indian Ocean.  The parts that were found were all discovered 16 months or more after MH370 vanished, washed up on various East African beaches.  Analysis of the prevailing currents in the southern Indian Ocean showed they were likely to have come from where MH370 was believed to have crashed into the sea.  The former lead Malaysian investigator Aslam Khan explained how they identified them. Serial numbers on some parts were matched with records held by the manufacturer to confirm beyond doubt that they came from the Malaysia Airlines Boeing.  Distinctive fonts used in the stencil markings on others showed they were near certain to have come from it. No other Boeing 777 has ever crashed in the Indian Ocean. Until the flaperon was found, the only evidence for the plane turning back on itself was data from military radar in Malaysia and Thailand, which spotted the plane flying west over the Malay peninsula.   Then a British company, Inmarsat, detected a series of six pings or \"handshakes\" made every hour between one of its satellites and MH370 as it headed south. All other communication on the aircraft had been switched off.  This sparse data was used to triangulate the distance between the plane and the satellite at each hour along a series of circular arcs, giving an approximate crash location. But this was still a huge area of very rough and very deep sea.  The search, involving 60 ships and 50 aircraft from 26 countries, lasted from March 2014 until January 2017. It was resumed in early 2018 for five months by a private US-based company called Ocean Infinity, using underwater drones to scan the seabed. The lack of hard information has fuelled many theories, some quite wild, about what happened on board MH370, from it being hijacked and flown to Russia, or perhaps to the US airbase on the island of Diego Garcia, to it being shot down.  \"This is obscene,\" French journalist Florence de Changy muttered looking at the pieces of MH370 on display. Ms Changy has written a meticulously researched book, one of more than 100 published on MH370. She argues that the entire hypothesis that the plane turned and went south has been faked. She believes that the debris which has been found is not from MH370. She raises questions over the cargo on board, and in her book suggests that it may have been shot down by US aircraft over the South China Sea because of this cargo. If, however, the radar and satellite data presented by Malaysia and Inmarsat is accepted at face value - and most experts do - and that the airliner kept flying south, there is only one plausible explanation. That someone flew it there deliberately. In a new BBC documentary, \"Why Planes Vanish\", two French aerospace experts, one an experienced pilot, have used a flight simulator to recreate the sharp turn the Boeing 777 made over the South China Sea, right after the last contact with Malaysian air traffic control. They have concluded that this could only have been done manually by a skilled and experienced pilot. The fact that this was done just as MH370 was moving from Malaysian to Vietnamese air space suggests to them that the pilot was trying to conceal the manoeuvre. And that he knew it would be some time before Vietnamese air traffic control reported that they had not yet been contacted by the plane. There are other theories - that everyone on board was knocked out by hypoxia, lack of oxygen, after an undetected depressurisation, or that a sudden catastrophic fire or explosion cut communications and forced the pilots to turn back. But the difficult manoeuvres, followed by continued, steady flight south for seven hours, make these very unlikely.  Yet the idea that one of the pilots deliberately flew the plane and all its passengers to a watery death is also hard to accept. Neither pilot had any history that could explain such an action. All this feverish speculation has exacted a toll on the families. \"I would not wish this on my worst enemy,\" says Jaquita Gonzalez, wife of Patrick Gomes, the Inflight Supervisor on MH370.  \"We have been going through such a rollercoaster. When they first started the search we would hear that they saw something, and then our hopes would be up high. And then after that we would hear no, it's not MH370. And we landed back on ground. Each time it was as if somebody had stood on top of us and taken our breath away.\" From the start the Malaysian government was criticised by the families. First for its confused handling of the initial response, with blunders like the failure to act quickly on the military radar tracking of MH370. And later, for its apparent reluctance to authorise further searches, after the last operation by Ocean Infinity ended in mid-2018.  The company has offered to resume the search on a no-find, no-fee basis, but needs the government's approval. Privately some Malaysian officials acknowledge that the government could have done more. Some of this can perhaps be explained by the country going through a period of extraordinary political turmoil in recent years. Then there was the pandemic, a huge distraction which also prevented the families from holding their annual commemoration. The current transport minister, Anthony Loke, sought to address this by attending the 10th anniversary event in Kuala Lumpur, and promising the families he would do everything possible to find the missing plane. He announced that he was now discussing with Ocean Infinity the possibility of resuming the search later this year. Ocean Infinity scanned an area of 112,000km, back in 2018. This though, encompassed some extremely challenging terrain, like deep underwater canyons, and it is possible it might have missed the aircraft. Retired British aerospace IT specialist Richard Godfrey, another person who has been pulled into the MH370 vortex, believes he has now pinpointed a much smaller search area, using innovative analysis of short-wave radio test transmissions made routinely by ham radio enthusiasts. This should allow a more concentrated search by the drones, making several passes over the same area. \"They record 1.7 billion records a year in their database. Imagine a huge fisherman's net, across the globe, full of radio signals. Every time an aircraft passes through this net, it breaks a hole in the net. That tells me where an aircraft was at a particular time. Over the six hours of MH370's flight into the southern Indian Ocean I have been able to find 313 anomalies in the radio signals at 95 different points in time. That gives you a much more refined flight route, and a more accurate determination of a crash location.\" Richard's method is currently being tested by the University of Liverpool, which expects to establish how valid it is later this year.  The families say they are encouraged by the latest promises made by the transport minister - a much-needed change of tone from the Malaysian government, they say. But they remain wary. Their hopes have been raised many times before. \"I just want the plane to be found,\" Ms Gonzalez says. \"At least then I can let my husband rest in peace. Right now, I have not done anything for him, you know, to give him a memorial. I can't, because we don't have anything tangible from him.\" At the commemoration a large board had been put up, on which people could write messages, of hope, of sympathy, or of grief. Li knelt down to write a message to Yanlin in large Chinese characters, and then sat in tears, looking at it. \"Son, it's been 10 years\", he had written. \"Your mum and dad are here to bring you back home. March 3rd, 2024.\" Why Planes Vanish: The Hunt for MH370 Ten years after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 and its 239 passengers and crew vanished, can new evidence help locate the plane and finally solve aviation's greatest mystery?

            "title": "Boeing: Aviation giant displays crisis management at Asia's top airshow",
            "text": "As the aviation industry gathers this week for the Singapore Airshow there is no shortage of military hardware made by US aerospace giant Boeing. Spectators have been treated to displays by the F-15 fighter and Apache attack helicopter. However, conspicuously absent from the event are Boeing's commercial jets. Instead, attendees of Asia's biggest airshow have to make do with models of Boeing's passenger planes or can step inside an \"immersive display\" of the Boeing 777X cabin.  And as the event was in full-swing, Boeing announced that the leader of the troubled 737 Max programme Ed Clark would leave the company. It's Boeing's first major aviation event since a cabin panel detached mid-flight from a brand new Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 in January. In a preliminary investigation of the Alaska Airlines incident, US regulators found four critical bolts - meant to hold the so-called door plug in place - were missing. It led the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to order a temporary global grounding of the aircraft.   The planes are now flying again but the FAA said it will not yet allow Boeing to expand production of its best-selling narrow body family of jets, which includes the 737 Max 9. In contrast, Boeing's arch-rival Airbus took to Singapore's skies with its A350-1000 passenger jet. In its latest earnings report, the European aerospace giant said it would deliver 800 planes this year, including its A320neo which is a competitor to Boeing's 737 Max. Since the Alaska Airline incident, Boeing orders have shrunk significantly, delivering just 27 planes in January, compared to 67 in December. After the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) preliminary investigation into the the Alaska Airlines incident , Boeing's president Dave Calhoun said, \"whatever final conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.\"  \"There is no message or slogan to do that. It will take transparency and demonstrated action - that starts with each of us along with a commitment to listening to each other and speaking up,\" he added. At the Singapore Airshow, Boeing marketing executive Dave Schulte said the plane was \"by far the most scrutinised\" and \"safest\" in the world, adding that he had flown on one with his family the previous week. Some of Boeing's biggest customers have voiced their frustrations with the company, with the boss of Emirates airline warning that Boeing is in the \"last chance saloon\" after a \"progressive decline\" in its performance.  This is not the first time Boeing has faced a safety crisis.  In 2018, the 737 Max 8 was grounded after two fatal crashes off the coast of Indonesia and over Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019. All together, 346 people were killed.  Those crashes were attributed to flaws in its flight control software, forcing both airplanes to make catastrophic dives, despite the best efforts of the pilots.  Boeing's biggest challenge is regaining the trust of both the buyers of its planes and those who fly on them, with editor of Asian Aviation magazine Matt Driskill saying it would be \"really hard\" for Boeing to earn back trust.  However, a powerful voice in the industry says he is confident that Boeing will take the right measures and regain its status as a world-class supplier of aircraft. \"Boeing has responded in the right way. They have taken ownership of the problem. They put their hands up. They acknowledged that there is a problem that they need to address and I think they're going about that in the right way,\" Willie Walsh, the head of global airline industry body IATA told the BBC. The Singapore Airshow also saw the unveiling of another competitor for Boeing's airline customers - Chinese state-owned planemaker Comac.  At the event's press preview day, the Comac C919, a rival to Boeing's 737 Max and Airbus' A320neo single-aisle jet families, made its international debut. The C919 started flying in China last year and the airline China Eastern placed an order for 100 of them, marking the largest order yet of the plane.  However, some aviation analysts say it will not be a serious international contender for quite some time due to slow production and the need to gain regulatory approval to fly outside China. Another concern is parts. The C919 may be made in China, but it relies heavily on international supply chains.  \"The majority of the parts that go into the plane are from the West. The engines, the engine controls, the in-flight entertainment, just about every component is made in either Europe or America.\" Mr Driskill said. Boeing is also keen to emphasise the 737 Max's prominent position in the airline industry, highlighting that somewhere in the world one of the planes takes off every 16 seconds. Greg Waldron, Asia Managing Editor of online aviation website FlightGlobal, points out that despite the latest safety problems Boeing remains hugely important to the global commercial aviation and defence industries. \"Not to mention that there's a federal political importance with Boeing as well, because of the sheer numbers of people it employs, \" he said. \"So is it too big to fail? It certainly is.\"",

            "text": "The leader of Boeing's troubled 737 Max programme is to leave the company, which has been under pressure since a piece of one of its jets blew out during a passenger flight in January.  The departure of Ed Clark after nearly 18 years at the firm is part of a wider shake-up of the commercial airplane division announced on Wednesday. Boeing said the changes were aimed at improving its quality and safety. It comes as the firm prepares to meet with regulators. The company has been facing scrutiny since the incident on the Alaska Airline flight, which did not lead to serious injuries but forced an emergency landing. The incident revived wider questions about manufacturing processes for Boeing's popular 737 Max planes, years after crashes involving a different version of the jets in 2018 and 2019 killed 346 people and led to a global grounding for 20 months.  Boeing was barred last month from expanding its 737 Max output by the Federal Aviation Administration, while the authority reviewed its production line for the planes. Other less serious flaws have troubled production in recent years as Boeing ramped up manufacturing following the grounding. A preliminary investigation of what went wrong on the 737 Max 9 jet flown by Alaska Airlines found that bolts meant to fasten the door panel were missing, after being removed inside Boeing's factory in Renton Washington. Ed Clark was vice president and general manager of the 737 programme, overseeing the Renton, Washington factory that produced the plane involved in the blowout. Calls followed from safety campaigners for new leadership at the firm.  He will be replaced by Katie Ringgold, currently vice president of 737 delivery operations. The company also announced it was creating a position of senior vice president for quality. In a message to staff on Wednesday, Stan Deal, the head of Boeing commercial airplanes division said the changes were aimed at \"ensuring that every airplane we deliver meets or exceeds all quality and safety requirements. Our customers demand, and deserve, nothing less\". He said Mr Clark was leaving with the company's \"deepest gratitude for his many significant contributions over nearly 18 years of dedicated service to Boeing\".",

            "text": "A decade after MH370 disappeared, are we any closer to finding the missing plane? Amateur investigators are convinced they know its location. Ten years ago, on 8 March 2014, Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing with 239 people aboard \u2013 and was never seen again. One decade later, the fate of the plane remains unsolved, and its tragic disappearance has become one of aviation's biggest and most captivating mysteries since Amelia Earhart's plane disappeared. In the aftermath of MH370's disappearance, a massive search ensued that continued for four years and cost millions of dollars. Even after official recovery efforts ended, amateur sleuths continued trying to locate the ill-fated plane, which disappeared from radar less than 40 minutes into the flight. But is the mystery of what happened to flight MH370 any closer to being solved, ten years on? Or at least the mystery of where the plane's wreckage might be located? Some of the searchers who have been trying to solve this case for the past decade say: yes. Richard Godfrey, a retired British aerospace engineer and creator of the site The Search for MH370, who's dedicated much of the past 10 years to that question, is convinced it would only take one more search in the right location to find MH370. Separately, Vincent Lyne, a former researcher from the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) at the University of Tasmania, who's published numerous papers on the topic has also been conducting his own independent investigation and is certain that the location of the plane is not a mystery. \"The precise location of MH370 is in a very deep 6000-metre hole about 1500 kilometres west of Perth and along the longitude of Penang,\" says Lyne. \"That location reconciles all evidence.\" But how did Godfrey and Lyne each grow so sure about the plane's exact location when years of official searches have turned up nothing? Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 left Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 12:41 a.m. on 8 March 2014, and was scheduled to arrive in Beijing Capital International Airport at 6:30 am local time. But what happened next has baffled analysts. The plane was last heard from when pilots on the flight communicated with air traffic controllers in Kuala Lumpur to indicate that the plane was moving into another country's airspace en route to Beijing.  \"After 40 minutes, it disappeared from civilian radar,\" Alessandra Bonomolo, director of a new documentary on the disappearance of MH370, Why Planes Vanish: The Hunt for MH370, said on a recent BBC podcast.  \"There had been communications a few minutes prior between the pilots and air traffic controllers in Kuala Lumpur who exchanged a brief conversation, which is entirely customary when they say that they are going to move on to a different airspace \u2013 [which] in that case would have been the Vietnamese airspace,\" Bonomolo explains on the podcast. \"And after that 'goodnight,' the air traffic controllers in Malaysia know that they are no longer responsible for that plane because it entered another nation's airspace.\"\u00a0 It was at the border of Malaysian and Vietnamese airspace that the plane disappeared and stopped communicating with air traffic controllers entirely, says Bonomolo. And that's where the mystery begins. As the state of registry for the aircraft, Malaysia was responsible for searching to find the missing plane. But at the request of the Malaysian government, the effort was led by the Australian Transportation Safety Bureau (ATSB). The search began on 17 March 2014, according to a report from ATSB, and continued for 1,046 days, wrapping up on 17 July 2018. The voluminous report later issued by ATSB added more pieces to the puzzle surrounding what MH370 did after signing off with air traffic controllers on that fateful night, indicating that \"subsequent analysis of radar and satellite communication data revealed the aircraft had actually continued to fly for a further seven hours. Its last position was positively fixed at the northern tip of Sumatra by the surveillance systems operating that night, six hours before it ended the flight in the southern Indian Ocean.\" Beyond that, says the report, searchers had very limited concrete information surrounding the whereabouts of the plane. The surface and underwater searches that were conducted covered several million square kilometres and amounted to the largest search in aviation history, says the report. And yet the plane was never found. The mystery surrounding flight MH370 is further deepened by the debate over what caused the plane to go missing. Was it hijacked? Did it experience mechanical failure? Or perhaps its pilot, 53-year-old Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, was somehow involved in what took place. These theories and more were widely circulated in media reports in the initial months and years after the plane disappeared, particularly the idea that Shah might have committed an act of murder-suicide. While Godfrey and Lyne do not work together or support each other's explanation of where the plane might be, both believe pilot involvement may not be off base. \"The captain had a flight simulator at home, where he simulated a flight to fuel exhaustion in the Indian Ocean,\" says Godfrey. The ATSB's final report confirms as much. The report says Shah's flight simulator had been used six weeks prior to 8 March 2014 to map a path somewhat similar to MH370's flight's route, taking off in Kuala Lumpur and proceeding \"up the Strait of Malacca, with a left-hand turn and track into the southern Indian Ocean\". But why would the pilot have decided to down his own plane, if that was the case? The answer may never be known, but the BBC documentary about MH370 (in which Godfrey appears), refers to reports about the mental health among airline pilots and significant incidence of depression that has been documented by some studies, as one potential motivation for a suicide mission. A study published by the journal Environmental Health, for instance, found that \"13.5% of 1430 pilots who reported working as an airline pilot in the last seven days at time of survey, met depression threshold\" while \"seventy-five participants (4.1%) reported having suicidal thoughts within the past two weeks\". \"If you ask the question, 'What was the motivation of the captain?' And there is no other motivation \u2013 he was well off, his relationships were sound, he wasn't about to get divorced\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 then you come back to his mental condition,\" says Godfrey. Working independently, Godfrey has continued his efforts to pinpoint the final resting place of the MH370 wreckage. Lyne has also been working on his own to do the same. Godfrey's effort has included studying what's known as WSPR signals of radio amateurs from the night of the plane's disappearance. Radio amateurs are constantly sending test signals and recording that signal data, something that's been taking place for decades. And here's why that data matters so much, he says: because when a plane flies through a radio signal, it disturbs the signal and from that disruption you can track the presence of an aircraft. \"So I went back to March 8, 2014 and downloaded all of the signals\" explains Godfrey. There are thousands of them, and I started from the last known point of MH370, defined by the radar, and tracked its path,\" explains Godfrey. \"The results from my tracking align exactly with the satellite data for MH370, and the Boeing data, and the oceanography data.\" All of that effort and more on Godfrey's part, including combining different data sets that were previously kept in separate domains, has brought him to the conclusion that the plane is resting 1,500 kilometres west of Perth, Australia. \"The MH370 crash location, defined by the WSPR technology, is within a circle with a radius of 30 kilometres and centred at 29.128\u00b0S 99.934\u00b0E,\" says Godfrey. \"This area is 1,560 kilometres west of Perth, Australia. It will only take one more search of this area and we will find MH370.\" Lyne meanwhile, has said the plane will be found west of Perth along the longitude of Penang. This location is significant because Penang was the pilot's hometown and the plane was found to have taken a detour to Panang in the hours after it went off course, perhaps so Shah could have a final look. \"Someone [on MH370] was looking at Penang. Someone was taking a long, emotional look at Penang,\" where the captain was from, explained Captain Simon Hardy, an experienced Boeing pilot, in 2015. Lyne believes the precise location of MH370 and its planned flight track was decoded from Shah's pilot simulator information. Similar to Godfrey, Lyne cites a great deal of information he has sorted through from 8 March 2014 that further supports his location theory, such as a 300 kilometre trail of cloud anomalies corresponding to the final flight track of MH370. \"This was from the pilot trying to hide by flying within the clouds, but instead left a long-lasting trail of highly visible anomalies in five independent satellite images from three satellite passes,\" says Lyne. \"There is only one person on that plane who could have masterminded that secret flight path and landing location that had personal significance in relation to being along the Penang longitude,\" says Lyne. The greatest challenge, Lyne believes, to ultimately finding the plane is that \u201cdue diligence\u201d surrounding any new theory or location proposed generally gets rejected by officials who are focused on continuing to search in a region referred to as the 7th arc. As ATSB documents explain, the 7th arc is an area \u2013 based on analysis of satellite data and drift modelling \u2013 that MH370 is believed to have reached when it ran out of fuel and began to descend. Lyne says the 7th arc is the wrong location because it's based on \"the impossible notion that a plane running out of fuel immediately suffers a high-speed gravitationally accelerated dive but with not even a shred of debris\" in the area. \"There is no competent international science review group, which I\u2019ve called to be established, to objectively assess all evidence and to recommend a new search strategy,\" adds Lyne. \"Instead [the] new search plan is exclusively extending out from the 7th arc or within a small poorly surveyed area, which one group claims is hiding MH370.\" There has been talk of more searches taking place to find MH370. Locating the wreckage would help resolve many of the outstanding mysteries and questions surrounding the doomed flight, perhaps most importantly, who was flying the plane when it disappeared and whether it was indeed the captain. \"We won't have enough evidence to stand up in a court of law and decide who is guilty until we find the wreckage and the black box in order to solve this mystery,\" says Godfrey. \"Finding the wreckage would also allow us to figure out who was in the cockpit. And doing DNA samples from the skeletons in the cockpit would tell us who was there.\" \"Only then can we learn the lessons of this event in order to make aviation safer in the future,\" says Godfrey. Wherever the wreckage is located, it is likely sitting at least 3,000 to 4,000 metres underwater, in a deep, dark and very cold environment \u2013 one that's ideal for preserving evidence, says Godfrey, even ten years after the fact. -- If you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

After a seven-hour journey across the Atlantic, FlightRadar shows flight UA883 on a path toward New York before making a sharp detour south-east toward Bangor. \"United flight 883 landed in Bangor this morning after two passengers, who appeared intoxicated, became disruptive,\" the airline said in a statement. \"Law enforcement officials removed the two passengers and the flight has already re-departed for Newark Liberty International Airport. The customers will be banned from future United flights while we review this matter.\" The flight - which had 150 people on board and 10 crew members - left London at 07:52 GMT and landed safely in Maine at about 10:00 local time (15:00 GMT), the Federal Aviation Administration added in a statement. It described what happened on board the Boeing 767 as a \"passenger disturbance\". Bangor Police Department said their officers assisted Customs and Border Protection and the FBI, who are now handling the investigation, in removing the two passengers.",

            "title": "Ryanair warns of 10% fare rise as new Boeing planes delayed",
            "text": "The boss of Ryanair has said holidaymakers will face higher fares this summer due to new Boeing planes being delivered late. Chief executive Michael O'Leary said the delayed delivery of the planes will constrain capacity for passengers. He said that Ryanair's ticket prices could be up to 10% more expensive this summer as a result. Ryanair hopes to get some compensation, but is focused on getting planes delivered, Mr O'Leary added. He said that a delivery of 57 Boeing 737 Max 8200's was due by March, but the firm thinks only 40-45 may arrive in time for the summer season. Boeing has been facing scrutiny since an incident in January when a piece of one of its jets blew out during a passenger flight. The Alaska Airline passenger flight did not lead to serious injuries but forced an emergency landing. As a result, Mr O'Leary said, the US manufacturer had the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, \"crawling all over them\". Major concerns have been raised about quality control for new Boeing aircraft, sparking a slowdown in production speed. Mr O'Leary said costs saved through hedging on fuel would mean that Ryanair's fare increase would not be as steep as the 17% rise seen in 2023. Some other airlines also have capacity constraints caused by aircraft not being available, he added. A problem with Pratt & Whitney engines, for example, has grounded a number of Airbus planes used by carriers such as Wizz Air.  Mr O'Leary told reporters that there would be a \"higher fare environment across Europe\" this summer.  Ryanair's original forecast for the year to the end of March 2025 was that it would carry 205 million passengers, up from 183.5 million in the 12 months before. Speaking at the firm's Dublin headquarters, Mr O'Leary said: \"With less aircraft, maybe we'll have to bring that 205 million down towards 200 million passengers.\" \"If capacity was growing, I think fares would be falling,\" he added. Lucy Coutts, investment director at JM Finn, told the BBC's Today programme: \"Boeing itself has said there are going to be 9,000 fewer seats this summer available because of the delays at the company. \"Ryanair is a low-cost carrier and so its hikes of 10% are a little bit higher than the average at 3-7% but it is because it is coming from a low base.\" Discussing the issues that have engulfed the US plane maker Boeing, Mr O'Leary described the message he was currently getting from the firm as \"confusion\". The boss of the carrier has repeatedly backed Boeing's top management, but criticised the plane maker's quality control standards. He does not think the removal of the 737 Max programme's boss Ed Clark was the right move, arguing that having both a replacement for Mr Clark and a new president for quality did not make sense.  Ryanair, he said, wanted one person in charge who was monitoring the situation daily, having previously said their products were \"great aircraft, it's just that they're not making them on time or delivering them in time\". A spokesperson for Boeing said: \"We are communicating with customers that some delivery schedules may change as we take the necessary time to make sure that every airplane we deliver is high quality and meets all customer and regulatory requirements.  They added that they \"deeply regret the impact this is having on our valued customer Ryanair\".  \"We're working to address their concerns and taking action on a comprehensive plan to strengthen 737 quality and delivery performance.\"",

            "title": "Chinese visitors allegedly barred from Airbus German military plane",
            "text": "Visitors from China have claimed they were banned from a German military plane at a recent airshow, prompting an apology from manufacturer Airbus. The incident allegedly took place at the Singapore Airshow, one of the region's largest exhibitions of commercial and military aviation. The claims have gone viral on Chinese social media, sparking controversy. German officials have yet to comment. Airbus said it was sorry for \"any inconvenience caused\". In one widely-circulated video filmed by a Chinese blogger on the weekend, a woman wearing Airbus identification is seen asking him for his nationality.  The man was attempting to enter an Airbus A400M transport aircraft owned by the German air force, the Luftwaffe.  The woman tells him that she needs to check his nationality \"because it is a German aircraft\". When he tells her that he is Chinese, she immediately refuses him entry, saying \"it's German rules, it's military restrictions\". A BBC review found that several aspects of the video, including the planes seen in the background and the woman's ID, appeared genuine. Other Chinese visitors have also claimed online that they were not allowed on the plane.  Another blogger said he was chased away by German military staff, and that he had lodged an official complaint with the airshow's organisers alleging \"discrimination against Chinese people\". Commenters on Weibo pointed out that Chinese visitors were allowed to visit other countries' military aircraft, and lambasted Airbus and the German military. When approached by the BBC, a representative at the German embassy in Singapore referred reporters to Airbus as they were \"responsible for security and managing the entrance\" to the plane. He did not respond to questions about the allegations regarding German military staff. Airbus declined to comment on the video. But the European plane manufacturer told the BBC they were aware that some visitors at the Singapore Airshow had \"raised questions about access\" to the A400M plane.  \"We immediately communicated and coordinated with the customer and our Airbus teams at the show to ensure that the aircraft was open to all visitors for the remainder of the airshow. We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused,\" they said. Airbus posted a similar apology on its official Weibo account. The BBC has also contacted the airshow's organisers and the Chinese bloggers for comment. Airbus touts the A400M as the most advanced \"airlifter\" military transport plane available. It can deliver troops into small unprepared airstrips in the battlefield as well as send large equipment to bases, while also acting as a mid-air refuelling tanker. The incident comes amid increasing European concern of Chinese state access to Western military technology. The President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen last year warned against European technology enhancing China's military capacities. Additional reporting by Fan Wang.",

            "text": "Two very different flights in 24 hours, each with the same aim: to alleviate Gaza's suffering. The first is the less perilous: an Etihad Airways passenger plane, flight EY750 from Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates. The Boeing 777 has been converted into a virtual flying ambulance with seats in economy turned into hospital beds. Its mission, paid for by the government of the UAE, is to return civilians who had previously got out after being trapped in Rafah in southern Gaza, in some cases for months, and to evacuate wounded Palestinian children who had crossed from Gaza to al-Arish in Egypt's northern Sinai. After hours on the ground, the first evacuees start to make it on board. There is relief on their faces as they make it across the airfield to the plane, but uncertainty too. Many have left family members behind in Gaza. Among them is 58-year-old Hanaa Hasan Abu Namous. Her hand is badly injured. She says 25 members of her family were killed in an Israeli air strike on their home in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. \"During the war they were displaced,\" she tells me. \"Thirty or 50 of them would come to our house. We are civilians. We never have and never will fight.\" She holds a picture on her phone of shroud-wrapped bodies. They had to be buried together, four or five to a coffin, she says. Sitting a few rows forward is 13-year-old Yazan Wajih Barhum, whose left foot has been partially amputated. He was at a neighbour's house in Rafah when an Israeli bomb hit, he says. His seven-year-old brother, Yamen, was hit with shrapnel in the eye and is already in Abu Dhabi. When I ask him when they last saw each other he answers, quick as a flash, \"58 days ago\". What are his hopes for the future, I ask. \"To be able to walk on my legs again, get back to how I was, play football with my friends, and for the war to end so I can go back to my country\", he says. The crew on board, regular airline staff, hand the 25 injured children backpacks with games and a SpongeBob blanket. The kids who are able sit watching cartoons on the entertainment system; some are on stretchers at the back of the plane. Kiran Sadasivan, the cabin manager, welcomes the children and their chaperones on board, taking pictures with their phones and distributing meals. \"This is my tenth mission flight,\" he tells me. \"And I'll be on the next one in a few days.\" Also on board is Dr Maha Barakat, the UAE's assistant foreign affairs minister. A UK-trained doctor, she does not rest during the 20-hour evacuation mission, checking on the patients and medical team and liaising with the Egyptian authorities on the ground. \"The actual day today was clearly a more challenging day than usual,\" she says. \"There was a particular girl that we were trying to get through - she was in urgent medical need. And she wasn't able to make it to the border. However, we will have another plane coming in the next few days.\" Not all the Palestinians on the plane are leaving Gaza. Sitting alone, wearing a dark red headscarf and with a small leather handbag at her side is mother-of-three Zahra Mohammed Al-Qeiq. She has leukaemia, and left Gaza a few months ago for treatment in Abu Dhabi. Now she is returning to Rafah.  Isn't she scared, I ask her. \"The whole period I spent in the Emirates, my kids were crying on calls asking me to come back, saying 'come back; we will die in Gaza'. I had to stop my treatment and go back to my children,\" she says. Emirati doctors have given her six months of chemotherapy drugs. \"I cried every night I was away from home. I have to go back, they are my children,\" she says. Twenty-four hours later, a Royal Jordanian Airforce cargo plane - \"Guts Airline\" painted on its side - heads for Gaza at sunset. The aircrew on board have done this flight a dozen times. As they reach 17,000ft (5,200m), they put on oxygen masks and make final precise adjustments for the drop. For the first time, the cargo on board is British: four tonnes of supplies, including fuel, medical gear and food rations, to resupply the Jordanian-run field hospital in Gaza City. Until now Britain has only sent aid by land and sea, but northern Gaza has become almost entirely unreachable. The World Food Programme has suspended deliveries there because its convoys have endured \"complete chaos and violence\", it said. There is a heavy Israeli military presence on the ground. The Jordanian authorities will not disclose what co-ordination is made with Israel to allow the plane to fly overhead without incident. Israel maintains a tight grip on the aid going into Gaza. Britain and others have complained that only a fraction of the aid needed is making it into the strip. Everything is subject to stringent Israeli checks, to prevent supplies making it inside that would aid Hamas. Most of the people in this once densely packed part of Gaza have been driven out by Israeli forces, but some 300,000 remain, barely surviving in the most desperate of circumstances. The UN has been warning for months of the threat of famine in northern Gaza. I watch as the cargo doors opened and the first two pallets of supplies fly off into the black night. The plane banks sharply and turns, and the second two pallets are launched. The Jordanian crew give a thumbs-up and head for home. It is a small drop in the chasm of Gaza's need. But this aid sent into the night at least manages to get through; the crew confirms it has landed right on target.",

            "title": "Boeing safety checks to use 'more boots on ground'",
            "text": "The head of the US aviation regulator has said \"more boots on the ground\" will be used to step up safety checks on Boeing planes. Federal Aviation Administrator Mike Whitaker told US lawmakers on Tuesday that Boeing is being \"closely scrutinised\" after a door plug broke off one of its planes last month. No-one was seriously hurt in the mid-air blowout. But issues found in inspections since have raised questions about standards. Mr Whitaker told a congressional committee he would ensure aircraft manufacturer Boeing would be held accountable for any future failure or refusal to comply with the FAA. His comments came in the wake of last month's incident in which an unused door blew out of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max nine minutes after take-off from Portland International Airport. Although no-one was seriously hurt, the incident could have been much worse had it occurred later in the flight. Since then, loose bolts and fixings on other planes, revealed in aircraft inspections, have called into question Boeing's manufacturing standards. The airline manufacturer revealed this week that more defects had been found on parts of the fuselage - the main tube of the aircraft - which were sent to Boeing by its key supplier, Spirit AeroSystem. The FAA itself has faced criticism for allegedly failing to impose sufficient oversight on Boeing. Concerns were first raised in the aftermath of two catastrophic accidents affecting the 737 Max in late 2018 and early 2019, in which 346 people died. At the time, the aviation regulator was accused of allowing itself to be unduly influenced by the company it was supposed to be overseeing - so-called \"regulatory capture\". Last month's door blow-out has once again cast a spotlight on the work of the agency. Appearing before the House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee, Mr Whitaker said inspections of 737 Max aircraft had shown that \"the quality system issues at Boeing were unacceptable and require further scrutiny\". He pointed out that Boeing had already been prevented from expanding production of the 737 Max, and said the FAA had launched an investigation scrutinising Boeing's compliance with manufacturing requirements. Mr Whitaker added that the FAA was looking forward to the results of a comprehensive review of Boeing's safety culture being carried out by a panel including representatives of the FAA, labour unions, engineering experts and others. The FAA would \"follow the data and take appropriate and necessary action\", he said. \"Let me stress, the safety of the flying public is our mission,\" he concluded. Responding to questions from lawmakers, Mr Whitaker said the Alaska Airlines incident had created two issues for the regulator. \"The first is what's wrong with this plane? The second is what's going on with Boeing?\" he explained. \"They have had issues in the past, and they don't seem to be getting resolved.\" He said the FAA currently had about two dozen inspectors working in Boeing's factories, with another half a dozen at Spirit Aerosystems. However, he said no decision had been taken about the future of the ODA (Organisation Designation Authorisation), a system which allows Boeing to carry out some safety certification work itself on behalf of the regulator. In the past, this system has been described as Boeing \"marking its own homework\".",

            "text": "A door that blew away from a Boeing 737 Max shortly after take-off may not have been properly secured, a new report says. The US National Transportation Safety Board has released initial findings from its probe into the incident on an Alaska Airlines plane in January. It says four key bolts that were meant to lock the unused door to the fuselage appeared to be missing. Replying to the report, Boeing said it was accountable for what happened. In a statement, Boeing's president Dave Calhoun said: \"An event like this must not happen on an airplane that leaves our factory. We simply must do better for our customers and their passengers.\" \"We are implementing a comprehensive plan to strengthen quality and the confidence of our stakeholders,\" he added. The incident happened minutes after Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 took off, and involved a panel covering an unused emergency exit - known as a door plug. This suddenly blew out, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the main body of the aircraft, the fuselage. The missing bolts appeared to have allowed the door panel to move out of position and break away from the aircraft, the report says.  It happened just moments after the flight took off from Portland International Airport. The plane then suffered a rapid loss of cabin pressure, as air rushed out and the atmosphere within the plane equalised with the thinner air outside. The door plug was manufactured by Boeing's supplier Spirit AeroSystems, and originally installed in the fuselage before being delivered to the aerospace giant. According to the preliminary report, this door plug was later removed in the factory due to damage that had occurred during the production process. Photographic evidence suggests that when the plug was reinstalled, at least three of the four locking bolts were not put back in place. Damage to the door plug and its hinges, as well as a lack of damage to the areas where the bolts should have been, suggests that the bolts were missing before the door moved out of its normal position, the report said.  Spirit AeroSystems said it remain focused on working closely with Boeing and regulators \"on continuous improvement in our processes and meeting the highest standards of safety, quality and reliability\". The findings are likely to make uncomfortable reading for Boeing, which has already faced harsh criticism over its corporate culture and quality control processes. Inspections have already revealed loose bolts and fixings on other planes of the same specification, raising questions about the way they were built. However, the BBC understands with inspections into the in-service 737-9s almost complete, no models have been found to be missing any of the four retention bolts.  In his response, Boeing's president and chief executive said its improvement plan would \"take significant, demonstrated action and transparency at every turn\".  Mr Calhoun said the airline manufacturer would implement new inspections of door plug assembly and fully document when the plug is removed. Additional inspections into the supply chain and an independent assessment would also be included in the plans.  \"This added scrutiny - from ourselves, from our regulator and from our customers - will make us better. It's that simple,\" Mr Calhoun said. Prior to the Alaska Airlines incident, there had been other serious problems on the 737 Max production line, including the discovery of manufacturing defects affecting key parts of the planes, as well as a part protecting the central fuel tank against lightning strikes. The scrutiny is all the more intense because of the history of the 737 Max itself. The plane - a new version of Boeing's decades old workhorse - was involved in two major accidents in late 2018 and early 2019, in which 346 people were killed. Those crashes were attributed to badly-designed flight control software, which forced both aircraft into catastrophic dives that the pilots were powerless to prevent. In the aftermath, Boeing faced accusations from lawmakers and safety campaigners that it had put profits above the safety of passengers. Testifying before US lawmakers today, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Whitaker said inspections of 737 Max aircraft had shown that \"the quality system issues at Boeing were unacceptable and require further scrutiny\". He promised to put more \"boots on the ground\" in Boeing's factories in order to increase scrutiny of the manufacturer.  Boeing would be held accountable for any future failure or refusal to comply with the FAA, he added. Last month, Boeing's chief executive Dave Calhoun told staff at the company it would co-operate with investigators and regulators \"to ensure all the procedures are put into place, inspections, all the readiness actions that are required to ensure every next airplane that moves into the sky is in fact safe and that this event can never happen again\".",

            "text": "The boss of Emirates airline has warned Boeing is in the \"last chance saloon\", saying he had seen a \"progressive decline\" in its performance. Boeing has come under scrutiny after a panel on a 737 Max 9 passenger jet blew off mid-air last month. Emirates president Sir Tim Clark is a leading industry figure and the airline is a major Boeing customer. He also told the Financial Times that Emirates would send its engineers to monitor Boeing's production lines. In response to Sir Tim's remarks, Boeing pointed to comments its chief executive, Dave Calhoun, made last week, when he said: \"We understand why [customers] are angry and we will work to earn their confidence.\" Emirates told the BBC it had nothing to add to what Sir Tim said in the interview. \"They have got to instil this safety culture which is second to none. They've got to get their manufacturing processes under review so there are no corners cut etc,\" Sir Tim said. \"I'm sure Dave Calhoun and [commercial head] Stan Deal are on that... this is the last chance saloon,\" he added. Sir Tim was preparing to send Emirates engineers to monitor Boeing's production lines for the first time. He said the engineers would observe the production process of the 777 at Boeing and its supplier Spirit AeroSystems. Emirates is one of Boeing's biggest customers. In November, it placed an order for 95 wide-body Boeing 777 and 787 jets, used for long-haul flights, valued at $52bn (\u00a341.2bn) at list prices. But Boeing hit the headlines in recent weeks despite the Mr Calhoun insisting the company had changed since he took over after former boss Dennis Muilenburg was fired. On 5 January a door plug on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 blew off shortly after take-off, terrifying passengers, and forcing an emergency return to the Portland, Oregon airport. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) launched an investigation of Boeing's manufacturing process and barred the firm from expanding production of its popular 737 Max planes. Some of the company's biggest airline customers have also expressed concerns, noting that the issues may delay approval of new versions of the 737 Max plane, the Max 7 and Max 10, that are in the works. In 2018, a similar incident to what happened last month occurred to an older model of Boeing 737 being operated by Southwest Airlines. Debris from an engine failure broke one of the cabin windows while the plane was travelling at 32,000ft. It resulted in one passenger being partially sucked out of the window and she died from her injuries. The company's safety record has also been tarnished due to two crashes in late 2018 off the coast of Indonesia and in early 2019 outside Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa. A total of 346 people were killed in the crashes, which were caused by flawed flight control software.",

It is unclear whether the cuts will have any impact on local suppliers. The move concerns the Airbus A220 because Spirit, a US-based company, makes the wings for that plane in Belfast. Airbus and Spirit are currently renegotiating financial terms for the A220 work. Speaking on Tuesday, Spirit's chief executive, Patrick Shanahan, said: \"The negotiations with Airbus continue and have been productive.  \"We hope to conclude by February, but we need to ensure all items are addressed.  \"We are converging on operational and financial solutions.\" Spirit has been in Northern Ireland since 2019 when it bought Bombardier's operations. The deal ended a long period of uncertainty for about 3,000 workers in Northern Ireland. Mr Shanahan told financial analysts that the firm was looking at cost savings from work coming out of the old Bombardier supply chain and going to Airbus suppliers. \"We've jointly evaluated those costs, and Airbus has a significant history with those suppliers. So I feel confident in that cost basis,\" he added. He was speaking as the firm reported financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024 which included another $58m (\u00a346m) of losses related to the A220. Spirit's US operation is the major supplier to the troubled Boeing 737 Max.  The company said it would not be providing investors with financial forecasts for the year ahead until there is clarity from regulators about when Boeing will be allowed to increase the production rate of the 737 Max.",

            "text": "Boeing faces a \"serious challenge\" and uncertain outlook as it seeks to restore confidence, its boss Dave Calhoun admitted, announcing the firm's latest financial results on Wednesday. Trust in the firm has been shaken since a panel of one of its 737 Max 9 jets broke off in mid-air. The incident has renewed questions five years after two fatal accidents on another version of its planes. Mr Calhoun has been trying to show the firm is taking the situation seriously. On a call with financial analysts, he apologised and said the company took responsibility, no matter what the ongoing formal investigation into what caused it concluded.  \"We caused the problem and we understand that,\" he said. \"We simply must do better.\" The quarterly update to investors is the company's first since the accident on the Alaska Airlines flight, which terrified passengers and forced an emergency return to the Portland, Oregon airport that occurred without serious injury.   Mr Calhoun has previously blamed it on a \"quality escape\". Reports suggest that the panel was improperly installed when the plane left Boeing's factory.  It has prompted new scrutiny of the company's manufacturing record, which critics say has suffered as the firm pushed to cut costs and speed deliveries. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has launched an investigation of Boeing's manufacturing process and barred the firm from expanding production of its popular 737 Max planes.  Some of the company's biggest airline customers have also expressed concerns, noting that the issues may delay approval of new versions of the 737 Max plane, the Max 7 and Max 10, that are in the works. Mr Calhoun said the company would defer to regulators.  \"I know these moments that can impact delivery schedules can frustrate our customers and investors but quality and safety must come before all else,\" he said. \"We are going to go slow to go fast and we will encourage and reward employees for speaking up to slow things down if that's what needed,\" he said. On the call with investors, Mr Calhoun limited his prepared remarks to the company's response to the Alaska Airlines emergency. The company also said it would not offer formal financial guidance for the 2024 year.  \"While we often use this time of year to share or update our financial and operational objectives, now is not the time for that,\" Mr Calhoun wrote in a letter to staff that accompanied the results.   Analysts pressed Mr Calhoun about what the turmoil would mean for the company in the years ahead, with one questioning how the lapse could have occurred after the spotlight that was cast on the company after crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving another version of its 737 Max plane killed 346 people. The issues have hit the company's shares which tumbled 20% at one point.  The Rhode Island treasurer on Tuesday filed a proposed class-action lawsuit on behalf of shareholders, accusing the company of continuing to prioritise \"profits over safety\" after those accidents, despite public promises to the contrary.  Boeing declined to comment on the lawsuit. Among airline safety campaigners, the emergency has sparked calls for new leadership and the ouster of Mr Calhoun, who has served on the board since 2009 and was installed as chief executive after the earlier crashes. \"They had their chance. They failed. They are unable or unwilling to do the task and should leave,\" said Michael Stumo, whose daughter was killed in the Ethiopia Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 crash and has now become a vocal airline safety advocate. The investor update for the September to December period showed the manufacturing giant was currently producing 737 planes at a rate of 38 a month. Revenue rose 10% to $22bn, while the company's losses in the quarter narrowed to $283m.",

            "text": "Alaska Airlines says it is facing a $150m (\u00a3118m) hit, after the dramatic mid-air blowout of a panel on one of its planes this month.  The 5 Jan incident on a Boeing 737 Max 9 plane terrified passengers and prompted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ground 171 jets with similar designs. Alaska had to cancel more than 3,000 flights in the wake of the incident. It said it expected its travel to return to normal by early next month.  But it warned that growth would be lower than expected in the months ahead, as deliveries of new Boeing aircraft are likely delayed.  The FAA on Wednesday said the grounded Boeing planes could return to service if they have been inspected. But Boeing's output has been capped, while the FAA investigates its manufacturing. The troubles at the company, one of the world's two major plane-makers, are now spilling over to the rest of the industry.  United Airlines, another major 737 Max 9 customer, earlier this week said it was braced for delays in deliveries and looking at alternatives to Boeing as it plotted out aircraft orders.  It warned investors that it would lose money in the first quarter due to the incident. Executives at Southwest and American, which are also reporting earnings this week, have also echoed the concerns about delayed aircraft and frustration with Boeing. \"Boeing needs to get their act together,\" American Airlines chief executive Robert Isom said.  Boeing for its part, has apologised for the disruption and pledged to work transparently and cooperatively with regulators.  Alaska Airlines had also faced questions from passengers, after it was revealed that the airline had restricted the jet involved in the accident from certain routes due to a pressure issue.  Chief executive Ben Minicucci said the problem was \"totally unrelated\". Speaking to financial analysts, he said passengers should feel confident in the safety of flying on its planes.  Mr Minicucci said he was having \"tough\" conversations with Boeing and would hold its \"feet to the fire\", but did not go so far as to threaten to cancel orders.  \"We have a longstanding deep relationship,\" he said, noting that the company had been happy with the planes in the past.  Boeing has been struggling with a spate of smaller manufacturing issues in recent years, while trying to repair its reputation after fatal accidents in 2018 and 2019 - involving a different version of the 737 Max - killed 346 people. Robert Mann, president of RW Mann & Company, an airline analysis and consulting firm in New York, said airlines used to have staff on hand to oversee more of the manufacturing process, but that they had scrapped that practice in recent decades in a drive to cut costs. \"As upset as these airlines are - and you can understand why they would be - they don't exactly have clean hands,\" he said.  Now, with the industry dominated by just two big players - Boeing and European rival Airbus - they are in \"a bit of a box\", he added.  They don't \"really have any alternative as a practical matter,\" he said. ",

            "text": "The head of Boeing is facing questions from lawmakers in Washington as pressure mounts to explain the mistakes that led to a panel breaking off one of its planes this month. Boss Dave Calhoun told reporters ahead of the meetings that he was prepared to share \"everything I can\". But he declined to comment on a report that said the part had been improperly installed at one of the firm's plants. The anonymous account was posted online and reported by the Seattle Times. The post, from someone claiming to work at Boeing, described the production of Boeing's 737 planes as \"a rambling, shambling, disaster waiting to happen\". It said the firm's records showed that the four bolts meant to hold the door plug in place were not installed when Boeing delivered the 737 Max 9 plane to customer Alaska Airlines. On 5 Jan, just eight weeks later, the panel blew off shortly after take-off, terrifying passengers, and forcing an emergency return to the Portland, Oregon airport.  No serious injuries were reported but lawsuits have been filed by customers since the incident, accusing the company of negligence. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has grounded 171 other 737 Max 9 planes with similar designs for inspection, forcing the cancellation of thousands of flights.  It also recently recommended airlines inspect Boeing's older 737-900ER models, which use the same door design as Max 9s, though it did not order the planes out of service.  The whistleblower account said Boeing should have halted 737 manufacturing due to an \"alarming\" number of issues surfacing on the planes during inspections. In the case of this particular plane, it said Boeing and Spirit staff at a Boeing factory in Washington worked to identify and repair issues ahead of the delivery. The whistleblower says that in the course of that work, the bolts were removed. But according to the post, a final inspection of the door never occurred, which the account blames on a breakdown in communication, in part due to Boeing's use of two different computer systems to report and sign-off on issues.  Boeing staff were the ones who removed the bolts, according to The Seattle Times, which said the information was from a different anonymous source.  Mr Calhoun referred questions to the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident.  Leaders at Alaska Airlines and United Airlines, which have two of the biggest 737 Max 9 fleets, have expressed major frustration with Boeing as the groundings create chaos and added costs.  In an interview with NBC News, Alaska Airlines boss Ben Minicucci said there was \"no doubt\" that the aeroplane came \"off the production line with a faulty door\". He said airline inspections since the incident found \"many\" loose bolts. \"I'm more than frustrated and disappointed,\" he said. \"I am angry.\" The comments underscore the difficult task ahead of Boeing to restore confidence among its airline customers and the flying public, which had already been shaken after fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving its planes killed 346 people. The FAA is currently investigating Boeing's manufacturing process and reviewing its current system for approving planes, which delegates some of those powers to Boeing.  Online travel agent Kayak recently reported that searches from users trying to avoid Boeing 737 Max planes had jumped 15-fold since the accident.  Mr Calhoun told reporters that he recognised the seriousness of the concerns. \"We fly safe planes - we don't put [aeroplanes] in the air we don't have 100% confidence in,\" he said. \"I'm here today in the spirit of transparency.\" The incident has drawn attention to other issues cropping up on Boeing planes, including the nose wheel of a different Boeing plane model, a 757, which popped off as it was lining up for takeoff in the US on Saturday.  None of the 184 passengers or six crew members were hurt when the wheel fell off the Delta Air Lines flight from Atlanta and rolled down a hill, the FAA said in a notice. The plane had been scheduled to fly to Bogota in Colombia, and passengers were put on a replacement flight, Delta Air Lines said. It apologised to customers, and said the \"event remains under investigation\". Boeing, which ended 757 deliveries in 2004, declined to comment on the incident. Responding to the ongoing situation with Max 9s, Boeing's Stan Deal, its chief executive of commercial aeroplanes, said the plane maker had \"let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers\". A spokesman said the firm had \"announced a series of immediate actions to strengthen quality\" including more inspections. Boeing has also named a retired US Navy admiral, Kirkland H. Donald, to lead a comprehensive quality review of its commercial aeroplane operation.",

            "text": "A major US airline has said it expects to lose money in the three months between January and March due to the grounding of Boeing 737 Max 9 jets. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded 171 of them after an unused door broke away mid-flight. United Airlines has 79 of the aircraft in its fleet, more than any other carrier, followed by Alaska Airlines. Both airlines have been forced to cancel hundreds of flights this month as inspections are carried out. United has said it expects the planes to remain grounded until 26 January and its forecast assumes it won't be able to fly them at all this month. The issues at Boeing, which is now facing government investigations of its manufacturing process, have also scrambled United's efforts to expand its fleet.  It warned investors on Tuesday that deliveries of dozens of new Boeing planes, including 737 Max 9s and a not yet approved Max 10, will be delayed. Chief executive Scott Kirby told analysts the firm has not cancelled its orders with Boeing but was considering alternatives. In an interview with CNBC, he called the latest grounding the \"straw that broke the camel's back\". Boeing has been struggling to restore confidence since fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving another version of its 737 Max plane that led to a global grounding for more than 18 months. Smaller manufacturing issues have cropped up repeatedly since production restarted.  Stan Deal, head of Boeing's commercial airplanes division, said the firm had \"let down\" its customers and was \"deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers\". \"We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance,\" he said.  The Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to Ontario, California, had reached 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began its emergency descent, according to flight tracking data, after the unused emergency exit door blew out. On Sunday, the FAA said another, older 737-900ER model should also be inspected as they use the same door design. United has 136 of these jets in its fleet. The FAA did not order the older model to be grounded while the visual inspections are carried out by operators. In the wake of the incident, Boeing said it would increase inspections and bring in an outside expert to review its processes, among other measures. ",

            "text": "Ryanair has cut its profit expectations for the year to the end of March, after some online travel agents stopped selling its flights.  The airline reduced fares to fill seats in December after it said sites including Booking.com, Kiwi and Kayak suddenly removed its flights.  Ryanair said it expected profits of up to \u20ac1.95bn (\u00a31.7bn), down from its forecast of up to \u20ac2.05bn in November.  A sharp increase in the airline's fuel bill has also hit profits.  In the October to December quarter, its fuel costs jumped 35% to \u20ac1.2bn. In January, Ryanair hit out against a number of online travel agents, including Booking.com, Kiwi and Kayak, after it said its flights had been suddenly removed from their websites.  Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers has been in a long-running dispute with online booking sites, after the airline launched legal action in the US against Booking.com owner Booking Holdings and its subsidiaries including Kayak, Agoda and Priceline. It followed an Irish High Court ruling which banned screenscraper Flightbox from gathering Ryanair flight information for online travel agents. The airline said the removal of its flights from the websites would increase the number of empty seats on its planes in the short term, and it dropped its direct booking prices in response.  In its latest set of results, Ryanair predicted an after-tax profit of between \u20ac1.85bn and \u20ac1.95bn for the year to the end of March, lower than a forecast of between \u20ac1.85bn and \u20ac2.05bn it made in November.  It said its revenue per paying passenger had been weaker than the previous year, blaming it on the removal of flights from online travel agents, despite its passenger numbers and fares being higher.  However, the airline's chief financial officer, Neil Sorahan, told the Reuters news agency that the impact of being removed from some online agents' sites would be temporary and was already beginning to \"fizzle out\". The after-tax figure would still beat its previous record annual after-tax profit of \u20ac1.45bn in 2018, and follows a boom in profits for the airline in November, after the airline hiked prices. Ryanair said passenger numbers had risen 11% to a record 105.4 million in the six months to September, despite average fares rising by 24%. The airline warned that the possibility of further delays in the delivery of new, more fuel-efficient Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft could also affect profits.  It also added that its full-year result remained heavily dependent on \"avoiding unforeseen adverse events (such as the Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas conflict)\".",

            "text": "Checks are to be carried out on a second Boeing aircraft model following the blowout of an unused door on one of its planes earlier this month. The US Federal Aviation Administration grounded more than 170 of the 737 Max 9 fleet after a cabin panel broke away thousands of feet above the ground. On Sunday, the agency said airlines should also inspect older 737-900ER models, which use the same door design. The FAA described the move as an \"added layer of safety\". It said there had been no reported issues with the 737-900ER, but that it uses the same style of panel to \"plug\" an unused door as the plane involved in the terrifying 5 January incident.  An Alaska Airlines flight en route to California from Portland, Oregon was forced to make an emergency landing after the panel came away, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the aircraft. The incident prompted the FAA to ground all 737 Max 9s featuring that style of panel and sent Boeing's share price tumbling. The agency is investigating the firm's manufacturing practices and production lines, including those linked to subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems, which provided the panel. Earlier this week, the FAA said it had carried out inspections on 40 of the grounded planes but did not say when they would be able to fly again. In a statement on Sunday, the agency said: \"The safety of the flying public, not speed, will determine the timeline for returning these aircraft to service.\" Boeing has said it will increase the quality of inspections in its manufacturing process in wake of the incident. The 737-900ER models have carried out 11 million hours of operations without similar incident to the newer 737 Max 9s. The FAA did not order the older model to be grounded while the visual inspections are carried out by operators. ",

            "text": "The US aviation regulator says it will allow Boeing's 737 Max 9 jets to resume flying after inspections are completed. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded 171 of the planes after an unused door broke away mid-flight. United Airlines and Alaska Airlines plan to start returning the jets to service in the coming days. But the FAA says it will not yet allow Boeing to expand production of its best-selling narrow body family of jets, which includes the 737 Max 9. The unprecedented decision by the regulator marks more bad news for the plane making giant. \"This won't be back to business as usual for Boeing,\" FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement. \"We will not agree to any request from Boeing for an expansion in production or approve additional production lines for the 737 Max until we are satisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved,\" he added. The announcement that the planes will be allowed to fly again once inspections have been completed is welcome news for Alaska Airlines and United Airlines, which had to cancel thousands of flights. Alaska Airlines said it expects \"to bring our first few planes back into scheduled commercial service on Friday\", with more planes added every day as inspections are completed. United Airlines said it had received final approval from the FAA to complete the process of returning its 79-strong fleet of 737 Max 9 planes to service. The company's chief operations officer Toby Enqvist said the airline was preparing to start flying the aircraft again from 28 January.  On 5 January a door plug on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 blew off shortly after take-off, terrifying passengers, and forcing an emergency return to the Portland, Oregon airport. Bosses of both Alaska Airlines and United Airlines have expressed frustration with Boeing over the grounding of the 737 Max 9, which has caused major disruptions to their services. In an interview with NBC News, Alaska Airlines boss Ben Minicucci said there was \"no doubt\" that the plane came \"off the production line with a faulty door\". He said airline inspections since the incident found \"many\" loose bolts. \"I'm more than frustrated and disappointed,\" he said. \"I am angry.\" United Airlines chief executive, Scott Kirby, also told CNBC that he is \"disappointed\". \"The Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel's back for us,\" he said, adding that \"we're going to build a plan that doesn't have the [Boeing] Max 10 in it\". United also said earlier this week that it expected to lose money because of the grounding. On Wednesday, the head of Boeing, David Calhoun, faced questions from lawmakers in Washington to explain what led to the mid-air emergency. The latest incident raises fresh questions about the safety of Boeing's aircraft. The company faced intense scrutiny after two fatal crashes of 737 Max 8 passenger jets in 2018 and 2019, which killed 346 people.",

            "text": "US officials said they have completed inspections of a first batch of Boeing planes, which were grounded for safety review after a cabin panel broke off one of the firm's jets mid-flight.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered 171 Boeing planes out of service after the 5 Jan incident. It said it had finished 40 inspections but offered no further update on when the jets might be cleared to fly. Airlines had said preliminary reviews revealed issues such as loose bolts.   Alaska Airlines and United, the two airlines with most of the affected planes, have had to cancel hundreds of flights since the planes were ordered out of service. The FAA said on Wednesday that officials will review the findings to determine if the maintenance and inspection conducted on the first batch of planes is adequate.  Once that process has been approved, it will be required on every grounded plane before being cleared for flight, the agency said.  The update comes as pressure grows on Boeing and the FAA to answer for the emergency on the Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to California, in which a cabin panel blew out shortly after take-off. Passengers on the plane, which returned to the airport without serious injury, have filed two lawsuits. saying the incident led to intense fear and trauma and alleging that not all of the air masks on the flight were functioning.  \"Mom ... We're in masks. I love you,\" one passenger texted at the time, according to one of the complaints, which accuses Boeing and Alaska Airlines of negligence.  The FAA said last week that it was expanding its review of Boeing's manufacturing processes and production lines, including for its troubled supplier Spirit Aerosystems.  It also said it would examine potential changes to the current controversial quality review system, in which the regulator delegates many of its responsibilities to Boeing staff, should be changed.  Senator Maria Cantwell, who represents Washington, the historic base of Boeing's operations, last week sought documents from the agency, saying it appeared the FAA's oversight processes had \"not been effective in ensuring that Boeing produces airplanes that are in condition for safe operation\". Boeing has been trying to repair its reputation since two of its 737 Max planes crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people.  Poor design of a piece of its flight control system was found to play a role, and authorities grounded its popular 737 Max planes globally for more than 18 months. Lax oversight by the FAA was also faulted. Boeing has reported a string of smaller manufacturing issues as production resumed. In a further embarrassment, the Boeing plane intended to transport US Secretary of State Antony Blinken from Davos to Washington was barred from take-off on Wednesday, after suffering what was described to reporters as \"a critical failure related to an oxygen leak\". Boeing said this week that an outside party would be brought in to assess its production practices, with Boeing commercial airplanes president and CEO Stan Deal saying the company was \"not where we need to be\".",

            "text": "Boeing has asked Ryanair to send extra engineers to oversee quality checks of its planes \"on the ground\" following the Alaska Airlines incident. Ryanair's boss told the BBC that quality was improving but the incident had shown there was \"more to be done\". It comes after an unused door fell off a Boeing 737 Max 9 operated by US-based Alaska Airlines. Ryanair does not use Boeing's 737 Max 9 aircraft but operates the Max 8 variant and has Max 10s on order.   The airline is one of Boeing's biggest customers for the 737 Max family, with more than 100 in service and due to have some 400 more by 2034. Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said that he expects delivery delays to affect its capacity. Asked in an interview with the BBC if he had complete confidence in Boeing's quality control processes after the incident which saw an unused door fall off, the Ryanair boss said \"no\". But he added that his airline did now have \"more confidence\" in plane maker Boeing. Mr O'Leary also said that a delivery of 12 planes towards the end of last year had been \"in terms of defects the best deliveries we've had in three years\". He acknowledged what happened with the Alaska Airlines flight had been serious but said the industry always learned from incidents. Ryanair will deploy more engineers to oversee quality control at US factories in Seattle and Wichita building aircraft and fuselages for the airline. Mr O'Leary said that Boeing made good planes, but compared the relationship to a marriage: \"I can be in love with you and still occasionally criticise some of your personal habits. I think that's the same with Boeing.\" He suggested that the management team at Boeing \"needs to be improved\" following the incident, although he gave his support for Boeing's current chief executive David Calhoun, stating that he is \"doing a stellar job in very tough circumstances\". Mr O'Leary added: \"We don't need more senior management changes in Boeing.\"  On Monday, Boeing announced that an outside party would also be brought in to assess its production practices. It will also check the work of the firm that supplies and installs the parts involved in the accident. Last week, the US regulator extended the grounding of 737 Max's with similar fuselage panels, while United and Alaska Airlines have said they were extending the cancellations of any flights involving the 737 Max 9 through until Wednesday. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also said it would conduct an audit of the plane's production line, adding it believed there were \"significant problems\" with the 737 Max 9 jet as well as \"other manufacturing problems\". Announcing the latest measures, Stan Deal, who heads up Boeing's commercial division, said the company was \"not where we need to be\". Scrutiny of Boeing has been renewed after the blowout on the Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to California, which forced an emergency landing but resulted in no serious injuries. The US aerospace giant has been struggling to restore confidence after crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving a different plane in the 737 Max group killed 346 people. Poor design of a piece of its flight control system was found to play a role in those crashes, and authorities grounded its popular 737 Max planes globally for more than 18 months. Poor oversight by the FAA was also cited. On Tuesday, Boeing also announced that it had appointed Kirkland H. Donald, a former Navy admiral, as the independent advisor responsible for overseeing a review of its quality control systems for its commercial aircraft. He and a range of experts will provide Boeing bosses, including Mr Calhoun, with a series of recommendations.",

            "text": "A domestic All Nippon Airways (ANA) flight in Japan has returned to its departure airport after a crack was reported on the cockpit window during the flight. The crack appeared in the outermost of the four layers of window surrounding the cockpit. There were no injuries to anyone on board.  ANA flight NH1182 was flying from the city of Sapporo in Hokkaido to Toyama, on Japan's main island, Honshu. The plane, a Boeing 737, landed back at Sapporo's New Chitose airport at around 12:10 local time (3:10 GMT). A spokesperson for ANA, Japan's largest carrier, said that the crack had been found as the flight passed over Hakodate.  \"The crack was not something that affected the flight's control or pressurisation,\" the spokesperson said. The plane headed back to the airport where a safe landing was carried out.  Aviation expert John Strickland said the cause of the crack was still unknown. \"These things do sometimes happen, something may have struck the window, for example a bird, a large hailstone, it's not unheard of\". \"You might occasionally get a stress fracture too, from wear and tear,\" he added, \"but that's very rare\". He said the airline would likely have to replace the whole window, not just the broken layer, to make sure the aircraft was completely safe. \"These things do happen, it's impossible to quantify how frequently\".  There were 59 passengers and six crew members on board. Alternative flights were arranged for the passengers. This is the second incident involving a Boeing 737 model aircraft in as many weeks. However the ANA flight was not one of Boeing's 737 Max 9 airplanes, but an earlier version which was \"by no means old\", Mr Strickland said. All Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft have been grounded by the US aviation regulator the FAA after an Alaska Airlines plane suffered a blowout that saw a cabin panel fall off a new plane in mid air, leaving a gaping hole in the side of its fuselage last week. That plane, carrying 177 passengers and crew, had to make an emergency landing in the US state of Oregon. On Friday the FAA extended the grounding of Boeing 737 Max 9 planes indefinitely for further safety checks and said it would tighten oversight of Boeing itself. The FAA said the 171 planes with the same configuration as the one in the incident had to stay grounded \"for the safety of American travellers\".",

The head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said he believed there were \"significant problems\" with the 737 Max 9 jet as well as \"other manufacturing problems\". The FAA said it would conduct an audit of the plane's production line. It also plans to review who is in charge of quality oversight.  For years, the FAA has delegated some parts of quality reviewing of planes to Boeing, but the practice has been controversial, drawing repeated warnings of safety risks.  \"It is time to re-examine the delegation of authority and assess any associated safety risks,\" FAA administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement.  \"The grounding of the 737-9 and the multiple production-related issues identified in recent years require us to look at every option to reduce risk. The FAA is exploring the use of an independent third party to oversee Boeing's inspections and its quality system.\" Boeing did not immediately comment. The US aerospace giant has been struggling to restore confidence after crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving a different plane in the 737 Max group killed 346 people.  Poor design of a piece of its flight control system was found to play a role, and authorities grounded its popular 737 Max planes globally for more than 18 months. Lax oversight by the FAA was also faulted.  Boeing has reported a string of smaller manufacturing issues as production resumed. The blowout on the Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to California, which forced an emergency landing but resulted in no serious injuries, has revived scrutiny. Passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight have filed a class action lawsuit against Boeing. Their lawyers described the incident as a \"nightmare experience\" that had caused \"economic, physical and ongoing emotional consequences that have understandably deeply affected our clients\".  Mark Pegram, the father of Sam Pegram, an aid worker who died in the Ethiopian Airlines 2019 crash, said the emergency should make the government reconsider the deal it made with Boeing after the the earlier fatal accidents, in which the firm paid $2.5bn but may see its criminal charge dropped. He also called for an independent industry monitor. \"The need for this independent oversight is even more necessary now when one considers the ineptness of the FAA which has failed again to properly oversee Boeing's Max aircraft production, as evidenced by these latest near catastrophes,\" he said. \"The lives of passengers should not needlessly, and once again, be put at risk.\" The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating what happened on the Alaska Airlines plane, which had been in service for just eight weeks. On Thursday, the FAA formally announced an inquiry into Boeing's processes.  It has also grounded 171 planes - most of the 737 Max 9 fleet - with similar door plugs for inspections, which have revealed loose bolts and other issues.  Boeing has said it will cooperate fully and transparently with the probes. Supplier Spirit Aerosystems is also involved.   Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun has already said the company will admit its \"mistake\" and has described the issue as a \"quality escape\".

            "text": "Airline regulators in the US have formally launched an investigation of Boeing's processes, after a door plug blew off one of its planes. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would examine whether Boeing failed to ensure its completed jets matched their approved design.  The FAA had already grounded most of the 737 Max 9 fleet for inspection. The reviews after the emergency on the Alaska Airlines flight have uncovered issues such as loose bolts. \"This incident should have never happened and it cannot happen again,\" the FAA said. \"Boeing's manufacturing practices need to comply with the high safety standards they're legally accountable to meet.\"  Boeing said it would \"cooperate full and transparently\" with the investigation.  Company boss, Dave Calhoun, had previously described the problem as a \"quality escape\". It means the incident was caused by some failure in quality control in the plane, which had been in service for just eight weeks before the blowout. He told CNBC there were still questions that needed to be answered about how the incident was allowed to happen.  \"What broke down in our gauntlet of inspections? What broke down in the original work that allowed for that escape to happen,\" he said. The door plug is a piece of fuselage, with a window, that fills the space where an emergency exit would be in certain configurations. The part broke off a Boeing 737 Max 9 jet that was operated by Alaska Airlines minutes after its take-off from Portland, Oregon on Friday.  No serious injuries were reported after an emergency return to the airport but the FAA on Saturday grounded 171 planes that had the same door plug installed.  It is unclear when the planes will be allowed to fly again.  Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has said the government would not be rushed into clearing the grounded planes, despite hundreds of flight cancellations.  He said the aircraft \"need to be 100% safe\".  \"The only consideration on the timeline is safety,\" he said. \"Until it is ready, it is not ready. Nobody can or should be rushed in that process.\" Alaska Airlines has cancelled about 20% of its flights after 65 of its Max 9s were grounded. United Airlines, the other major US 737 MAX 9 operator, has 79 of the planes in its fleet out of action. It said it expects \"significant\" cancellations on Thursday after 167 flights did not go ahead on Wednesday. Alaska Airlines said it still needed revised inspection and maintenance instructions from Boeing, which must be approved by the FAA before it can begin flying the planes again. \"We will only return these aircraft to service when all findings have been fully resolved and meet all FAA and Alaska's stringent standards,\" the airline said. Both Alaska and United said on Monday they had found loose parts on a number of the grounded aircraft. The part which fell off was eventually found in a teacher's back garden without its four bolts. Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating what happened on the flight, said on Monday it was possible the bolts were missing from the start but they might have come off in the descent. The incident has revived scrutiny of Boeing, which has been trying to repair its reputation after crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving a different version of the 737 Max plane killed 346 people.  Its popular 737 Max planes were subsequently grounded globally for more than 18 months. It has reported a string of smaller issues as production resumed. ",

            "text": "A US-bound ANA flight was forced to return to Tokyo after an intoxicated passenger bit a crew member mid-flight. The man, reportedly a 55-year-old American, was \"heavily drunk\" when he bit a cabinet attendant's arm, slightly injuring her, a spokesman for the airline told AFP. Japanese media said the man told police he had taken a sleeping pill and did not remember what happened.  It is the latest in a series of recent incidents to affect Japanese aviation. The plane, which reportedly had 159 passengers on board, was over the Pacific Ocean when the incident happened, prompting its pilots to turn back to Tokyo's Haneda Airport.  There the man was handed over to police, the airline said.  It is the second incident to impact ANA in recent days - and the fifth involving the Japanese aviation industry in a matter of weeks.  On Saturday, a domestic ANA flight in Japan had to turn back after a crack was discovered in the window of the cockpit.  The crack appeared in the outermost of the four layers of window surrounding the cockpit, and there were no injuries to anyone on board.  \"The crack was not something that affected the flight's control or pressurisation,\" an ANA spokesperson said.  The most serious of the recent incidents occurred at Haneda on 2 January, when a Japanese Airlines aircraft collided with a smaller coastguard plane.  All 379 people on board the passenger jet escaped before it burst into flames, but five of the six people on the smaller aircraft - which was supplying relief after a major earthquake hit central Japan - died.  On Tuesday, aircraft belonging to Korean Air and Cathay Pacific clipped wings at an airport on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido amid wintry conditions. There were no injuries.  A similar incident occurred on Sunday when an ANA aircraft came into \"contact\" with a Delta Air Lines plane at Chicago airport in the United States, the Japanese airline told AFP, also causing no injuries.",

            "text": "The boss of Boeing has admitted the planemaker was at fault after one of its aircraft suffered a door blowout shortly after take-off in the US.  No-one was injured when the unused cabin door broke away from the Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon on Friday. The US has grounded 171 of the Boeing 737 Max 9 planes since the incident.  On Tuesday, Boeing's president and chief executive Dave Calhoun said the firm was \"acknowledging our mistake\". The door \"plug\" which fell away from the aircraft weighed 27kg (60lb) and was used to fill an emergency exit that was built into the plane, but not required by Alaska Airlines.  The missing section of the plane was retrieved from the back garden of a Portland teacher, according to the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). It has also been revealed that the airline placed restrictions on the aircraft following pressurisation warnings in the days before the incident, investigators have said. Speaking to Boeing staff, Mr Calhoun said: \"We're going to approach this number one acknowledging our mistake. We're going to approach it with 100% and complete transparency every step of the way.\" Mr Calhoun reassured staff that Boeing would work with the NTSB to investigate the cause of the accident.  \"They will get to a conclusion\u2026 the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] who has to now deal with airline customers who want airplanes back in service safely and to ensure all the procedures are put into place, inspections, all the readiness actions that are required to ensure every next airplane that moves into the sky is in fact safe and that this event can never happen again,\" he said. The Boeing boss also empathised with those who watched with horror at the footage of the incident: \"When I got that picture, all I could think about - I didn't know what happened so whoever was supposed to be in the seat next to that hole in the airplane. I've got kids, I've got grandkids and so do you. This stuff matters. Every detail matters.\" Inspections of Boeing 737 Max 9's are continuing after the FAA said its first priority was \"keeping the flying public safe\".",

            "text": "\"I see greatness in this company, but I also see opportunities to do better. Much better.\" These were the words of Boeing chief executive David Calhoun on his first day in the job, back in January 2020. He was appointed in the aftermath of two tragic crashes involving Boeing's newest and fastest selling airliner, the 737 Max, in which 346 people died. Four years later, Boeing is facing an investigation from the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, for potentially having failed to ensure its aircraft \"were in a condition for safe operation\". The company will also be subjected to increased oversight and new safety assessments, following a clampdown announced by the new head of the FAA, Mike Whitaker. The credibility of the aerospace giant, and its boss, are on the line following another serious incident involving an airliner from the 737 Max family.  No-one was seriously hurt when an unused door blew off an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 last week shortly after take-off. But it could have been much, much worse. Inspections have already revealed loose bolts and fixings on other planes of the same specification - raising questions about the way they were built. Mr Calhoun told staff this week that Boeing would acknowledge its \"mistake\" and would approach the investigation with \"100% and complete transparency\". That mistake has cast a harsh spotlight on Boeing's commitment to safety and the performance of the 737 Max itself. In commercial terms, the aircraft has been a clear success. Some 1,370 have been delivered to customers so far, and another 4,300 are on order. Flight 1282: The Blowout Every passenger's worst nightmare: the terrifying moment a plane door rips away mid-air. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) The aircraft is popular with airlines because it is much more efficient than the previous generation of 737, has low running costs, and offers an alternative to Airbus's rival A320 neo. But behind the scenes, there have been serious problems, including manufacturing defects affecting parts of the fuselage, tail and rudder assembly, as well as sealants applied as protection against the effect of lightning strikes in the central fuel tank.  Some of these flaws were attributed to Boeing's supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. The Kansas-based company builds major parts for the 737 Max, including fuselages. It also produced the door that fell off the Alaska Airlines plane. A shareholder lawsuit lodged late last year accused the company of deliberately attempting to cover up serious defects. Spirit says it \"strongly disagrees\" with those assertions and insists it will \"vigorously\" defend itself against the claims. \"Ultimately, the buck stops with Boeing,\" says Bjorn Fehrm, aeronautical analyst with Leeham Co. \"When they build the fuselage and put in the interior, the insulation, the walls and so on, they are obliged to check that the supply from Spirit is correct. The quality assurance has to be made by Boeing.\" Concerns have also been voiced about the number of malfunctions that have occurred on aircraft in service. Publicly available information shows that by September last year, US carriers alone had reported more than 1,300 faults on 737 Max planes.  Although some of these were relatively minor, there were also potentially serious problems with flight management computers, autopilots, engines and other critical systems. The Foundation for Aviation Safety, a group led by former Boeing manager and whistleblower Ed Pierson, has been analysing the data. It says it finds the reports \"troubling, and the industry's complacency towards them even more disturbing\". It claims that because the planes have been operating for a relatively short amount of time, \"the overwhelming majority of these reports point directly to production quality defects\". \"I do think there is a fundamental cultural problem at Boeing,\" says Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general of the US Department of Transportation. \"They just don't realise how vulnerable they are to these kinds of quality control problems, and that jeopardises safety around the world where these planes operate.\" Over the past five years, Boeing has repeatedly stressed its commitment to putting safety at the heart of its operations.  When asked about the quality control issues, and its safety culture, a company spokesman referred the BBC to Mr Calhoun's comments this week, in which he pledged to co-operate with investigators and regulators \"to ensure all the procedures are put into place, inspections, all the readiness actions that are required to ensure every next airplane that moves into the sky is in fact safe and that this event can never happen again\". In the wake of the two previous accidents involving the 737 Max, off Indonesia in late 2018 and in Ethiopia in 2019, Boeing admitted misleading regulators and concealing information about the aircraft's safety. It avoided prosecution by agreeing to pay fines and compensation worth $2.5bn (\u00a31.8bn). Relatives of those who died aboard the Ethiopian plane say the latest incident suggests little has changed at the company in the past five years. Nad\u00e8ge Dubios-Seex lost her husband Jonathan in the crash, leaving her to bring up three children alone.  \"They absolutely haven't learned anything,\" she says. \"Nothing has been done. We're still in the corporate culture that's putting defective products out there.\" Zipporah Kuria, whose father Joseph Waithaka was killed in the same accident, agrees. \"I don't think Boeing has changed. I think this incident is a marker and an indicator of lack of change,\" she says. \"They say history repeats itself when we fail to learn from it - and here we are yet again.\" Against this background, Boeing has been working hard to get two new versions of the 737 Max, the relatively small Max 7 and the much larger Max 10, into service. In order to do so, it has requested a temporary exemption from safety rules recently introduced to prevent anti-icing systems from causing potentially catastrophic damage to engine inlets. Such an exemption would leave the new planes in exactly the same situation as existing 737 Max models, which are already obliged to use their anti-icing systems in a restricted manner to avoid problems occurring, but are otherwise able to operate normally. However, if the Alaska Airlines affair prompts regulators to take a harsher line with the company, experts say Boeing may find it harder to get the exemption it wants, potentially delaying the introduction of the new models.  That is just one extra headache facing the chief executive, as he attempts to deal with the aftermath of last week's incident.  So has Mr Calhoun lived up to his promises to make Boeing \"better\"? \"I think he's tried,\" says analyst Bjorn Fehrm. \"There is change at Boeing. But over the past five years we are only seeing the result of two and a half decades of mismanagement. To come back and rebuild a culture\u2026 is a long process.\"",

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been inspecting the jets after part of an Alaska Airlines plane's fuselage fell off on Friday. The FAA said its first priority was \"keeping the flying public safe\". Boeing's CEO Dave Calhoun told staff that its response \"is and must be\" the focus of the company. Thousands of passengers saw their flights cancelled after major US airlines grounded dozens of the jets. \"We have grounded the affected airplanes, and they will remain grounded until the FAA is satisfied that they are safe,\" the FAA said in a statement on Sunday. Boeing also said that it will hold an all-employee meeting about safety on Tuesday to address its response to the incident. \"When serious accidents like this occur, it is critical for us to work transparently with our customers and regulators to understand and address the causes of the event, and to ensure they don't happen again,\" Mr Calhoun said. Disruptions have primarily affected flights in the US. The vast majority of Boeing 737 Max 9s used in the US are operated by United Airlines and Alaska, while Turkish Airlines, Panama's Copa Airlines and Aeromexico have also grounded jets of the same model for inspections. Alaska grounded 65 planes, and said on Sunday that it had cancelled 163 flights, or 21%. Around 25,000 people were affected. The airline said travel disruptions from the grounding of some of its planes is expected to last until at least mid-week.United has grounded 79 planes, and said on Sunday it had cancelled about 180 flights.  Meanwhile, authorities are still searching for the plug door - which they believe fell to the ground in the western suburbs of Portland - and have appealed to the public to help find the panel. During Friday's incident, Alaska Airlines flight 1282 from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, reached 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began an emergency descent, according to flight tracking data. Passengers on board said a large section of the plane's outer shell fell to the ground shortly after take-off.  Images sent to news outlets show the night sky and lights of Portland visible through the gap in the fuselage, with insulation material and other debris also seen. One passenger said the gap was \"as wide as a refrigerator\" while another said a child's shirt was ripped off in the wind as the plane made its emergency landing. The plane, carrying 177 passengers and crew, landed safely back in Portland. Alaska said several passengers were injured, but not seriously. Boeing's 737 Max has been described as \"the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history\" after a series of safety issues. The Max was grounded in March 2019 for a year and a half after two of the type crashed in similar circumstances to each other, killing those on board. More recently, Boeing said it would increase the pace of 737 Max deliveries after resolving a supply error that required it to conduct lengthy inspections of new planes and its inventory. About 1,300 737 Max aircraft have been delivered to customers, Boeing data shows. Last month, the FAA urged airlines to inspect Max models for a possible loose bolt in rudder control systems.",

            "text": "Shares in Boeing have slumped after one of its planes was involved in a dramatic mid-air blowout in the US.  A cabin panel tore off a 737 Max 9 flown by Alaska Airlines, forcing an emergency landing and prompting safety officials to ground the same-make jets installed with the affected door plug. The US plane-maker's shares ended Monday trading down 8%, while shares in supplier Spirit Aerosystems fell 11%. The incident added to quality questions facing the firms.  \"It's more about the whole perception of Boeing as an operator and its long-term safety record,\" John Grant, chief analyst at the aviation analytics firm OAG, told the BBC's World Business Report programme. \"You have lots of individual incidents that are adding up to a very long catalogue of problems for Boeing and indeed for their airline customers\u00a0who need to use these aircraft.\" Boeing has been trying to emerge from the shadow of two high-profile crashes involving a different 737 model, the Max 8, in 2018 and 2019, which killed 346 people. Boeing started developing the 737 Max in 2011 as a more fuel-efficient option for short and medium-length flights.  It has been popular with airlines but dogged by questions about quality arising from electrical faults, loose bolts and other issues, some of which have also involved Spirit AeroSystems. Before the emergency near the Portland, Oregon airport, the firms' history had already drawn the attention of safety campaigners. After the incident, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded 171 of the fleet of more than 200 737 Max 9 planes for inspection, leading hundreds of flights on Alaska, United and other airlines to be cancelled. United on Monday said preliminary inspections had uncovered instances of installation issues related to the door plug - \"for example bolts that needed tightening\". The news sent shares lower in afternoon trading. Analyst Mr Grant said the industry generally had been having supply chain issues and struggling to deliver planes on time, leading to pressure to move more quickly.  \"You just sense that perhaps something has slipped in Boeing and it's been like that for a couple of years and they haven't got to grips with it,\" he said.  \"Boeing are really going to come back under the microscope again.\" Boeing said earlier Monday that the assembly under review was not found on other Max jets and that it was committed to safety and working with regulators. Spirit AeroSystems, which made and installed the part, had named a new chief executive in October. It said in a statement on Monday that its \"primary focus\" was \"the quality and product integrity of the aircraft structures we deliver\".  \"We are grateful the Alaska Airlines crew performed the appropriate procedures to land the airplane with all passengers and crew safe,\" Spirit said in its statement. \"Spirit is a committed partner with Boeing on the 737 program, and we continue to work together with them on this matter.\"  The plane involved in Friday's emergency had been cleared to fly and put into service a few months ago. Alaska Airlines staff had flagged it for pressurisation issues and the airline had restricted it from long flights over water. Since the 2018 and 2019 accidents, arch-rival Airbus has taken the crown of world's top plane-seller, expanding its market share against Boeing. Shares in the European firm rose more than 3% in trade on Monday.",

The cabin abruptly depressurised, creating a rush of air that ripped off the flight crews headsets and sent phones and other items flying out of the plane. The aircraft was delivered to Alaska Airlines on 31 October 2023, and would only have completed around 100 flights a month. Normal wear and tear or maintenance failures are unlikely to have been factors affecting such a young aircraft.  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSF), which is investigating the accident, has already said it does not suspect a design flaw. In fact, this type of door has been used on older Boeing 737s since 2006, and has not suffered any serious issues. That means the focus is likely to be on whether the door itself could have been faulty, and whether it was bolted in place correctly.  Alaska Airlines says it has since inspected other planes of the same type - Boeing 737 Max 9s - and discovered \"some loose hardware\". Meanwhile, United Airlines says bolts in need of \"additional tightening\" have been found while inspecting the relevant parts of its own fleet of 737 Max 9s.  The door was produced by Boeing's supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which has previously faced criticism for serious quality control failures. But Boeing itself has been accused in the past of chaotic conditions in its factories and corners being cut on the production line.  Boeing insists that is not the case today, and emphasises that safety is its first priority. The discovery of the missing door will provide vital clues for investigators about what went wrong and why.  The 737 Max 9 has been ordered by many different airlines. The way they use those planes will not always be the same, and there are different options available for seating.  The number of emergency exits required depends on the number of seats. With a less crowded cabin, it can operate with four main doors, and another four smaller exits over the wings.  But if configured with the maximum number of seats, a further two exits are required - midway between the wings and the tail of the aircraft.  In practice, Boeing builds all its Max 9 airframes with these extra doors. If they are not required, a non-operational door, or \"plug\" is fitted, concealed behind the interior trim.  The light that came on in the cockpit is known as an \"auto pressurisation fail\" light. It comes on when the pressure in the cabin, which is usually regulated automatically, changes at an unusually fast rate. The crew can respond by adjusting the cabin pressure manually, or if concerned by descending to a lower altitude. However, such warnings can also appear due to minor faults. In the case of the Alaska Airlines plane, the light had come on during several flights over a short period.  The issue had clearly been reported to maintenance staff, whose response would have been dictated by the aircraft's maintenance manual.  This is a document written by Boeing, but signed off by regulators. Restrictions were placed on where the plane could fly, and according to the NTSB additional investigations had been ordered, but had yet to be carried out when the failure occurred. In the immediate aftermath of Friday's accident (this is the term used by the NTSB), Alaska Airlines grounded its entire fleet of 65 737 Max 9 aircraft.  However, on Saturday 18 planes were briefly allowed back into service. Those planes had recently undergone major overhauls, including inspections of door plugs. No problems had been found and the company believed they were safe.  But when the Federal Aviation Administration issued an airworthiness directive banning affected aircraft from flying until they had undergone specific checks, it had no option but to ground all 18 planes once again.  The NTSB is carrying out a full investigation. This will involve, for example, examining the plane itself, the lost door (which has now been found in a back garden in Oregon), the contents of the flight data recorder and maintenance records, as well as interviewing flight crew, maintenance staff and employees of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems. The purpose of the investigation is to find out what went wrong and why. It is not meant to apportion blame.  However, there is clear jeopardy here for Boeing. The 737 Max is its bestselling aircraft, a favourite among airlines because of its low running costs and fuel efficiency.  But its safety record has already been badly tarnished as a result of two accidents that occurred in late 2018 and early 2019, in which 346 people were killed. The aerospace giant insists it is a different company today. In a message to staff, chief executive Dave Calhoun said \"when serious accidents like this occur, it is critical for us to work transparently with our customers and regulators to understand and address the causes of the event, and to ensure they don't happen again.\"",

            "text": "Thousands of passengers face flight cancellations after major US airlines grounded dozens of Boeing jets after a mid-flight blowout over Oregon. The US aviation regulator said 171 Boeing 737 Max 9s must be grounded for checks after part of an Alaska Airlines plane's fuselage fell off on Friday. Alaska said flight disruptions are expected to last into next week. United Airlines has grounded 79 planes. Disruptions are likely to primarily affect flights in the US. It follows regulator the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordering \"immediate inspections\" of 737 Max 9s worldwide. Required inspections would take around four to eight hours per aircraft, it said. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is following the FAA approach, but flight disruptions on the continent are expected to be minimal. EASA said it believes no European airlines operate Max 9s with the configuration covered by the FAA order. One of the world's largest intercontinental airports, London Heathrow, said there was no impact on flights. The bulk of the affected planes are owned by US airlines. United Airlines has grounded all 79 of its Max 9 planes.  Alaska said it cancelled 160 flights on Saturday, affecting about 23,000 passengers. Other airlines which also fly the planes have temporarily taken them out of service.  Boeing said it welcomed the FAA's decision, adding its teams were in close contact with the regulator. During Friday's incident, Alaska Airlines flight 1282 from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, reached 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began an emergency descent, according to flight tracking data. Passengers on board said a large section of the plane's outer shell fell to the ground shortly after take-off.  Images sent to news outlets show the night sky and lights of Portland visible through the gap in the fuselage, with insulation material and other debris also seen. One passenger said the gap was \"as wide as a refrigerator\" while another said a child's shirt was ripped off in the wind as the plane made its emergency landing. The plane, carrying 177 passengers and crew, landed safely back in Portland. Alaska said several passengers were injured, but not seriously.  \"My heart goes out to those who were on this flight - I am so sorry for what you experienced,\" Alaska's CEO Ben Minicucci said after the firm volunteered to ground 65 of its 737 Max 9 planes. \"I am so grateful for the response of our pilots and flight attendants,\" he added. Alaska later said that, as of Saturday afternoon, it had cancelled 160 flights. The airline said on Saturday that 18 of its Max 9 planes - about a quarter - had received \"in-depth inspections as part of heavy maintenance checks\" and were returned to service, but following the FAA's orders these have since been \"pulled from service\". \"We are in touch with the FAA to determine what, if any, further work is required before these aircraft are returned to service,\" Alaska said in a statement. It added: \"The aircraft involved in flight 1282 was delivered to us on 31 October. The part of the aircraft involved in this event is called a plug door - a specific panel of the fuselage near the rear of the aircraft.\"  The rear mid-cabin exit door is used in dense seating configurations on some Max 9 planes to meet evacuation requirements, but is \"plugged\" on other planes, including the Alaska flight.  United Airlines says it has carried out the inspections required by the FAA on some of its 737 Max 9 planes. Removing some of its aircraft from service was expected to cause about 60 cancellations on Saturday, the airline said in a statement. Turkish Airlines has grounded five of its 737 Max 9s. Flydubai said its three 737 Max 9s were not affected as they had a \"different configuration\" compared to the Alaska Airline planes and have completed recent safety checks. British regulator the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said there are no registered Boeing 737 Max 9 planes in the UK and therefore the impact would be \"minimal\". \"We have written to all non-UK and foreign permit carriers to ask for confirmation that inspections have been undertaken prior to any operation into UK airspace,\" a CAA spokesman said. In the US, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has taken charge of the Alaska investigation and its chair confirmed no passenger had been sat next to the affected section. \"We are very, very fortunate here that this didn't end up in something more tragic,\" Jennifer Homendy said.  Meanwhile, authorities are still searching for the plug door, which they believe fell to the ground in the community of Cedar Hills, about 11 km (seven miles) west of central Portland. Boeing's 737 Max has been described as \"the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history\" after a series of safety issues. The Max was grounded in March 2019 for a year-and-a-half after two of the type crashed in similar circumstances to each other killing those on board. Aviation expert John Strickland said the Alaska Airlines incident was very different to those crashes, adding that since the 737 Max came back into service it had \"a very good safety record\". \"While we know little evidence of why this section of the fuselage has come out - this has nothing to do with the aircraft being grounded for 18 months,\" he told BBC News. \"But, it is natural Alaska Airlines is taking a cautious approach grounding its fleet\" More recently, Boeing said it would increase the pace of 737 Max deliveries after resolving a supply error that required it to conduct lengthy inspections of new planes and its inventory. About 1,300 737 Max aircraft have been delivered to customers, Boeing data shows. Last month, the FAA urged airlines to inspect Max models for a possible loose bolt in rudder control systems.",

            "text": "Two phones and a \"door plug\": these are some of the items found in Oregon days after Alaska Airlines flight 1282 lost part of its fuselage at 16,000 feet. The Boeing 737 Max 9 made a safe emergency landing on 5 January after an outer section of the plane blew off minutes into the flight from Portland. None of the 177 people on board were seriously injured in the incident. But the search continues for other lost belongings and parts, thought to include a cushion from the seat immediately next to the blown-out section of fuselage - which was thankfully unoccupied. One of the key missing items, the door plug, was found by a local school teacher named Bob, according to US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chair Jennifer Homendy. The discovery came after officials from the NTSB asked the public for help finding the door plug - a 27kg (60lb) piece of fuselage with a window, that can be used as an emergency exit in certain configurations. They believed the door could have landed around Barnes Road, near Oregon-217 and the Cedar Hills neighbourhood, based on radar data. During a news conference, Ms Homendy said Bob sent in a picture of the missing piece, which ended up in his backyard in Portland. \"I can just see the outside of the door plug from the pictures, the white portions,\" Ms Homendy said. \"We can't see anything else but we're going to go pick that up and make sure that we begin analysing it.\" \"Thank you Bob,\" she added. The NTSB has since recovered the door plug from the teacher to aid in its ongoing investigation into the incident.  Taking a walk near Barnes Road, another man claimed he found a \"perfectly intact\" iPhone believed to belong to a passenger. Sharing photos of his discovery on X, formerly Twitter, game designer Sean Bates said the NTSB told him it was the second phone to be found. Mr Bates' photos show the stretch of Barnes Road where he said he found the phone, along with a picture of it - no cracks to be seen, but with a broken-off piece of what used to be a white phone charger still attached to it. He joked that it was possible that the phone's airplane mode feature being turned on helped it survive the 16,000ft (4,876m) drop. \"It was still pretty clean, no scratches on it, sitting under a bush and it didn't have a screen lock on it,\" Mr Bates said in a TikTok video. \"I opened it up and it was on airplane mode with a travel confirmation... so I had to go call the NTSB.\" The device appeared to display an email receipt for a $70 (\u00a355) checked baggage charge for the flight. Several passengers have described their fear during the incident, which happened shortly after take-off en route to Ontario, California. Evan Smith, one of the 171 passengers on board, said: \"There was a really loud bang towards the left rear of the plane and a woosh noise - and all the air masks dropped. \"They said there was a kid in that row who had his shirt sucked off him and out of the plane and his mother was holding onto him to make sure he didn't go with it.\" Jessica Montoia, another passenger, described the flight as a \"trip from hell\", adding that a phone was taken out of a man's hand by the wind. It is unclear whether that phone is the same Mr Bates found on his walk. Around 171 Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft remain grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as safety checks continue. Meanwhile, investigators have said the specific Alaska plane involved in Friday's incident experienced pressurisation warnings in the days before.",

            "text": "Alaska Airlines placed restrictions on the Boeing plane involved in a dramatic mid-air blowout after pressurisation warnings in the days before Friday's incident, investigators say. The jet had been prevented from making long-haul flights over water, said Jennifer Homendy of the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The NTSB also says the missing section of plane has now been found - in the back garden of a Portland teacher. No-one was hurt in Friday's drama.  After losing part of its fuselage, the plane - a Boeing 737 Max 9 - made a safe emergency landing after returning to its departure city, Portland.  There were 177 passengers and crew on board the flight to Ontario, California. Some 171 planes of the same type remain grounded by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as safety checks continue.  Before Saturday's intervention by the FAA, Alaska Airlines briefly returned some of its Max 9s to service, saying it had made \"no concerning findings\". Speaking at a news conference, Ms Homendy said pilots reported pressurisation warning lights on three previous flights made by the specific Alaska Airlines Max 9 involved in the incident. The decision to restrict lengthy flights over water was so that the plane \"could return very quickly to an airport\" in the event the warnings happened again, the NTSB chief added. It is not clear if there is a link between the issues that led to those warnings, and the issue that caused the blowout on 5 January.  \"An additional maintenance look\" was requested but \"not completed\" before the incident, Ms Homendy said.  The plane was brand new having been delivered to Alaska Airlines in October - at which time it was judged by the FAA to be airworthy.  Ms Homendy also used the conference to set out new details of the \"very chaotic\" and \"terrifying\" situation on board Alaska Airlines flight 1282. The force of the blowout caused the door of the cockpit to open and a laminated checklist and the first officer's headset both flew out into the cabin, she said. She added that no information from the cockpit voice recorder was available, as the recording had been automatically wiped after a two-hour cut-off was reached. The NTSB wanted this window to be increased to 25 hours, she added. Ms Homendy later announced that the part of the fuselage that detached had been found, after a teacher named Bob located the missing section in his backyard. \"I'm excited to announce that we've found the door plug,\" she told reporters. \"Thank you, Bob.\"  The plug is a piece of fuselage weighing 27kg (60lb), with a window, that can be used as an emergency exit in certain configurations. Authorities had been searching for it in Portland, the departure city. Ms Homedy said it was the \"key missing component\" to work out why the blowout happened.  Two mobile phones believed to have fallen from the aircraft are also reported to have been found.  An Oregon man shared an image of an iPhone which he said he had discovered, working as normal, in a grass verge beside a road. The device appeared to display an email receipt for a $70 (\u00a355) checked baggage charge for the flight. Flight 1282 reached 16,000ft (4.8km) when it began its emergency descent on Friday evening, according to flight tracking data. Images shared online - and later by investigators - showed a wide hole in the side of the craft, with oxygen masks dangling from the ceiling. One passenger, Diego Murillo, said the gap left by the missing component was \"as wide as a refrigerator\". Passengers were quoted by The Oregonian newspaper as saying that a young boy seated near the affected area had his shirt ripped off by the force of the decompression. Alaska Airlines said in its most recent statement: \"While we await the airworthiness directive (AD) inspection criteria from the FAA and Boeing, our maintenance teams are prepared and ready to perform the required inspections of the mid exit door plugs on our 737-9 Max fleet. \"The 737-9 Max grounding has significantly impacted our operation. We have cancelled 170 Sunday flights and 60 cancellations for Monday, with more expected.\" Boeing said in a statement: \"Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers.\"  The company's 737 Max has been described as \"the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history\" after a series of safety issues. In late 2018 and early 2019, two of its aircraft were lost in near identical incidents, off the coast of Indonesia and outside the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. A total of 346 people were killed. Both crashes were caused by flawed flight control software, which ultimately forced the planes into catastrophic dives, despite the best efforts of the pilots. After Friday's incident in the US, the European Union's regulator followed the example of its US counterpart. But it expected disruption to be minimal as it believed no European airlines used Max 9s with the configuration covered by the FAA order. Icelandair said it was not affected. The real-time flight-tracking website Flightradar24 confirmed that a number of the airline's Max 9s were in the skies on Monday morning.  The bulk of the affected planes are operated by US operators - 79 of them by United Airlines and 65 by Alaska - which has meant disruption for thousands of passengers.",

            "text": "It could have been a great deal worse.  The incident that befell Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 on 5 January would have been terrifying for passengers, but ultimately no-one was seriously hurt and the aircraft landed safely. However, the picture could have been very different if the failure had occurred further into the flight. It happened minutes after take-off from Portland International Airport while the aircraft - a Boeing 737 Max 9 plane - was still climbing. An unused emergency exit door blew out, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the fuselage. The plane suffered a rapid loss of cabin pressure, as air rushed out and the atmosphere within the plane equalised with the thinner air outside. The impact of this was reduced by two key factors. First of all, the passengers would all have been wearing seatbelts at this stage in the flight, keeping them in their seats. Secondly, data from aircraft monitoring sites show that the plane reached a maximum height of around 16,300ft before descending quickly. The cruising height of a 737 Max is around 38,000ft. At this level, the difference between the pressure inside the aircraft and the atmosphere outside is much greater. Had the door blown out here, the sudden rush of air would have been much more violent, and potentially lethal, especially if passengers were not wearing seatbelts. \"Passengers in the seats immediately adjacent, or in other seats around it who weren't wearing a seatbelt could have been sucked out of the aircraft\", explained Tim Atkinson, an aviation consultant and former aircraft accident investigator. \"I guess the worst case could be you lose a row full of people and a couple of others standing nearby as well.\" The temperature in the aircraft would also have dropped dramatically. Air at such altitudes is typically very cold, around -57C  (-71F).  Passengers and crew would have been reliant on emergency oxygen. Without it they would have quickly lost consciousness. Jennifer Homendy, chair of the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), said it was \"very, fortunate here that this didn't end up in something more tragic\". In 2018, exactly such an incident occurred to an older model of Boeing 737 being operated by Southwest Airlines. Debris from an engine failure broke one of the cabin windows while the plane was travelling at 32,000ft. The aircraft suffered a sudden decompression, and one passenger was partially sucked out of the window. She died as a result of her injuries. The immediate concern in this case is whether what happened to Flight 1282 could happen to other aircraft. The door in question is meant to be securely bolted to the fuselage using four bolts. The aircraft was only two months old, meaning simple wear and tear is unlikely to have been a factor.  That is why Alaska Airlines initially chose to ground its fleet of 737 Max 9s.  The US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) followed suit, temporarily grounding 171 aircraft for inspections. \"It could be design, it could be a manufacturing defect, or a combination of the two. Or it could be something else, something unknown\", said Mr Atkinson. The NTSB has revealed that pilots had seen a pressurisation warning light come on during previous flights, and that the plane had been restricted from making long journeys over water as a result. It has warned, however, that this might not be connected to the incident itself. An expert on 737 aircraft suggested to the BBC that the repeated appearance of such a warning light would certainly have been taken seriously. In addressing it, airline technicians would have followed the aircraft's maintenance manual - a document drawn up by Boeing but signed off by the regulator. He added that there are also indicator lights on the flight deck to warn when individual doors are not properly closed, but because the door that went missing was not in use, that particular warning light would not have been operational. The investigation is expected to involve both Boeing and its supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, which actually manufactured the door. For Boeing, there is an additional problem. The aircraft involved in the incident was a variant of the 737 Max, the latest generation of Boeing's 737 workhorse. The plane, designed to be much more fuel efficient than previous models, has been a hit with airlines. But its safety record has been badly tarnished. In late 2018 and early 2019, two aircraft were lost in near identical accidents, off the coast of Indonesia and outside the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. A total of 346 people were killed. Both crashes were caused by flawed flight control software, which ultimately forced the planes into catastrophic dives, despite the best efforts of the pilots. Those incidents led to the grounding of the global 737 Max fleet for more than 18 months while the problem was rectified and further safety checks were carried out. The head of the FAA subsequently described the design as \"the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history\". However, since the 737 Max came back into service, there have been a number of high profile problems with the programme, including electrical faults and quality control issues, some of which have also involved Spirit AeroSystems. Safety campaigners have also expressed concern about the number of reported malfunctions aboard aircraft that have gone into service. In December, Boeing called on airlines to inspect rudders on their aeroplanes, after a bolt was found to be missing on one aircraft. It said it was acting \"out of an abundance of caution\". In the wake of the accidents, Boeing faced widespread accusations of putting profit above the safety of passengers. Whistleblowers claimed the company was putting undue pressure on its employees to build too many aircraft too quickly, leading to chaotic conditions in its factories, and corners being cut on production lines. Boeing insists it is a different company today. Its chief executive, David Calhoun, has repeatedly emphasised its commitment to the highest standards of safety, quality and integrity. However, some critics remain unconvinced. Ed Pierson is a former senior Boeing manager who warned about problems on the 737 Max production line before the two crashes. He now heads an organisation called the Foundation for Aviation Safety, which has been scrutinising the aircraft's record. He insisted that conditions inside Boeing's factories have not improved, and that the US regulator has been ineffective in holding the company to account. \"This is just a gigantic wake-up call\", he said. \"This might just be a major blessing to have such a highly visible incident occur that will cause them to have to admit they have some serious problems.\" Boeing has consistently denied such problems exist.  In a statement issued after the FAA ordered the most recent groundings, the company said: \"Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers. We agree with and fully support the FAA's decision to require immediate inspections of 737-9 airplanes with the same configuration as the affected airplane.\" Boeing is in the process of ramping up production of the 737 Max to cut waiting times for customers and reduce its backlog of orders. Arguably, the timing of this latest incident involving its flagship aircraft could not have been worse.  Whatever the cause, it is likely to create further anxiety around the already-damaged 737 Max brand, particularly among passengers.",

            "title": "FAA grounds 171 Boeing planes after mid-air blowout on Alaska Airlines jet",
            "text": "The US airline regulator has ordered the grounding of some Boeing 737 Max 9 jets after part of one plane fell off during an Alaska Airlines flight. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the inspections would affect 171 planes. On Friday the Alaska Airlines flight had to make an emergency landing after take-off from the US state of Oregon. United Airlines says it has carried out the inspections required by the FAA on some of its 79 Boeing 737 Max 9 planes. Removing some of the aircraft from service was expected to cause about 60 cancellations on Saturday, the airline said in a statement. Earlier, the FAA said it would \"order the temporary grounding of certain Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft operated by US airlines or in US territory\".  Required inspections would take around four to eight hours per aircraft, it said. Turkish Airlines has also recalled its five planes of that model for checks.  In Friday's incident, the Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to Ontario, California, had reached 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began its emergency descent, according to flight tracking data. The airline, carrying 177 passengers and crew, landed safely back in Portland. The chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is investigating the incident, confirmed on Saturday that nobody had been sitting next to the affected section. \"We are very, very fortunate here that this didn't end up in something more tragic,\" Jennifer Homendy said.  She added that investigators believed the door that came off the plane was now in the Cedar Hills neighbourhood in Portland and urged anyone who found it to contact local police.  Meanwhile, the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) confirmed that there were no UK-registered 737 Max 9 aircraft.  \"We have written to non-UK and foreign permit carriers to ask inspections have been undertaken prior to operation in UK airspace,\" it wrote on X, formerly Twitter.  Images sent to news outlets of the affected area showed the night sky visible through the gap in the fuselage, with insulation material and other debris also seen. There were no immediate indications of the cause of the apparent structural failure, nor any reports of injuries. Passenger Evan Smith said: \"There was a really loud bang towards the left rear of the plane and a woosh noise - and all the air masks dropped. \"They said there was a kid in that row who had his shirt sucked off him and out of the plane and his mother was holding onto him to make sure he didn't go with it.\" In an audio clip, the pilot can be heard talking to air traffic control requesting a diversion. \"We are an emergency,\" she said. \"We are depressurised, we do need to return back.\" According to photographs, the affected area was in the back third of the plane, behind the wing and engines. The section of fuselage involved appears to be an area that can be used as an additional emergency exit door by some operators, but not by Alaska. Terry Tozer, a former airline pilot who has written extensively on aviation safety, said the section should have been bolted into place if it was not being used as an emergency exit.  He told the BBC News Channel that the passengers would not have been able to tell the area was not a normal window from inside the cabin.  While the loss of this section would probably not have affected how the aircraft flew, Mr Tozer added, there would have been a \"huge risk\" to anyone sitting nearby. Announcing the initial grounding of 65 planes, Alaska Airlines' CEO Ben Minicucci said: \"Each aircraft will be returned to service only after completion of full maintenance and safety inspections.\" A later statement said that more than a quarter of those planes had been inspected and would return to service as there were no issues found. In a statement, Boeing said it supported the FAA's decision. and was co-operating with the National Transportation Safety Board's investigation of the Alaska Airlines incident. \"Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers,\" Boeing said. It is the latest problem involving Boeing's best-selling model, which was grounded for almost two years following crashes in 2018 and 2019. ",

            "text": "Alaska Airlines says it has returned some of its grounded Boeing 737 Max 9 jets to service after one of its planes lost a section of fuselage mid-flight. The airline apologised to those affected, saying an inspection found \"no concerning findings\".  On Friday one of its planes had to make an emergency landing in the US state of Oregon after an outer section of the plane fell off. The plane, carrying 177 passengers and crew, landed safely in Portland. Boeing said it was aware of the incident and was \"working to gather more information\". The UK Civil Aviation Authority told the BBC it was \"monitoring the situation very closely\". Evan Smith, one of the 171 passengers on board, said: \"There was a really loud bang towards the left rear of the plane and a woosh noise - and all the air masks dropped.  \"They said there was a kid in that row who had his shirt sucked off him and out of the plane and his mother was holding onto him to make sure he didn't go with it.\" Diego Murillo said the gap was \"as wide as a refrigerator\". Fellow passenger Elizabeth Lee added: \"Part of the plane was missing and the wind was just extremely loud. but everyone was in their seats and had their belt on.\" Jessica Montoia described the flight as a \"trip from hell\" adding a phone was taken out of a man's hand by the wind. Announcing the initial grounding of 65 planes, Alaska Airlines' CEO Ben Minicucci said: \"Each aircraft will be returned to service only after completion of full maintenance and safety inspections.\"  A later statement said that more than a quarter of those plans had been inspected and would return to service as there were no issues found.

Images sent to news outlets show the night sky visible through the gap in the fuselage, with insulation material and other debris also seen.  Other pictures show the seat closest to the affected section, a window seat that passengers said was unoccupied, leaning forward without its cushion. \"My heart goes out to those who were on this flight - I am so sorry for what you experienced,\" Mr Minicucci said. \"I am so grateful for the response of our pilots and flight attendants.\"  In an audio clip, the pilot can be heard talking to air traffic control requesting a diversion.  \"We are an emergency,\" she said. \"We are depressurised, we do need to return back.\"  According to photographs, the affected area was in the back third of the plane, behind the wing and engines. The section of fuselage involved appears to be an area that can be used as an additional emergency exit door by some operators, but not by Alaska. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 \"returned safely... after the crew reported a pressurisation issue\". Boeing said a \"technical team stands ready to support the investigation\". Flydubai told the BBC that its three Boeing 737 Max 9 had a \"different configuration with mid-aft cabin exits\" compared to the Alaska Airline planes and have completed recent safety checks.  \"We will follow any guidance issued by Boeing once more information is available,\" a spokeswoman added. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident.  The Boeing 737 Max has been described as \"the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history\" after a series of safety issues. The Max was grounded in March 2019 for a year-and-a-half after two of the type crashed in similar circumstances to each other killing those on board. Aviation expert John Strickland said the Alaska Airlines incident was very different to those crashes, adding that since the 737 Max came back into service it had a \"very good safety record\". \"While we know little evidence of why this section of the fuselage has come out - this has nothing to do with the aircraft being grounded for 18 months,\" he told BBC News. \"But, it is natural Alaska Airlines is taking a cautious approach grounding its fleet\" More recently, Boeing said it would increase the pace of 737 Max deliveries after resolving a supply error that required it to conduct lengthy inspections of new planes and its inventory, Reuters news agency reported. About 1,300 737 Max aircraft have been delivered to customers, Boeing data shows. Last month, the FAA urged airlines to inspect Max models for a possible loose bolt in rudder control systems.

            "title": "Japan jet crash: How crew pulled off flawless evacuation from plane inferno",
            "text": "Passengers dashed to the emergency exits of a burning Japan Airlines jet without their hand luggage, in compliance with the flight crew's instructions. The simple act of leaving their valuables behind would be a \"major factor\" behind the speed of the evacuation, with the last person escaping just before the aircraft was engulfed in flames on the runway of Tokyo's Haneda Airport on Tuesday, aviation experts say. Japan Airlines Flight 516 turned into a fireball after it collided with a coastguard plane as it landed. Five of the six people on board the smaller aircraft - which had been due to deliver aid to victims of the powerful New Year's Day earthquake - died. But everyone on Flight 516 survived, with the flawless evacuation from the cabin as it filled with smoke astounding the world and winning praise from many. Aviation experts and industry professionals told the BBC it boiled down to staff on board putting their rigorous training into practice and \"well-behaved\" passengers who obeyed safety protocols. \"I don't see a single passenger on the ground, in any of the videos I've seen, that has got their luggage with them\u2026 If people tried to take their cabin luggage, that's really dangerous because they would slow down the evacuation,\" said Prof Ed Galea, director of the fire safety engineering group at the University of Greenwich in London. To see what happens when passengers try to take their luggage with them, one only has to look back to a crash landing in Dubai in 2016. Footage from inside the Emirates Boeing 777 involved shows people panicking as they clamber to grab their possessions, before they fled down emergency slides. The crew were praised for their efforts to evacuate passengers, and luckily all 300 on board the Dubai flight survived - but the video from inside that aircraft contrasts starkly with the well-drilled scenes witnessed in Tokyo on Tuesday. A former Japan Airlines flight attendant told the BBC that passengers on Tuesday's flight - which had departed from Sapporo's New Chitose airport at 16:00 local time (07:00 GMT) and landed at Haneda shortly before 18:00 - were \"incredibly fortunate\".  In the end, just one passenger on board flight 516 sustained bruises and 13 others requested medical consultations due to physical discomfort, the airline said.  \"I felt relieved to find out that all the passengers were safe,\" the former flight attendant said. \"But when I started thinking about the emergency evacuation procedure, I suddenly felt nervous and fearful. \"Depending on how the two planes collided and how the fire spread, it could have been a lot worse.\" According to the former attendant, all new crew members undergo stringent evacuation and rescue training for up to three weeks before they are allowed to serve in commercial flights. The training - which extends to how you control the tone and volume of your voice so you can be best heard by passengers - is repeated every year. \"We go through a written exam, case study discussions and practical training using different scenarios, such as when the plane has to make a water landing or if there is fire on board. Maintenance staff are also involved in such training,\" said the former flight attendant, who left the airline 10 years ago. On top of this, all aircraft manufacturers must show that everyone aboard can leave the plane within 90 seconds for their planes to be internationally recognised. But even so, in real-life situations, it can be difficult to ensure that passengers do not panic, said the former flight attendant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"What they achieved is harder than one can imagine. The fact that they managed to get everyone to escape is a result of good co-ordination among crew and passengers following instructions,\" she said. A pilot for a South East Asian airline, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, agreed that the flight crew's rigorous training was key to the passengers' escape. \"I must say it was amazing,\" he told the BBC. \"You really don't have time to think in a situation like this, so you just do what you were trained to do.\" It is all the more impressive when you take into account the position and condition of the aircraft, which - according to Prof Galea - would have made the evacuation all the more tricky. \"This accident was far from ideal. The aircraft was nose down, which meant it was difficult for passengers to move,\" he said. Only three inflatable slides could be used to evacuate passengers, but they were not properly deployed because of how the jet landed. The rear slide was very steep, which could have been dangerous. The aircraft's announcement system also malfunctioned during the evacuation, so the flight crew had to convey instructions using a megaphone and by shouting, Japan Airlines said.  But there were also signs the aircraft's design was working to give those on board the best chance of escape. Prof Graham Braithwaite, director of transport systems at Cranfield University in the UK, told the BBC it looked like it \"has done what it is designed to do, which is protect the occupants and allow a fast evacuation\". The role of the airport's fire crews on the ground - who, according to Prof Braithwaite, aim to get to any fire within two minutes - would also have been key in ensuring there was time to escape. \"The fire service focus will absolutely have been on protecting the exits and making sure there was a clear path for people to evacuate,\" he said. The larger fire, he explained, would only have been dealt with after the last person escaped. Lessons have also been learned from the past, with aviation safety regulations significantly strengthened after previous accidents, the pilot told the BBC. For instance, the collision of two Boeing 747 jets at Los Rodeos Airport in Tenerife in 1977 - which killed 583 people and remains the deadliest accident in aviation history - led to a review of cockpit procedures and radio communications. The crash was found to be due to miscommunication between flight crew and air traffic controllers.  An investigation is currently under way into what caused Tuesday's runway collision in Tokyo but, according to transcripts of conversations with the control tower which emerged on Wednesday, the coastguard plane had not been cleared for take-off while the passenger plane was given permission to land. Japan Airlines experienced its own catastrophe in August 1985, when Osaka-bound Flight 123 crashed into a mountain shortly after take-off from Tokyo Haneda. It was later attributed to faulty repair work by Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer. Only four out of 524 people on board survived the crash. The airline's record has been \"blemish free\" since then, Prof Braithwaite told the BBC, and it is a \"world leader\" when it comes to safety. Management at the company are so dedicated that in 2006, Japan Airlines opened a museum-like facility near Haneda displaying wreckage from the incident, aimed at promoting safety awareness among its employees.  \"In face of the pain and grief of the bereaved families and public distrust in airline safety [after the 1985 crash], we pledged that we would never again allow such a tragic accident to occur,\" Japan Airlines wrote on the facility's webpage.  \"Every member of staff is reminded that valuable lives and property are entrusted to us in our work.\" Additional reporting by Mariko Oi Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",

The airplane maker called for the inspections after an international operator discovered a bolt with a missing nut, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said. An airplane's rudder is used to control the aircraft while in flight. \"The issue identified on the particular airplane has been remedied,\" Boeing said.  \"Out of an abundance of caution, we are recommending operators inspect their 737 Max airplanes and inform us of any findings. We informed the FAA and our customers and will continue to keep them aware of the progress.\" The FAA said it was \"closely monitoring targeted inspections of Boeing 737 Max airplanes to look for a possible loose bolt in the rudder control system\". Boeing has recommended that the checks - which take only about two hours - happen within the next two weeks.  Any problems involving a faulty rudder would likely be identified in a pre-flight check, as crews routinely examine the rudder system before flying, Boeing said. Anthony Brickhouse, an air safety expert at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said that airlines \"need to take it seriously\". \"But as a member of the flying public, I don't see this as an issue to be concerned about,\" he told Reuters news agency. Boeing shares were down 1% in midday trade. Boeing's 737 Max was cleared to fly passengers again by US regulators in 2020 having been grounded for 20 months worldwide after two catastrophic accidents killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia.",

            "text": "Pilots of a Japanese airliner that collided with a smaller plane at Tokyo Haneda Airport were initially unaware that their jet was on fire. It was a flight attendant who informed them of the cabin fire, a Japan Airlines spokesperson told the BBC. After that, the evacuation of all 379 on board Japan Airlines Flight 516 proceeded with life-saving precision. Five of six people on board the smaller coastguard plane, a Bombardier Dash-8, died. \"Right after the plane touched down, the pilot felt a sudden shock, and lost control to stay in the runway. A fire took place but the pilots didn't recognise it in the beginning and learned about it [through the] cabin attendant,\" the JAL spokesperson said.  There were three pilots and 12 flight attendants on board when the incident took place. The aircraft's announcement system was damaged, leaving the crew to use megaphones and their own voices to shout instructions. \"The first thing cabin attendants did [after they realised there were] passengers who recognised that their plane was on fire, was to make them stay calm and not to stand up, which could make the escape very difficult.  The announcement system was unusable so these instructions were made without it.\"  Japanese media have described the evacuation as a \"miraculous 18 minutes\". Passengers left their hand luggage, dashed to emergency exits and slid out of the aircraft before it was engulfed in flames. \"[As] smoke started to come into the cabin and spread out... cabin attendants [began shouting] at passengers, [saying]: 'Leave your belongings!', 'Take off your high heels', and 'Head down',\" said the spokesperson.  Their \"co-operation... was [the] key for all passengers [being able] to escape quickly and safely\", they added.  Japanese authorities said late on Wednesday that the coastguard plane was not cleared for take-off on Haneda's runway. The plane was scheduled to deliver relief supplies to earthquake-hit areas. According to officials, the JAL flight was cleared to land on runway 34R at Haneda while the coastguard aircraft was told to \"taxi to holding point C5\" - a place on the airfield's taxiway system where aircraft await permission to enter the active runway for take-off. The transcript shows the coastguard aircraft acknowledged the call from air traffic to taxi to the holding point - its last transmission before the collision. The transcripts appear to contradict the coastguard plane's captain - the only one of the six crew to survive - who told investigators he had been given permission to enter the runway which the JAL airliner was approaching. The BBC has also found information that suggests the series of lights at the relevant holding point may not have been working. But experts point out there are other visual cues like painted markings which would show where aircraft needed to stop short of the runway. The well-drilled scenes on the Japan Airlines plane contrast starkly with aircraft evacuations that fail to strictly adhere to safety protocols. In 2016, an Emirates Boeing 777 crash landed in Dubai and video footage showed chaotic scenes of passengers trying to take their luggage with them as they fled to the emergency slides. The crew were praised for their efforts to evacuate passengers, and luckily all 300 on board the Dubai flight survived. Tuesday's incident is the first major accident involving an Airbus A350, one of a new breed of aircraft built largely of advanced materials such as carbon fibre-reinforced plastic. The aircraft manufacturer is sending a team of specialists to assist in the investigation of the Japan Transport Safety Board.",

It was bound for Zyryanka, 1,100km (685 miles) to the north-east, and was due to fly on to another small town in Srednekolymsk before returning to Yakutsk. Video from one of the passengers showed the plane almost in the centre of the frozen River Kolyma in eastern Siberia. Temperatures in Zyryanka dip to around -40C at this time of year. Prosecutors said the plane had landed on a sandbank in the river. A trail in the snow revealed how long it had taken to come to a standstill. ",

British Airways said it took such matters extremely seriously but confirmed no disruption was caused. In the UK Airprox Board (UKAB) report, the drone was described as white, with multiple propellers but no lights. The pilot said that whilst it was very close, it was apparent the drone would pass below and to their left. Air traffic controllers were informed, who then passed the information on to the Heathrow control tower so other aircrafts could be made aware. UKAB concluded \"the reported altitude and/or description of the object were sufficient to indicate that it could have been a drone\". It considered the risk of collision as A, the highest category. British Airways said the aircraft continued to its destination without issue. The company said its pilots reported incidents so that authorities could investigate and take appropriate action. The BBC has contacted the Civil Aviation Authority and Heathrow Airport for a response. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram. Send your story ideas to south.newsonline@bbc.co.uk.",

            "title": "Zero carbon flight 'as big a challenge as Concorde'",
            "text": "The woman who runs Airbus's base near Bristol has described the challenge of taking carbon emissions out of aviation as \"similar to building Concorde\". Sue Partridge runs the Wing of Tomorrow programme for the European aerospace giant.  Her team is designing wings to fly on hydrogen, with near zero emissions. She has been at the aircraft factory, based in Filton, in the north of the city, for 34 years, but says this is \"the biggest challenge\" she has seen. Concorde was designed and built in Filton, in collaboration with French engineers. Sue Partridge said she was \"very proud\" of her site's heritage. \"When I started all the older engineers had all worked on Concorde, and they used to talk about 'when I worked on Concorde'.\" Today, that generation has retired. It is 20 years since Concorde 216 made its last flight, landing on the Filton runway on 26 November 2003. The new generation of engineers have a new challenge, Ms Partridge explained. \"This challenge we have to decarbonise aviation, to make aviation stop impacting our planet, is a similar size challenge to Concorde.\" The supersonic aircraft was famously thirsty.  Concorde burned 20 tonnes of jet fuel an hour, nearly four times as much as a modern Airbus A350. And because she could only carry 100 passengers, the luxury jet consumed 17 litres to carry one passenger each 62 miles (100km). A modern Airbus will use just 2.9 litres by comparison. Even by the standards of her times, Concorde used a lot of fuel. It was generally acknowledged the cost of flying supersonic to New York was about three times the fuel consumption of a Boeing 747. Today's Airbus jets owe much of their fuel efficiency to the wing designers of Filton. \"Many people don't realise how important wing design is to saving fuel,\" Ms Partridge explained. \"Our latest aircraft, the A321 XLR, will be 30% more efficient than the aircraft it replaces.\" But even efficient aircraft still use kerosene, still produce carbon dioxide and still contribute to climate change. So now the engineers in the factory that broke the sound barrier are trying to create aircraft with \"near zero\" emissions. Most will run on hydrogen, either burned directly or used in fuel cells to generate electricity on board. The engineering challenges are huge. \"You're talking about storing cryogenic hydrogen on the aircraft at minus 250 centigrade,\" Ms Partridge told me. \"Managing that hydrogen, and burning it or using a fuel cell to fly without using any kerosene-based fuel whatsoever.\" Airbus expects to have these aircraft in the skies \"in the mid 2030s\".  Aviation's critics are sceptical.  Cait Hewitt, policy director of the Aviation Environment Federation, has analysed the government's own policy documents, called \"Jet Zero\". \"Hydrogen planes are unlikely to be on long haul routes,\" she said. \"They're unlikely to be at a big scale. The government's forecast is that the introduction of zero emission aircraft might cut emissions from the aviation sector by 4% by 2050.\" The problem is that every airport in the world will have to install new fuel tanks for compressed hydrogen, all at 250 degrees below zero. Hydrogen will have to be made on a huge scale, near to the airports that use it, with renewable electricity. And politicians, regulators and passengers will all need persuading that the new planes are safe, and genuinely low-emission. Compared to this, breaking the sound barrier is starting to look simple.

            "text": "A Boeing 747 cargo jet has been forced to turn around, after a horse escaped from its stall and caused chaos as the plane cruised at 30,000ft (9,144m). The plane was headed to Belgium from New York but did a U-turn roughly 90 minutes after its departure when the animal got loose.  Air traffic control audio recorded the pilot saying: \"We have a live animal, a horse, on board the airplane. The horse managed to escape.\"   \"We cannot get the horse back secured.\"  The pilot flying Air Atlanta Icelandic flight 4592 told air traffic control the plane was fine but that the horse on the loose was the concern. He then requested a veterinarian meet the aircraft once it landed back at John F Kennedy International Airport. As the plane made its way back during the incident last Thursday, the pilot said he needed to dump 20 tonnes of fuel, \"east of Nantucket\", a popular enclave for the rich near Massachusetts.  The plane had to dump the fuel due to the plane's weight.  It remains unclear how the horse Houdini-ed its way out, but it was unrestrained when the plane landed at the airport. \"Do you require assistance?\" air traffic control asked the pilot after the plane arrived.  \"On the ground, negative\" the pilot replied. \"On the ramp, yes. We have a horse in problem, in difficulty.\"  The flight took off later in the same day and successfully arrived at Liege Airport on Friday morning, according to FlightRadar24. Air Atlanta Icelandic did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. Why the horse was being transported also remains unknown. One of the more common reasons is the transportation of race horses, according to experts. \"You have a first class, a business class, and the economy,\" one source told CNN, referring to the different size container options available for the animals. This latest incident was not the first time an animal escaped its cargo stall while onboard an airplane. In August, a bear freed itself from its crate on an Iraqi Airways flight headed from Dubai to Baghdad, the Associated Press reported.",

            "text": "A deal to settle a dispute between the UK and the United States over support for aircraft makers will mean \"more jobs and opportunities in Wales\", the international trade secretary has said. On a visit to Flintshire, Liz Truss said the truce would bring more business to the Airbus Broughton site. Welsh producers had \"a lot to gain\" from global trade deals, she added. But farming unions are concerned a deal with Australia could make Welsh lamb less competitive. The agreement with the US to suspend retaliatory tariffs on a range of goods ends a 17-year trade row over subsidies for Airbus and Boeing. Airbus employs 5,000 people at the Broughton site. Visiting the factory on Friday, Ms Truss said ending the \"tit-for-tat trade war\" was in everybody's interests. \"It means more jobs and opportunities here in Wales - high-quality jobs and future growth for the industry, and we've just had the good news that 70 more aircraft have been ordered,\" she said. \"That will bring more business into this factory and of course that's because there's no longer those tariffs being charged on those wings.\" Ms Truss was also asked about the agreement in principle the UK government has reached with Australia on future trade. Following the exit from the EU, the UK government is seeking to sign free-trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries to remove or lower tariffs. Imports from Australia currently face tariffs, making products such as Australian beef and lamb more expensive to buy in shops and supermarkets in the UK. If accepted, the deal would lead to quotas on tax-free trade being phased out over 15 years. The National Farmers' Union has warned that freeing up the UK-Australian trade in meat would lead to hundreds of British cow and sheep breeders going out of business. \"I think there are huge opportunities for Welsh lamb and Welsh beef,\" Ms Truss said. \"I think we should be proud of the product we produce - Welsh lamb is one of the best, in my opinion, in the world, and we have nothing to fear from opening up to those opportunities. \"In fact I think we've got a lot to gain.\" Ms Truss said she would be working now on getting UK lamb into the US. \"The future of Welsh lamb is very positive - it's a product people want to buy, we're seeing growing demand across the world and I think we're going to hold our own.\"",

            "text": "Europe's aviation safety watchdog will not accept a US verdict on whether Boeing's troubled 737 Max is safe. Instead, the European Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) will run its own tests on the plane before approving a return to commercial flights. The 737 Max has been grounded since March after two fatal crashes.   But Easa told the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) there would be \"no delegation\" on safety approval in a letter sent on 1 April.  Patrick Ky, Easa's chief executive, revealed a list of four conditions given to the US authorities in a presentation to the European Parliament's committee on transport and tourism on Monday. Europe's tough stance is a blow to Boeing's hopes of a rapid return to service for the 737 Max, and is also a significant break with the established international practice of aviation regulators accepting each other's standards. A spokesperson for the FAA said it had \"a transparent and collaborative relationship with other civil aviation authorities as we continue our review of changes to software on the Boeing 737 Max\".  \"Our first priority is safety, and we have set no timeframe for when the work will be completed. Each government will make its own decision to return the aircraft to service, based on a thorough safety assessment.\" The 737 Max plane has not flown commercially since an Ethiopian Airlines aircraft crashed shortly after take-off on 10 March, killing 157.  It followed a Lion Air crash on 28 October last year which killed 189. In both incidents, investigators have focused on the role played by a software system called MCAS (Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System), which was designed to make the aircraft easier to fly.  Probes have shown the software - and the failure of sensors - contributed to pilots not being able to control the aircraft. Mr Ky's presentation showed a refusal to accept delegation was the first of the four conditions that had to be met before flights in Europe could resume.  The other three were:  Easa's work on the 737 Max had entailed \"an unprecedented level of effort\", with 20 aviation experts and two to three online meetings a week with Boeing engineers.  There were plans for a full week of trial flights with a modified aircraft at Boeing's flight test centre in Seattle. Boeing has been working on changes to the 737 Max's flight control systems to avoid the MCAS problem. As well as changes to the plane, it has proposed changes to the ways pilots are trained. Reports in the US have suggested that Boeing had hoped for FAA safety clearance next month, with airlines free to fly the aircraft later in the year.   FAA approval would allow US airlines to fly the aircraft, but European operators - including Norwegian Air - would need Easa clearance before returning it to commercial service.",

But a minister has rejected criticism of Prime Minister Theresa May's lobbying efforts. Richard Harrington, a minister at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, was speaking at a Westminster committee. He said: \"The appeals the prime minister made to the president would not seem to have made a difference.\" Mrs May spoke to US President Donald Trump about the issue before the US Commerce Department decided to impose near 300% import tariffs on Bombardier's C-Series aircraft in December. It followed a complaint from rival Boeing about UK and Canadian aid to Bombardier. The US International Trade Commission is due to make a final decision in the case by the end of this month. But Mr Harrington told MPs on the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee: \"My expectation is things will not be very different from what has already been determined.\" There have been fears the outcome could impact on jobs at Bombardier in Belfast, where 1,000 workers make wings for the C-Series. The government, which is backing Bombardier in the dispute, could appeal the final outcome to the World Trade Organisation, but cases can take years to resolve. Mr Harrington said he believed the entire Boeing case was \"spurious\", adding: \"It is a complete try-on for their own anti-competitive purposes.\" In evidence last year, Boeing told the committee that Bombardier had been found \"to have violated trade law\" in a sale to the US airline, Delta. It argued: \"The US process is not political but legal and it is very simple.\" By expecting Bombardier to lose, the trade union Unite said the government was \"raising the white flag on jobs without a fight\". Its assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, said Mr Harrington's comments were \"a disgrace\".",

Bombardier has faced a series of problems over the plane, most recently a trade dispute with rivals Boeing that resulted in the US imposing a 300% import tariff. What does the Bombardier-Airbus deal mean for Belfast - and where does it leave Bombardier's spat with Boeing?  In the here and now, it seems yes.  Airbus got 50.01% of something for nothing - and it did not even have to stump up towards huge development costs which nearly bankrupted Bombardier.  In teaming up with Airbus, the future of the C-Series seems much brighter for Bombardier.  Even before the US tariff case, orders for the C-Series were proving a tough challenge.  They have been more-or-less static around the 360 mark for over a year.  Airbus will bring financial clout and sales muscle in markets like China, where the C-Series is interesting a number of airlines.  Some industry analysts predict Airbus may ultimately take entire ownership of the C-Series in years to come - buying out stakes held by Bombardier (30%) and Quebec (20%). On the face of it, the deal changes nothing.  The case, probably due to be adjudicated on in February, still rests on whether Boeing suffered any harm when Bombardier did a cut-price deal with airline Delta to win a major C-Series order.  Boeing has reacted with hostility to the Airbus-Bombardier tie-up.  It is hard to see it dropping its complaint and it could be argued in an era of US protectionism the stakes have been raised significantly.  The idea that the C-Series could now be assembled in Alabama, where Airbus has a facility, thus avoiding US tariffs, is intriguing but it may not be that straightforward if it is viewed as a mechanism simply to avoid tariffs. In the short term, this is good news.  The more secure the C-Series, then the safer the jobs in Belfast.  There are some suggestions Airbus could even use wing production techniques in Northern Ireland for its own aircraft, as well as the C-Series.  But equally, Airbus has its own wing plant in Wales, so is that a risk to Belfast?  These are questions for much further down the line.  It is also worth remembering the deal only directly relates to the quarter of the 4,000 workforce engaged in C-Series wings.  The remaining employees work on other Bombardier aircraft programmes and some of that work has already been siphoned off to sister plants like that in Morocco, where production costs are cheaper.  So other anxieties are still there. Boeing and Airbus are the gorillas of the aerospace market, which includes two other relative minnows, Bombardier of Canada and Embraer of Brazil.  There is no love lost between Boeing and Airbus, whose aircraft ranges directly compete with each other.  Boeing is said to have long regrets about not being more aggressive against financial assistance to its European rival.  Indeed, Boeing's competition case against Bombardier is in some ways seen as trying to curtail the Canadian's firm's growth - something it feels it should have done with Airbus 40 years ago.  Off the back of the Airbus-Bombardier deal, there is speculation of a fuller partnership between Boeing and Embraer.  They already have collaboration agreements.",

            "title": "Air India: How the record plane deal is a game-changer",
            "text": "Air India's record deal for 470 planes from Airbus and Boeing has happened at a time when the carrier plans to become \"a world-class proposition\", in the words of N Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata group, which owns the airline. These orders - beating the American Airlines' 460-plane deal in 2011 - would modernise Air India's fleet and help it to \"dramatically\" expand its network, Mr Chandrasekaran said.  The troubled national carrier, which was acquired by Tatas about two years ago, has retired most of its older aircraft and launched a five-year plan to modernise its ageing fleet. The first new plane will go into service at the end of this year. The sheer size of this new order indicates Air India's desire to reclaim its pole position in India's crowded aviation market and acquire a strategic edge to service the world, say experts. \"These orders directly synergise Air India's fleet with Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines - all part of Star Alliance, the world's largest global airline alliance,\" said Mark Martin, an aviation analyst. \"To me it looks like a big game plan to counter the dominance of Gulf carriers, for whom Star Alliance has been an arch nemesis\".  Indian travellers currently rely heavily on Emirates, Qatar Airways, Etihad and other Middle Eastern airlines for overseas connections to Europe, US and other parts of the world. That could change as Air India's new fleet are put into service, Mr Martin believes.  The acquisition of wide bodied aircraft like the A350s will allow Air India to penetrate markets like the US and Australia directly through non-stop flights between these destinations and India. These are lucrative routes to service the massive Indian diaspora that resides overseas. But challenging the monopoly of the Gulf carriers will not be easy, given their \"loyal base\" and ability to launch pricing wars, says Ajay Awtaney, founder of LiveFromALounge.com, an India focused aviation website. For years, Air India has been plagued by consumer grievances over ill-maintained cabins, dysfunctional entertainment systems and broken charging points. While customers will get an \"upgraded experience\" when the new fleet is brought in, a shortage of human resources and trained personnel remains a issue, according to Mr Awtaney.  For many years after it was founded by the Tatas, and before it was nationalised by the government in the 1950s, Air India was considered the global standard bearer for service.  But following years of mismanagement under subsequent governments, a mounting debt burden and failed attempts to revive its former glory, Air India was sold back to the Tatas in a $2.4bn (\u00a31.98bn) deal in 2021 - marking a homecoming for the airline after 68 years.   \"These orders will silence the critics of Air India's disinvestment. Its potential under the government was unexplored,\" Jitendra Bhargava, former executive director at Air India told the BBC. But in order to truly realise its potential and effectively run fifth-generation aircraft like the A350s, the carrier will have to rapidly modernise its operations, including software systems, maintenance and human resource capabilities, say experts. \"If they are successful, they will take India's uniqueness to the globe once again, after many years,\" said Mr Martin.  However to make a dent globally, Air India will need to start focusing \"beyond just India originating passengers and generate more connecting traffic\", Mr Awtaney added. For this, it will need to both optimise its route network and India will need to improve infrastructure.  Snaking queues and long waits at immigration in Delhi and Mumbai over the winter have shown that India doesn't yet have adequate capacity to handle a large surge in passenger traffic. But the country is building at least 80 new airports over the next five years as part of its focus on state-led capital expenditure on infrastructure.  The Indian aviation market has seen a sharp recovery post pandemic, with domestic traffic growing by 48.9% year-on-year according to government figures. More than 122 million Indians took internal flights in December 2022, latest data shows. India also is expected to be a major driver of growth in global aviation with domestic carriers expected to place orders for 1,500-1,700 aircraft over the next two years according to Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation India (CAPA India) estimates.",

            "title": "Rwanda asylum flight cancelled after legal action",
            "text": "The first flight due to take asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda was cancelled minutes before take-off after legal rulings on Tuesday evening. Up to seven people had been expected to be removed to the east African country. But the flight was stopped after a late intervention from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) led to fresh challenges in the UK courts. Home Secretary Priti Patel said she was \"disappointed\" but added: \"Preparation for the next flight begins now.\" However, James Wilson from campaign group Detention Action said the rare intervention from the ECtHR \"shows how potentially dangerous\" the Rwanda removals are. He said the court had recognised no one should be forced on to a plane until the policy was fully scrutinised in a High Court hearing next month. The Rwanda asylum plan, announced by the government in April, sees some asylum seekers who cross the Channel to the UK given a one-way ticket to Rwanda to claim asylum there instead. The government said the scheme would discourage others from crossing the English Channel.  The cancellation of the flight followed days of arguments in UK courts, ending with the home secretary getting the go-ahead to begin transporting some of the asylum seekers. A Boeing 767, chartered at an estimated cost of \u00a3500,000, had been due to take off at 22:30 BST from a military airport in Wiltshire. But a judgement from the ECtHR in Strasbourg halting the deportation of one of the men arrived just after 19:30, and triggered a series of legal challenges in London courts. By 22:15 all the passengers had been removed from the plane, which then returned to Spain. The Strasbourg human rights court - part of the Council of Europe, which still counts the UK as a member, rather than the European Union - said an Iraqi man known as KN faced \"a real risk of irreversible harm\" if he remained on the flight. Whereas the High Court in London had found that KN could be returned to the UK if his bid to overturn the Rwanda transportation policy succeeded, the ECtHR said there was no legally enforceable mechanism to ensure he could come back from east Africa. It took little over an hour for the entire plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda on Tuesday night to come crashing down like a house of cards  - thanks to a series of linked decisions, all triggered by one ruling from the European Court of Human Rights. The seven remaining passengers with orders to board the Boeing 767 warming up at MoD Boscombe Down looked like they had run out of options - but the Strasbourg court, which has the final say in human rights issues, ruled that one claimant had raised genuine concerns about the scheme and the fact that British judges had not yet properly looked at conditions in Rwanda. That decision, in just one case, led the remaining men to appeal - some to judges in London. Ultimately, all the removal orders were scrapped. However, the policy is not dead. What we don't know right now is how judges will ultimately rule when they examine the entire Rwanda policy next month.  This battle - between ministers, lawyers they regard as enemies, and now the European Court - is only just beginning. The Strasbourg court also said the UN had raised concerns that UK asylum seekers transferred to Rwanda would not have access to \"fair and efficient\" procedures to determine their refugee status. And it noted that the High Court had acknowledged there were serious issues regarding whether Rwanda had been correctly assessed as a safe third country. The home secretary said these \"repeated legal barriers\" were similar to those the government faced on other deportations, adding that \"many of those removed from this flight will be placed on the next\". Ms Patel said that she had always maintained this policy would \"not be easy to deliver\" but added it was \"very surprising\" the European court had intervened after the government had been permitted to go ahead with the flights by domestic courts. \"Our legal team are reviewing every decision made on this flight and preparation for the next flight begins now,\" she said. The Rwandan government said it remained committed to its deal with the UK and was \"not deterred\" by the failure of the first flight to depart. Spokeswoman Yolande Makolo said: \"Rwanda stands ready to receive the migrants when they do arrive and offer them safety and opportunity in our country.\" Earlier on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his cabinet that people undermining the Rwanda policy were \"abetting the work of criminal gangs\" and said the government would not be deterred from the policy. Asked by reporters if the UK would withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights, which the Strasbourg court upholds, Mr Johnson said it \"very well may be\" necessary to change the law. But groups supporting asylum seekers urged the government to change course and provide a fair way for people fleeing persecution to seek refuge in the UK. Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon said the fact the flight could not take off was \"indicative of the inhumanity of the plan\" and said the government had to rethink its plans by having \"a grown-up conversation with France\" over Channel crossings by migrants. Mr Wilson from Detention Action said the European Court of Human Rights, founded in the wake of the Holocaust, had \"done what it was established to do\", calling it \"a night for the history books\".",

            "text": "At least 36 people have been injured, 11 seriously, after a Hawaiian Airlines flight from Phoenix to Honolulu was hit by severe turbulence. One passenger said the shaking became so severe they were \"pretty much floating off of our chairs\". Twenty people were taken to local hospitals with injuries ranging from lacerations, bruising and loss of consciousness to head injuries. Thunderstorms were reported in the area at the time of the turbulence. On Monday, the US National Transportation Safety Board announced it is investigating the incident. There were 278 passengers and 10 crew on board the Airbus A330-200. The incident on Flight HA35 happened on Sunday morning, shortly before the plane came in to land at Honolulu's Daniel K Inouye International Airport. A statement from Hawaiian Airlines read: \"Medical care was provided to several guests and crew members at the airport for minor injuries while some were swiftly transported to local hospitals for further care.\" Of the people taken to hospital, about 17 were passengers and three were crew members. A 14-month-old baby and a teenager were among them.  Hawaiian Airlines' chief operating officer Jon Snook said he was \"grateful\" for the support provided by emergency services and that \"it looks like everybody's going to survive\".  He added there had been unstable weather conditions in Hawaii recently that created challenges for airlines. One passenger told Hawaiian broadcaster KHON2 that the severe turbulence only lasted a few seconds, but it was enough to injure the passengers. \"It was just rocky. And then, it quickly just escalated to, like, the point where we're shaking so much that we were, like, pretty much floating off of our chairs,\" Jacie Hayata Ano said. \"You could see people were hurt around us and things are just everywhere... that's pretty surreal,\" she added. The airline said it was conducting a \"thorough investigation\" of the plane before it returns to service. Turbulence is a fact of flying - however severe incidents like those on flight HA35 experienced are rare, and a bit of a bumpy flight is usually nothing to worry about. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), turbulence can be caused by: Sometimes it can be predicted - and pilots are known to radio to each other to give advanced warnings - but it can also come out of nowhere. Even though it is a weather phenomenon, turbulence can happen anywhere and in any conditions. The most important thing to do is to keep your seatbelt on - on average 58 people in the US are injured during turbulent flights when not wearing seatbelts every year, according to the FAA.",

            "text": "Three years after the downing of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 in Tehran, families and friends of those who died are still pushing for accountability. But they have been greeted with multiple hurdles along the way, including threats to their safety. Reza Akbari is one of many Iranian-Canadians who lost a loved one on 8 January 2020, when Flight 752, destined for Kyiv, Ukraine, was shot down by two anti-aircraft missiles after it took off in Tehran.  All 176 were killed.  As the former president of the Iranian Heritage Society in the city of Edmonton, where 13 of the victims lived, Mr Akbari has pushed for Iran to be held accountable for the deaths.  But ahead of one planned demonstration in October, Mr Akbari felt fearful for his safety. He had been receiving frightening and suspicious phone calls from strangers. In one instance, he believed he was being followed by two men when he was out walking in a deserted part of town.  While the men only asked him for directions, he took it as a sign that he was being watched by people close to the Iranian government. \"Was it a coincidence? I don't think so,\" he added. \"I thought that was a sign that they could come whenever. That they have eyes on me and have people all over.\" Mr Akbari has reported this incident and others to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and he is not the only one.  Several Iranian dissidents have spoken out in recent months about being harassed and intimidated on Canadian soil, saying they have been monitored and followed at protests or have had their social media or email addresses hacked.  Others, like Kaveh Shahrooz, a Toronto-based human right lawyer who sits on a legal advisory committee for families of Flight 752 victims, say their loved ones in Iran have been visited by agents in the country as a result of them speaking out abroad.  Canada's spy agency - the Canadian Security Intelligence Service - confirmed to the BBC in a statement that they are aware that Canadians, especially those in diaspora communities, are being monitored and intimidated by \"hostile state actors, including the Islamic Republic of Iran\".  \"The tactics and tools used for such purposes include cyber espionage and threats designed to silence those who speak out publicly against them,\" CSIS spokesperson Eric Balsam said, adding that the agency is investigating these incidents. Iran has been accused of harassing dissidents in other countries abroad, including the US and the UK. Last November, Met Police guarded the offices of Iran International, an independent Farsi-language news channel in the the UK, after British intelligence intercepted discussions of planning actual attacks against dissident journalists. The regime has also harassed BBC Persia journalists in the UK, prompting BBC lawyers to file a complaint to the UN. In 2021, the FBI said it was looking for a man alleged to have hired private investigators to spy on people speaking out against the Iranian regime in all three countries.  Iran has no formal relations with Canada, and has not commented publicly on the CSIS probe. The BBC has reached out to Iran's foreign ministry for comment.  Hamed Esmaeilion, who lost his wife, Parisa Eghbalian, and their nine-year-old daughter Reera on Flight 752, said he has been the subject of harassment and attacks on social media since he began advocating for his family and other victims three years ago.  He said he believes the intimidation tactics from the Iranian government are part of \"a propaganda machine against anyone who is standing in front of them.\" Despite these threats, Mr Esmaeilion and others have continued to push for a coordinated international effort to have Iran answer for what happened.  They have also lent their support to Iranians who have taken to the streets by the thousands, calling for freedom and justice, following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini last September after she was detained by Iran's morality police.  \"People are recognising more and more that all these crimes are connected,\" Mr Shahrooz said. \"It didn't start with Mahsa Amini, or even the plane. These crimes go back 43 years with the birth of the Islamic Republic.\" Of those who perished on the flight, 138 had ties to Canada, including 55 citizens and 30 permanent residents. The dead included 29 children, 53 university students, four newlywed couples, and eight entire families. Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation has blamed the downing of the plane, which occurred amid heightened tensions in the region following the US killing of top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad, on \"human error\". But in a 2021 report, Canada said Iran's government was \"fully responsible\" for the incident, though there was no evidence to suggest it was premeditated.  In the three years since the tragedy, the victims' families have explored multiple avenues to get answers from Iran, including taking the unusual step last year of filing a case in the International Criminal Court, which does not typically hear from civilians.  In its filing, the families argued that the downing of the plane was a war crime and part of systematic attacks on civilians amounting to a crime against humanity, Mr Shahrooz said. Their case, however, has yet to be heard.  A separate effort to have the International Civil Aviation Organisation probe the incident reached a significant milestone in late December, after the governments of the UK, Canada, Ukraine and Sweden announced they had jointly requested that Iran submit to binding arbitration, arguing the missiles that downed the flight were launched \"unlawfully and intentionally\".  The Iranian government now has six months to respond, a spokesperson for Canada's foreign affairs ministry told the BBC. If it fails to do so, Canada and the coalition countries will move to litigate the issue before the International Court of Justice.  The move is a big step forward for the victims' families, who say the fight for accountability has consumed their daily lives in the last three years.  \"I used to like to travel, I used to go golfing, but I don't enjoy it any more,\" said Kourosh Doustshenas, a Winnipeg man who lost his fianc\u00e9e, Forough Khadem, on Flight 752.  \"What I do now is I want to make sure: could I write another letter to somebody? Did I forget something?\" \"On a personal level, I need closure, and the only way I can have closure in my life is if I know the truth.\"",

            "text": "British low-cost airline Monarch has gone out of business, leaving thousands of employees  without a job.  They had no warning. But some people in the aviation business aren't totally surprised by the news. \"It's a reflection on the industry,\" says Phil Flower from the Independent Pilots Association, a trade union for pilots.  \"It's a race to the bottom in terms of prices.\" Monarch check-in desks stand empty today following the announcement by the airline. The intense competition means that airlines - especially low-cost carriers - try to reduce costs as much as possible. Those cuts have an impact on employees. Phil Flower says it's particularly difficult for young pilots, who he compares to Uber drivers in terms of their employment rights. He warns that as a result, \"there is a crisis coming up in terms of pilot numbers.  \"Many young pilots are now in a gig-economy-type situation.\" Because they're trying to keep their own costs down, Phil Flower says many airlines won't pay for pilots' training - which can cost over \u00a3100,000 in total. Aspiring pilots can get bank loans for this - but many may already be in debt from university, and can't work in the year it takes to get a frozen Airline Transport Pilots Licence (ATPL). That's the first step to being able to fly a commercial jet. \"More and more, we're seeing young pilots relying on the bank of mum and dad because airlines won't pay for training,\" says Phil Flower. He says this means that the number of new pilots is reduced to those who can afford it.  After the huge expense and long training period, pilots starting at budget airlines like Monarch may only get paid between \u00a320,000 and \u00a322,000, says Phil Flower. \"The ambition for young pilots at low-cost carriers is definitely to move up to one of the more established airlines in the future,\" he says. Meanwhile, Monarch pilots could find it harder to find a new job straight away because the peak summer season has just come to an end. Lots of people are suggesting that Ryanair - who have had to cancel thousands of flights because of a lack of available pilots - could just hire the ex-Monarch flight crew. This isn't as easy as it sounds because the two airlines use different types of planes.  Monarch almost exclusively used planes made by Airbus, while Ryanair only uses one type of Boeing aircraft. Pilots can't just switch from one to another - they would have to retrain to be able to fly a new kind of plane.

Among the deadliest: However, the picture has been improving generally over the past 20 years.  \"If the accident rate had remained the same as 10 years ago there would have been 39 fatal accidents last year,\" ASN CEO Harro Ranter said.  \"At the accident rate of the year 2000, there would have been even 64 fatal accidents. This shows the enormous progress in terms of safety in the past two decades.\" But ASN said what it terms loss-of-control (LOC) accidents were a major safety concern for the aviation industry as these accounted for at least 10 of the worst 25 accidents in the past five years.  LOC refers to an unrecoverable deviation from an intended flight path, and can be caused by mechanical failure, human actions or environmental disturbances.  Most of those accidents were not survivable, says the ASN. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the 2018 air crash in Cuba happened in July. It also said human error was to blame but this was the view of the Mexican charter company that owns the plane. That view was criticised by a Mexican pilots' union and the official Cuban investigation has yet to reach a conclusion. ",

            "text": "For Hamed Esmaeilion, life took a tragic turn two years ago, when his wife, Parisa Eghbalian, and their nine-year-old daughter Reera took off from Tehran aboard Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 to head back to Canada via Kyiv. \"I was preparing the house for them to come back,\" Mr Esmaeilion recalls, so it would be ready for when he would pick them up from the airport the next day.  He would never see them alive again. \"Now my life is empty. 'Emptiness' is the word,\" Mr Esmaeilion told the BBC. \"That's the only thing I live with. It's the only thing I can focus on.\" Both Parisa and Reera were among the 176 people killed when a pair of Iranian anti-aircraft missiles struck the airliner on 8 January 2020, sending it plummeting into a park and fields about nine miles (15km) north of the airport in Tehran.  The incident came amid heightened tensions in the region following the US killing of top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad and a retaliatory Iranian missile strike at Iraqi bases hosting US forces. Mr Esmaeilion and others who have lost loved ones say they are still seeking justice - and hoping the Canadian government does more to help. \"The only thing I have now is this case,\" said Mr Esmaeilion, now the president and spokesman of the Canada-based Association of Families of Flight PS752 Victims. \"It's the same for the majority of the family members.\" Of those who perished in the downing of the plane, 138 had ties to Canada, including 55 citizens and 30 permanent residents. The dead included 29 children, 53 university students, four newlywed couples, and eight entire families. A document released by Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation in March reiterated the government's claim - first made the previous year - that \"human error\" was to blame for the downing of the airliner.  Later in June, the Canadian government released the findings of a report into the downing of PS752, which found that while Iran's government was \"fully responsible\", there was no evidence to suggest that that the incident was premeditated. And in November, Iran's judiciary announced that 10 Iranian military personnel were facing court proceedings for the downing of PS752. The families of those killed have yet to be told who the men on trial are and what role they are alleged to have played. Hearings in the trial are expected to continue into 2022.  Ukraine's ambassador in Tehran was invited to attend the trial, but declined, citing Iran's failure to meet its \"obligations under international law\" and provide information. The Canadian report stands in stark contrast to another released by the Association of Families. It accuses Iran of using passenger flights \"as human shields against possible American attacks, by deliberately not closing the [Iranian] airspace to civilian flights\". The report also accuses Iranian authorities of tampering with electronic devices found in the wreckage of PS752 and of mishandling and misidentifying the remains of victims. The Iranian Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC. Edmonton resident Daniel Ghods-Esfahani - whose 21-year-old girlfriend, Saba Saadat, died on PS752 along with her sister and mother - told the BBC that family members of the victims \"don't have many expectations\" from the Iranian government. \"Just look at the nature of that regime. They're not known to be very transparent about their doings,\" he said. \"Justice doesn't even seem to be a word in their vocabulary.\" On the other hand, Mr Ghods-Esfahani said that the families have \"high expectations\" from the Canadian government. \"As a Canadian myself, I expect the government to stand up for its citizens and to stand up for the ideals of justice,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, in the past few years, we haven't had the Canadian government doing that to a very effective extent.\" The family members of the victims want the government to increase pressure on Iran to release more evidence, an international investigation and appeal to the International Court of Justice and International Criminal Court, or to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). They want a criminal investigation to be opened by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, economic sanctions aimed at specific Iranian officials and the inclusion of the entire Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on Canada's list of designated terrorist organisations. Currently, only the IRGC's Quds Force - which manages its clandestine operations abroad - is included.  In an effort to hold someone accountable for the downing of PS752, family members of the fallen have taken a variety of different legal pathways, with targets including Ukrainian Airlines, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and missile operator 'John Doe'. On 3 January, an Ontario court awarded $107m (\u00a379m) in damages to the families of six victims after the judge deemed the incident to be an intentional act of terrorism. A lawyer representing the plaintiffs, Mark Arnold, later told CBC News that collecting the money would be very difficult and that he's \"begging\" Canada to collaborate with families to hold Iran accountable.  Simultaneously Canada - along with the Ukraine, UK and Sweden - has sought reparations from the Iranian government under international law. Iran so far refused to negotiate. On 6 January, all four countries involved announced that they were abandoning these efforts, saying they had determined that attempts to negotiate with Iran are \"futile\" and vowing to \"focus on subsequent actions to take to resolve this matter in accordance with international law\". The countries did not specify what additional steps they would be considering in the future. In a statement sent to the BBC, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada called the downing of PS752 a \"Canadian tragedy\" and said they \"remain committed to seeking answers and pursuing justice\". Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also met privately with the families on Friday.  For some of those who lost family members or friends in the disaster, Canada's response has been inadequate.  \"We want them to fight for Canadians,\" Mr Esmaeilion said. \"This is the second worst terrorist attack against Canadians in the history of Canada\u2026.they could have done much more. We're still waiting.\"  In the meantime, households and entire communities across Canada have been left without answers. Among the towns most impacted was Edmonton, where the tight-knit Iranian-Canadian community lost 13 of its members. \"The biggest thing that I think really shocked everyone was that it was really easy for every single Iranian-Canadian in Canada to see that it could have been them,\" said Reza Akbari, the former president of the Iranian Heritage Society of Edmonton. As an example, Mr Akbari - who lost a friend on PS752 - recalled that his wife had flown from Tehran a little more than two weeks before the crash. He said they had discussed the possibility of her staying in Iran longer and booking a ticket on PS752. \"I still get goosebumps and shake when I think about it,\" he added. \"Our life could have ended up totally different.\" Mr Esmaeilion, for his part, said the search for justice is the only thing that drives him forward two years on. \"It's not only me. All the family members now are like airline technicians and international lawyers,\" he added. \"I can't even focus on reading a book. That's gone. But if something is related to the airplane, I can swallow it.\" \"This is the most important thing. That's my life.\"",

            "text": "The US regulator for airline safety has said he is \"pleased\" with progress made by Boeing as it works to get its 737 Max plane re-approved for flight. The aircraft has been grounded since March 2019, following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. Boeing recently said the jet might not return to service until mid-2020. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief Steve Dickson said his agency \"has no set timeframe\" to complete its review. He issued the statement following a Reuters report that he had told airlines that Boeing's public timeline was \"very conservative\" and that re-certification could come before July. The news sent shares in Boeing up 2% on Friday.  The firm has been in crisis since the crashes, which occurred within five months of each other - first in Indonesia in October 2018 and then in Ethiopia last March. It is facing multiple investigations amid accusations that it sacrificed safety as it rushed to get its jets to customers. The FAA has also been accused of failing its oversight duty, due to a too-cosy relationship with Boeing. The grounding of the 737 Max, which had been Boeing's best-selling plane, is estimated to have cost Boeing more than $9bn already.  Last month, Boeing  said it would halt production - a move that analysts say could shave 0.5% off US economic growth in the first three months of the year.  Suppliers have announced job cuts and airlines are grappling with schedule shifts. Many of the airlines have said they do not expect the 737 planes back in service before at least June.",

            "title": "Bombardier to partner Airbus on C-Series jets",
            "text": "European aerospace firm Airbus is to take a majority stake in Bombardier's C-Series jet project. Bombardier has faced a series of problems over the plane, most recently a trade dispute in the US that imposed a 300% import tariff. Bombardier's Northern Ireland's director Michael Ryan said the deal was \"great news\" for the Belfast operation. About 1,000 staff work on the C-Series at a purpose-built factory in Belfast, mostly making the plane's wings. Airbus and Bombardier's chief executives said the deal - which will see Airbus take a 50.01% stake - would help to boost sales.    The deal also gives Airbus the right to buy full control of the C-Series project in 2023. Experts have hailed the deal as hugely significant and described it as akin to a supervolcano exploding in the aviation world.  BBC Northern Ireland's business and economics editor John Campbell said Airbus had effectively taken control of the C-Series project in a transformational deal.  He said it would use its financial muscle in procurement and sales, while Bombardier's manufacturing operations would continue to build the planes. It's perhaps symptomatic of the difficulties the C-Series has faced that Airbus will not have to hand over any cash for its 50% stake. The hope will be that Airbus' financial muscle will finally put an end to those difficulties. In particular, Airbus thinks it can solve the C-Series tariff problem by assembling the plane for US customers inside the US at its factory in Alabama. But, as trade expert Simon Lester of the Cato Institute pointed out to me, it may not be that straightforward. That's because of something known as \"trade circumvention\" - in crude terms, when a company tries to avoid tariffs by superficially changing the country of origin of its products. Will the US trade authorities (and Boeing) see an Alabama-assembled C-Series as an attempt at circumvention? Davy Thompson, from the trade union Unite, said the deal was a \"welcome development\". \"My understanding of the deal, and what it means for Belfast, is the supply chain still seems to be what it is today, which would mean Belfast is integral to the overall process. \"That should, we believe, increase and assure people's jobs down in the C-Series plan, but there are still further challenges.\" He said there were still some \"concerns\" over non-C-Series related contracts at Bombardier's Belfast plant, but the deal with Airbus should \"allow for more orders to be placed\" and help with long-term employment across the site.  The union GMB said it was potentially good news but that the \"devil was in the detail\". \"This deal is liable to further scrutiny from the US administration that may see it as an attempt to dodge their trade tariffs,\" said Ross Murdoch, GMB national officer. \"GMB hopes both Bombardier and Airbus have taken cast iron legal advice to ensure they don't get rid on one legal challenge only to open themselves up to another.\" Bombardier was accused of anti-competitive practices by rival Boeing, which complained to the US authorities. Boeing accused the Canadian firm of selling the jets below cost price after taking state subsidies from Canada and the UK. The firm said the agreement with Airbus \"looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidized competitors to skirt the recent findings of the US government\". \"Our position remains that everyone should play by the same rules for free and fair trade to work,\" it added. Phil Musser, Boeing's senior vice president of communications, tweeted: \"If @Airbus and @Bombardier think this deal will get them around the rules...#thinkagain\" UK Business Secretary Greg Clark said the Airbus tie-up was a \"positive step forward\". Mr Clark said the UK and Canadian governments had been working to \"safeguard jobs and manufacturing at Bombardier Shorts in Belfast, and the supply chain across the UK\". The government was still pushing for a \"swift resolution\" to the Boeing dispute, he added. Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, said she hoped the deal would \"safeguard\" the C-Series programme. \"I'm thrilled there is a bright future ahead following what has been a dark time for staff and management,\" she added.  Sinn F\u00e9in's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill said the deal was a \"good news story for Bombardier\" that would \"come as a relief to the workers and their families and all those local businesses involved in the Bombardier supply chain\". Labour's Owen Smith, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said the deal \"looked good for both Bombardier and Belfast\". \"Boeing's bullying has united its rivals and hopefully secured the jobs,\" he tweeted. The French government, which owns an 11% stake in Airbus, also welcomed the deal. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said it made Airbus and the European aircraft manufacturing industry \"stronger\".",

            "text": "Indian airline SpiceJet is turning to seaplanes to boost travel during the pandemic downturn. The country's biggest regional airline has approval for 18 seaplane routes.  One of these routes is to Kevadia, the site of the world's tallest statue - an 182-metre tribute to the country's first home minister, Vallabhbhai Patel. During the pandemic, SpiceJet is focusing on new sources of revenue, including transporting cargo and regional flights using smaller planes. Airlines have struggled during the coronavirus to remain profitable and many have gone bust, including the UK's Flybe and Virgin Australia. Many others are on the brink of survival and have made severe job cuts. Some airlines have been looking at alternative ways of generating revenue. These include flights to nowhere and airplane meal delivery. SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh said the seaplanes would help improve regional connectivity - an initiative being encouraged by the Indian government - \"without the high cost of building airports and runways\", thanks to the planes being able to take-off and land both on small water bodies and short airstrips. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to join the first flights from Ahmedabad to Kevadia on Saturday, the 145th anniversary of Vallabhbhai Patel's birth. The landmark built in his honour, referred to as the Statue of Unity, sits in the state of Gujarat and is double the height of the Statue of Liberty. The 30-minute flights will operate through its subsidiary Spice Shuttle and start from 1,500 rupees (\u00a315.40) one-way. SpiceJet will be using Twin Otter 300 seaplanes, built by planemaker de Havilland Canada. They can seat up to 19 people, including passengers and crew. \"The Twin Otter is very popular among smaller operators, and is frequently used as a seaplane, most notably in the Maldives,\" said Greg Waldron at FlightGlobal magazine. \"Its small size allows it to reach locations that would not be accessible or practical for larger aircraft.\" SpiceJet started conducting seaplane trials in India in 2017 in Nagpur, Guwahati and Mumbai. It has been exploring air connectivity through water bodies such as rivers or inland waterways. During national lockdowns in India, SpiceJet remained active flying repatriation flights for more than 1m Indians.",

            "text": "Qantas has picked Airbus jets to fly its ultra long haul routes, dealing a blow to rival plane maker Boeing.  The airline selected the A350-1000 for its planned non-stop Sydney to London service, which would be the world's longest commercial flight. Qantas also delayed a final decision on whether to begin those, and other long haul services, until March 2020. Still, the win for Airbus comes as Boeing deals with the grounding of its 737 Max fleet after two deadly crashes.  Qantas has been testing the ultra long haul flights as part of its \"Project Sunrise\" plan.  Two years ago, the airline challenged the world's two biggest plane makers to design passenger jets for the project that could fly in excess of 10,500 miles (17,000km), which means being in the air for up to 20 hours. \"After detailed evaluation of the Boeing 777X and Airbus A350, Qantas has selected the A350-1000 as the preferred aircraft if Sunrise proceeds,\" the airline said in a statement.  The Australian carrier said it would work closely with Airbus on a deal for as many as 12 aircraft, but no orders have yet been placed.  Qantas wants to run direct services from Australia's east coast to London, New York, Paris, Frankfurt as well as destinations in Latin America and Africa.  It has conducted several test flights to find out whether passengers and crew are able to withstand the marathon journeys. Qantas will run its final trial flight from New York to Sydney later this month. If it goes ahead with the plan, services would start operating by 2023. Singapore Airlines operates the world's current longest flight, a near 19 hour journey from Singapore to New York, on the A350-900.  The decision by Qantas to opt for Airbus over Boeing comes as the US plane maker remains engulfed in crisis over the grounding of its 737 Max fleet.  It was Boeing's best-selling model until it was forced to stop flying earlier this year after two crashes involving the jet killed 346 people. The firm is now attempting to get approval for software fixes to the aircraft's flight-control system, which was identified as a key factor in the disasters.",

On the second day of the Dubai Air Show, Emirates announced the purchase of 50 Airbus A350-900 XWBs - extra wide body - planes at a list price of $16bn. That was closely followed by fast-growing low-cost carrier Air Arabia ordering 170 Airbus A320s worth $14bn.  The European aircraft manufacturer makes its wings in the UK. Both airlines are likely to get a discount on the catalogue price, given the size of the orders.  Air Arabia chief executive Adel Ali told reporters the aircraft order was a \"game-changer\" for the airline. He said it would allow Air Arabia to expand in southeast Asia and Africa. Meanwhile, Emirates said its order, announced at a hastily-convened news conference after last-minute negotiations, will be used to help re-shape its fleet as the airline adjusts to a slowing regional market and the early end to production of the A380 super-jumbo jet.  Emirates is the biggest operator of the A380, with more than 100 of the aircraft in its fleet. The airline's chairman and chief executive, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, said the A350s would allow Emirates to expand its long-haul network. The first of the A350 aircraft, which flies up to 15 hours and carries 350 passengers, will be delivered in 2023. \"It is very good news for Airbus,\" the European aerospace giant's chief executive, Guillaume Faury, told the news conference. He added that there would be no reversal of the decision earlier this year to end  production of the A380. Emirates said the airline was still in talks with Airbus rival Boeing about buying more aircraft from the US manufacturer. Sheikh Ahmed said talks were continuing with Boeing at the air show, with everything up for discussion, including when the US aerospace giant might resolve issues around its 737 Max, currently grounded after two crashes. Emirates has previously said it could buy 40 of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners, but has yet to firm up the order.",

The kitchen also features plane cabin windows which can show landing footage. \"I have researched to see if anyone else has done a kitchen out of galley before and its seems I am the first to upcycle a complete galley into a working kitchen anywhere in the world,\" Mr Mellon, 53, said. \"I am a private chef by trade and that came to a halt with lockdown. \"I needed a massive amount of storage in my tiny little property. I found this unit on eBay and bought it for \u00a3149. It came up from Birmingham on a van - it is a stunning piece of kit. \"The galley can hold 1,000 items in just a 8ft by 4ft space, due to the amazing engineering of the unit - a super-efficient storage system.\" He did not manage to trace which exact Boeing 737 it came from. Clouds made of stainless steel have also been added to the ceiling to add to the aviation effect, alongside cooking facilities. \"Nobody is expecting to see this in Banff,\" he said. \"I am totally off grid, not connected to electricity at all, just two roof-mounted solar panels provide enough power.\" He said the novelty value meant he could also rent out the property as a self-catering option. \"And of course it's an upcycle rather than it going to landfill,\" Mr Mellon added. \"It looks amazing.\"",

            "title": "Wasps and bees in probes prevented Heathrow summer flights",
            "text": "Eight passenger planes were infested by insects which caused abandoned take-offs at Heathrow Airport last summer. Wasp and bee nests blocked speed-measuring pitot probes on six British Airways aircraft and one Virgin Atlantic jet, according to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB). A wasp was also spotted inside a probe on another British Airways plane during the same three-week period. The \"temporary surge\" was due to fewer flights during the pandemic. Aircraft remaining on the ground for longer periods between flights created an \"attractive opportunity\" for insects as pitot probes are an \"ideal construction site for nests\", the AAIB report said. British Airways crews on board two of the planes were forced to abort take-offs while speeding down runways because the blockages caused inaccurate speed readings on cockpit displays. Unreliable speed indication is a \"serious hazard\", investigators warned. The AAIB said the high level of insect activity in 2021 could lead to a \"larger number of insects emerging in the spring of 2022\", so the risk of more probe blockages \"could be significant\". The Civil Aviation Authority, Heathrow Airport and affected airlines have taken measures to reduce the risk of the problem reoccurring, such as increasing the frequency of inspections, issuing alerts to aviation firms and using probe covers. A British Airways spokesman said: \"Safety is our highest priority and in each case the flights returned safely to stand. \"Our highly skilled pilots are trained to safely perform this type of standard procedure and practise them regularly.\" The blockages were discovered between June 9 and July 1 last year. The issue of insects blocking pitot probes is \"not new\", but it is \"unusual for such a spate of events to occur in such a short timeframe\", the AAIB said. Fewer aircraft movements, less road traffic around the airport and an overall cut in human activity resulted in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide but a spike in ground-level ozone. The latter is a dangerous air pollutant, which can cause wasps and bees to travel further than normal. The AAIB said the incidents should act as a reminder that \"the environmental response to changes in human behaviour can be unpredictable and have unforeseen consequences\". It added that the drive towards greener aviation and urban areas will result in quieter, cleaner aircraft and less polluting airports, which provide \"the kind of environments that prove attractive to insects such as bees and wasps\".

            "text": "Australia's biggest airline, Qantas Airways, has delivered its second highest profit in its 97-year history. Pre-tax profit came in at A$1.4 billion (\u00a3860m; $1.11 bn) for the year to the end of June. The airline's highest ever profit was delivered the previous year. Although down nearly 9% from that record, Chief Executive Alan Joyce says the company's turnaround is complete.   The strong result is down to cost cuts and its robust domestic business which helped offset global competition. \"Three years ago, we started an ambitious turnaround program to make the Qantas Group strong and profitable. We tackled some difficult structural issues, became a lot more efficient and kept improving customer service. \"Today's announcements show this plan has well-and-truly paid off,\" Mr Joyce said in a statement.  Qantas also confirmed plans to sell non-stop flights from Sydney to London and New York by 2022. But the plan will depend on the airline securing planes from Airbus or Boeing that are capable of travelling the distance. \"From next year we will be flying direct from Perth to London, which is a huge leap forward,\" Mr Joyce said.  \"We believe advances in technology in the next few years will make Sydney to London direct a possibility,\" Mr Joyce said in a statement.",

            "title": "Singapore Airshow: Asia aviation in five charts",
            "text": "Asia's airlines have more new planes on order than anyone else. Its airports are some of the fastest-growing in the world. And the region is also home to the most popular aircraft journey on the planet. With Asia's largest air show taking place in Singapore, we've been taking a look at the region's aviation industry.  Asia is the world's dominant region for air travel. Of all the passengers which airlines carried globally in 2016, 35% flew on Asian carriers. And that market share is going to grow. Every year, tens of millions of Chinese travellers choose to take an aeroplane for the first time. Airline body IATA forecasts China will comfortably overtake the US in the next two decades to become the biggest aviation market. While there were about 537 million passenger journeys in 2016, that's predicted to hit 1.46 billion by 2036. And as you can see from the chart, Indian passenger numbers are expected to more than treble, though it is starting from a relatively low base. \"Growing incomes, a burgeoning middle class and peaking working age populations... has translated into the rapid rise in the propensity to travel,\" says Angela Gittens, director general of Airports Council International World.  More travellers generally means busier airports (as well as new ones being built). And Asia has eight of the ten fastest growing airports on the planet, according to Airports Council International. Of those eight, six are in eastern Chinese cities like Tianjin, Zhengzhou, Harbin and Chongqing. Tianjin, for example, had just 2.7 million passengers in 2006 but in 2016 it saw more than 16.8 million people using it. Remember though, busier isn't always better. China has one of the worst records for on-time departures in the world.  Indonesia also has some rapidly expanding airports, including Surabaya and Denpasar in Bali.  While the latter is an indicator how much the holiday island has become a  destination for tourists, Surabaya's growth is largely down to Indonesia's booming domestic aviation market.   When measured by volume of passengers, Beijing and Tokyo Haneda and Shanghai all make the list of the world's top ten busiest airports - a list that is incidentally topped by Atlanta.  If you want to see which carriers are expanding the fastest, there's no perfect measurement. But one decent indicator is to look at outstanding orders for new planes. It's a snapshot of which airlines are going to grow. We've trawled the data available from Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier and Embraer. And studying this backlog (the difference between planes ordered and planes delivered) shows that it's Asian airlines who have the biggest future orders. Using this measurement, Malaysia's AirAsia is currently Airbus's biggest customer, with 472 aircraft still to be delivered. Meanwhile Lion Air, an Indonesian low cost carrier, has split its business between Airbus and Boeing, and is waiting for 381 planes.  And in India, you can see the country's airlines positioning themselves to capture the growth in domestic travel as more affluent, time-conscious travellers get off the railways and into the skies.  Indigo has almost 400 Airbus planes due (mainly A320neo) while Spicejet is waiting on 167 jets, some from Bombardier but mainly from Boeing. GoAir and Jet Airways also have sizeable backlogs.  If you're wondering why Chinese carriers aren't on the chart, the answer is partly that China's early expansion phase is over and its biggest carriers already have large fleets.  There are more on the way of course, with both Airbus and Boeing desperate to tap into that demand. But the volumes of outstanding orders is far lower than the airlines mentioned above. But for a reminder that Asia is playing catch-up, check this chart. As you can see, US airlines are still carrying more passengers than anyone else. Only China Southern represents Asia in the top five. And another fun fact, the airline with the biggest fleet of passenger jets is American Airlines which has about 1,500 planes. If you were asked to guess which was the world's busiest air route, the chances are you wouldn't get it right. If you were told it was in Asia, perhaps you'd take a stab at Hong Kong to Bangkok or Mumbai to Delhi. But as the chart shows, that title is held - quite convincingly - by a domestic flight within South Korea, between the capital Seoul and Jeju, an island in the south. In 2016 (the last year for which complete figures are available) - 11.7 million passengers travelled on the route. There are almost 200 flights a day covering a journey that takes about an hour and five minutes.  It'll be interesting to see whether the passenger number falls for 2017. With its beaches, volcanic craters and hiking trails Jeju is a huge tourism destination, and Chinese travellers have traditionally been among the most frequent foreign visitors. South Korean tourism figures show that the number of Chinese visitors halved last year from 2016, following Beijing's ban on the sale of package holidays to the country - in a dispute over Seoul's support for a US anti-missile shield. But even if numbers do come down, it's likely to remain the world's busiest route. And that means its popularity is a quirky fact that you can use to impress your friends for years to come.

            "title": "Boeing faces fine for 737 Max plane 'designed by clowns'",
            "text": "US regulators are seeking to fine Boeing $5.4m (\u00a34.14m) for \"knowingly\" installing faulty parts on 737 Max planes. The move comes after the release of internal messages that raised more questions about the jet's safety. In one of the communications, an employee said the plane was \"designed by clowns\". Boeing has been under scrutiny since the fatal crashes of two 737 Max planes, which killed 346 people. The fine announced by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Friday is not connected to the software system that investigators have implicated in those crashes. It concerns \"slat tracks\" that are located on the wings. The FAA said the company submitted the jets for FAA approval despite determining that the wing parts had failed a strength test. It also accused Boeing of failing to oversee its suppliers properly. The planemaker has the right to contest the penalty, which follows a $3.9m fine the FAA proposed against the US aerospace giant for similar reasons last month. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The announcement heightens the pressure on the company, which is now facing multiple investigations following the 737 Max crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.  Last month, the company fired chief executive Dennis Muilenburg. The firm said Friday it had denied him severance and that he had forfeited stock awards worth about $14.6m.   As part of the investigations, Boeing has provided hundreds of messages to the FAA and Congress. It said it had released redacted versions this week as part of its commitment to transparency. \"These communications do not reflect the company we are and need to be, and they are completely unacceptable,\" Boeing said. In one exchange in April 2017, an unnamed employee wrote: \"This airplane is designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys.\" The documents also showed Boeing planning to push back against requirements that 737 Max pilots receive training on simulators, which would have led to higher costs for its customers, making its aircraft less attractive. \"I want to stress the importance of holding firm that there will not be any type of simulator training required to transition from NG to Max,\" Boeing's 737 chief technical pilot at the time, Mark Forkner, said in a March 2017 email. \"Boeing will not allow that to happen. We'll go face to face with any regulator who tries to make that a requirement.\" On Tuesday this week, Boeing reversed its position by recommending 737 Max simulator training for all pilots. These messages refer to Boeing employees telling lies, covering up problems and treating regulators with contempt. They reinforce the impression - already expressed vividly by whistleblowers and in Congressional hearings - that Boeing was a company that had lost its way, focused on maximising production and keeping costs down, rather than on safety. Will all this actually harm Boeing though? It's questionable. The company's reputation has already been savaged; it may be calculating that it now has little to lose by being transparent about past failures. But it is easy to see now why the relationship between Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration has deteriorated so far - and why the recertification of the 737 Max has taken so long. Staff also appear to discuss problems with the simulators. In February 2018, a Boeing worker asked a colleague: \"Would you put your family on a Max simulator-trained aircraft? I wouldn't.\" \"No,\" came the reply. Boeing has said it is redesigning the automated control system thought to have been the primary cause of the crashes.  But 737 Max planes have been grounded worldwide since March and with no sign from regulators that the aircraft will be re-approved for flight anytime soon, the firm has been forced to halt production of the planes. On Friday, the economic costs started to be felt as Spirit Aerosystems, a major Boeing supplier, said it would cut 2,800 jobs at a plant in Kansas, and expected smaller layoffs at some of its other factories. \"Spirit is taking this action because of the 737 MAX production suspension and ongoing uncertainty regarding the timing of when production will resume and the level of production when it does resume,\" the company said in a statement, which noted that Boeing has hundreds of 737 planes in storage. The FAA said of the emails that safety problems had been addressed. However, the regulator added: \"The tone and content of some of the language contained in the documents is disappointing.\" In the emails and instant messages, employees spoke of their frustration with the company's culture, complaining about the drive to find the cheapest suppliers and \"impossible schedules\". \"I don't know how to fix these things... it's systemic. It's culture. It's the fact we have a senior leadership team that understand very little about the business and yet are driving us to certain objectives,\" said an employee in an email dated June 2018. And in a May 2018 message, an unnamed Boeing employee said: \"I still haven't been forgiven by God for the covering up I did last year.\" Without citing what was covered up, the employee added: \"Can't do it one more time, the pearly gates will be closed.\" Boeing said that some of the messages \"raise questions\" about the company's interactions with the FAA in discussions about the simulator. But the company dismissed safety concerns, saying that the issues raised in the emails occurred at the start of the simulators. It said: \"We remain confident in the regulatory process for qualifying these simulators.\"",

            "text": "Boeing has warned airlines about potential flaws on the wings of some 737 aircraft, including on the new-generation 737 Max that was grounded after two crashes. The company has identified possible faulty parts on more than 300 aircraft worldwide. The parts, called wing slats, generate extra lift on take-off and landing. Affected parts may be susceptible to premature failure or cracks, the US aviation regulator said. The Federal Aviation Administration Authority (FAA) added that the issue arose due to an \"improper manufacturing process\". According to the FAA's statement, the defective parts were manufactured by a subcontractor not Boeing. The president and chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Kevin McAllister, said in a statement: \"We are committed to supporting our customers in every way possible as they identify and replace these potentially non-conforming tracks.\" Boeing chairman and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg told CNBC the company was dealing with the issue \"expeditiously\", adding: \"Certainly it is something we regret, the impact it has had to our customers. \"Any time there is news on the 737, it is something that goes to the top of our list, we're paying close attention to it.\"  News of the potentially faulty wing parts prompted a 1.6% fall in Boeing's share price at the start of trading, but the stock partially recovered to finish 0.8% down.  The latest issue comes as the planemaker grapples with the consequences of the 737 Max grounding. The planes were grounded worldwide after a combined 346 people died in two crashes, the first in Indonesia in October followed by one in Ethiopia in March. That also knocked the reputation of the FAA amid questions over its oversight during the flight certification process of the Max. Boeing is working on a software fix that will allow the Max to begin flying again, but differences have arisen between the US and Canada on how to train pilots on the software after the update. Washington believes training on computers or tablets is sufficient for seasoned pilots, but Ottawa wants to require training on flight simulators. Other regulators around the world are trying to work on a coordinated plan to get the Max back into the skies.",

The crew was aware of where the plane was flying and a separate system was showing its correct position.  The pilots took manual control and the plane was landed safely at Edinburgh. Six crew and 177 passengers were on the flight from Portugal in October 2018. The false information show up on a system used by the pilots. The crew was well aware of where the aircraft was and another GPS-equipped computer system was correctly showing its actual position.  A newly-published Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) report said the plane's attitude indicator malfunctioned and this affected \"numerous aircraft systems\". The false position information led to incorrect details showing on the aircraft commander's main flight display and the autopilot responded by \"initiating a slow climb\".

            "title": "Cuba plane crash: Black box recovered in 'good condition'",
            "text": "Cuban officials say they have found one of the two black boxes from a plane that crashed near Havana airport, killing more than 100 people, in \"good condition\". Transport Minister Adel Yzquierdo says he hopes the second device will be recovered soon. He revised the official death toll up to 110 people, including 11 foreigners. Three women survived the crash, but are said to be in a critical condition with serious burns.  The incident is Cuba's worst air disaster in decades, and two days of national mourning began on Saturday.  Officials said investigators are combing through the wreckage of the plane, a Boeing 737 which was nearly 40 years old, at the field where it crashed some 20km (12 miles) south of the Cuban capital.  The black box which has already been recovered will hold key flight data and information about what happened to the plane.  Mr Yzquierdo told journalists that the 110 dead included 99 Cubans, six Mexican crew members, two tourists from Argentina, one from Mexico, and two passengers from Western Sahara. The Argentine couple were named by their government as Dora Beatriz Cifuentes and Oscar Hugo Almaras, both in their sixties.  Several victims' relatives have travelled to Havana to help identify the deceased.  Those coming from Holgu\u00edn - the plane's intended destination - and other eastern parts of Cuba made the 700km (435-mile) trip on buses, escorted by the National Revolutionary Police, EFE news agency reported.  President Miguel Diaz-Canel has visited the morgue where the victims are being identified. Cuban authorities do not plan to release the full list of the dead until all victims' families have been informed.  The Boeing 737-201 crashed at 12:08 (16:08 GMT) on Friday, shortly after taking off from Havana on an internal flight to Holgu\u00edn. It's too early to say what caused the crash, but eyewitnesses on the ground described seeing the jet burst into flames before crashing into a field close to a wooded area near the airport. \"I saw it taking off,\" supermarket worker Jose Luis told the AFP news agency. \"All of a sudden, it made a turn, and went down. We were all amazed.\" \"We heard an explosion and then saw a big cloud of smoke go up,\" Gilberto Menendez, who runs a restaurant near the crash site, told Reuters. Mexico's transport department said on its website that \"during take-off (the plane) apparently suffered a problem and dived to the ground\". Boeing said that it was ready to send a technical team to Cuba, \"as permitted under US law and at the direction of the US National Transportation Safety Board and Cuban authorities\".  A US trade embargo has been in force against Cuba for many decades. Four people initially survived the crash but one died after being taken to hospital, the director of Havana's Calixto Garcia hospital, Carlos Alberto Martinez, told Reuters. The three survivors are all women, according to Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma: one aged between 18 and 25, one in her thirties and the third aged 39.  \"She is alive but very burnt and swollen,\" one of the women's relatives at the hospital told Reuters. By Will Grant, BBC Cuba Correspondent  Two days of national mourning have begun, with the entire island sharing a little of the pain of the many families affected by the disaster. But in their grief, people also want answers. They are demanding an explanation as to why a routine flight from Havana came crashing down in a field barely a minute after it took off, with over 100 passengers and crew on board.  The country's new President, Miguel Diaz-Canel, faces his first real test in providing those answers. He visited the crash site to thank the emergency services and announced an investigation was already under way.  It emerged that the previous President, Ra\u00fal Castro, was recuperating from minor surgery on a hernia, and he too expressed his condolences to the victims' families.  The families of the survivors face an anxious wait to see if they will pull through, and their countrymen are praying that at least some will have survived this catastrophe. The plane had been leased to state airline Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n by the Mexican company Aerolineas Damojh. The Mexican authorities said the plane was built in 1979 and had been successfully inspected last November. Mexico earlier said it was sending two civil aviation specialists to join the investigation. Aerolineas Damojh, also known as Global Air, has three planes in operation. According to industry research, last year was the safest in history for commercial airline travel with no passenger jet crashes. But there have been several serious air disasters this year. Cuba's deadliest air crash was in 1989, when a Soviet-made Ilyushin-62M passenger plane crashed near Havana, killing 126 people on board and another 24 people on the ground.",

            "text": "Profits at Airbus, Europe's largest aerospace company, more than doubled in the second quarter despite a slow start to 2018. Bottlenecks of undelivered planes began to ease, while costs relating to its newest big jet, the A350, were down. After a series of engine manufacturing issues caused delays, chief executive Tom Enders said deliveries had \"picked up\", but \"challenges remain\". The results sent Airbus shares to a new record high of \u20ac111 in Paris. The company has faced a backlog of up to 100 A320neo jets parked outside factories without their engines. Many of the engines, which have been beset by glitches, are made by US-based manufacturer Pratt & Whitney.  Earlier this month, Airbus said the firm was \"catching up\" and that there would be further improvement in the second half of the year. Airbus, which is based in Toulouse, said adjusted profits before interest and other charges rose 110% to \u20ac1.15bn (\u00a31.02bn) in the first half of 2018. However, net profit for the six months fell 55% to \u20ac496m. David Learmount, consulting editor at aviation publisher FlightGlobal, says Airbus have got the A350 program \"to a point where deliveries are going well. They've got to the sweet spot.\" The planemaker also reported orders and commitments for 431 aircraft during July's Farnborough Airshow, which are yet to be reflected in their figures.  Farnborough is a key international pageant for aircraft manufacturers. Meanwhile Boeing, Airbus's main market rival, predicts global demand for aircraft will be worth $6.3tn (\u00a34.8tn) in the next 20 years. \"The whole market is very healthy. And the reason is terribly simple - people like travelling,\" added Mr Learmount. \"The future of commercial air transport is pretty rosy.\" Shares in Airbus, which were trading at about \u20ac75 a year ago, were around 5% higher in morning trading, before falling back slightly.",

            "title": "Boeing launches new version of 737 jet",
            "text": "Boeing has maintained the pressure on Airbus, its main rival, with the launch of the biggest version yet of the 737 short-haul jet. The world's largest commercial aircraft maker announced plans for the 737 Max 10 at the Paris Air Show on Monday. The new variant of the plane can carry up to 230 passengers and already has more than 240 orders from 10 customers. Boeing says the new 737 will have the lowest operating costs of any single-aisle plane ever produced. \"The Max 10 will provide customers with even more flexibility in terms of airplane range and higher seat count,\" chief executive Dennis Muilenburg told the BBC. The US company has had about 3,700 orders for the 737 Max family, which ranges from the 172-seat Max 7 to the 220-seat Max 9. The Max 10 is 66 inches longer than the Max 9 at 143ft 8in (43.8m), but its slightly bigger passenger capacity means its range is 300 nautical miles less than the 3,515 of the Max 8 and 9.   Boeing is increasing 737 production from 42 to 47 planes a month by the end of this year and will reach 57 monthly by 2020 to meet demand, Mr Muilenburg says.  The 737 competes with the Airbus A320neo family of jets that the European manufacturer introduced last year, which has had about 4,600 orders. The neo range also offer airlines lower fuel consumption and more seats, with the A321neo carrying up to 240 passengers.   Boeing is also evaluating demand for a new plane that would sit in between the largest 737 variant, and the 787 Dreamliner, and come into service in about 2024-25 if it goes ahead. Mr Muilenburg said the aircraft being planned would have a range of about 5,000 nautical miles and carry in the region of 230 passengers - about 100 fewer than the biggest version of the Dreamliner. \"We see a potential need for about 4,000 aircraft in that market. We have time to figure it out and build the business case so we get it right.\"  The Boeing boss said there was an estimated demand for about 41,000 new commercial planes over the next two decades. Every year in Asia alone 100 million people fly for the first time, Mr Muilenburg said: \"That's what is fuelling our investments in the future and our increased production.\" Airlines in other regions, such as India and South America, are also buying thousands of new planes as the growing middle classes find air travel within their reach. Although Boeing and Airbus have the lion's share of the global commercial aviation market, they are facing competition from the likes of Bombardier of Canada, Brazil's Embraer and even lesser-known manufacturers such as COMAC of China and Russia's Irkut. However, Mr Muilenburg is not too concerned about the threat posed by these upstarts. \"Aerospace is outpacing global GDP, so we should expect new competitors. In the long run, competition makes us better\u2026 it drives innovation.\"",

            "text": "Experts are hailing a British Airways flight as the fastest subsonic New York to London journey. The Boeing 747-436 reached speeds of 825 mph (1,327 km/h) as it rode a jet stream accelerated by Storm Ciara. The four hours and 56 minutes flight arrived at Heathrow Airport 80 minutes ahead of schedule on Sunday morning.  According to Flightradar24, an online flight tracking service, it beat a previous five hours 13 minutes record held by Norwegian. The BBC has been unable to independently verify the record as no complete database of flight times was available.  Aviation consultant and former BA pilot Alastair Rosenschein said the aeroplane reached a \"phenomenal speed\". \"The pilot will have sat their aircraft in the core of the jet stream and at this time of year it's quite strong.  \"Turbulence in those jet streams can be quite severe, but you can also find it can be a very smooth journey.\" The jet stream reached speeds of 260 mph (418 km/h) on Sunday morning, according to BBC Weather.  Despite travelling faster than the speed of sound the plane would not have broken the sonic barrier as it was helped along by fast-moving air.  Relative to the air, the plane was travelling slower than 801mph.  Modern passenger planes usually travel at about 85% the speed of sound, according to Mr Rosenschein. British Airways said: \"We always prioritise safety over speed records. \"Our highly-trained pilots made the most of the conditions to get customers back to London well ahead of time.\" The fastest transatlantic civilian crossing belongs to BA Concorde, which flew from New York to London in two hours 52 minutes and 59 seconds in 1996 - hitting a top speed of 1,350 mph.",

            "title": "Iran plane crash: Tehran rebuffs claims it shot down Ukrainian jet",
            "text": "Iran has again rejected suggestions that one of its missiles brought down a Ukrainian passenger jet near the capital, Tehran, on Wednesday. Its civil aviation chief said on Friday he was \"certain\" that the plane was not hit by a missile. He was responding to claims by Western leaders that evidence suggested the plane had been hit by a surface-to-air missile, possibly in error. New video appeared to show a plane being hit by a projectile over Tehran. The crash of Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 with the loss of 176 lives came just hours after Iran carried out missile strikes on two airbases housing US forces in Iraq. US media have speculated that the airliner may have been mistaken for a warplane as Iran prepared for possible US retaliation. Victims of the crash included 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians as well as nationals from Sweden, the UK, Afghanistan and Germany. Iran has promised a full investigation. However, TV images from the crash site on Thursday showed a mechanical digger helping to clear debris away, raising concerns that important evidence could have been removed. Meanwhile, the so-called \"black box\" recovered from the wreckage will be opened on Friday, Iran's official Irna news agency reported. Iran said it would download the information itself, adding that the process could take up to two months. Black boxes contain the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, and could provide vital clues about what caused the crash. At a news conference on Friday, Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation (CAOI) chief Ali Abedzadeh repeated his view that a missile was not the cause of the crash. \"The thing that is clear to us and that we can say with certainty is that this plane was not hit by a missile,\" he told reporters. \"As I said last night, this plane for more than one and a half minutes was on fire and was in the air, and the location shows that the pilot was attempting to return.\" On Thursday, government spokesman Ali Rabiei accused the US and its allies of \"lying and engaging in psychological warfare\" in their speculation over the cause of the accident. An Iranian official told the BBC on Friday that there was documentation to prove that the plane had a mechanical issue before take-off. It was not signed off for flying, but Ukrainian airline officials had overruled these objections, the official said, without giving further details. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had received intelligence from multiple sources indicating the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, adding that it was possible that this was unintentional. \"This reinforces the need for a thorough investigation,\" he said. \"Canadians have questions and they deserve answers.\" But he said it was too early to apportion blame or draw any conclusions, and refused to go into detail about the evidence. The Ukrainian flight was headed to the Canadian city of Toronto via the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson echoed Mr Trudeau's words and said Britain was working closely with Canada and other international partners affected by the crash. Speaking in Canada, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said British nationals were advised not to travel to Iran, \"given the body of information that UIA Flight 752 was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, and the heightened tensions\". Newsweek quoted a Pentagon and senior US intelligence officials, as well as an Iraqi intelligence official, as saying they believed flight PS752 was hit by a Russian-made Tor missile. Ukraine said on Friday that the US had passed on \"important data\" about the crash to President's Volodymyr Zelensky, without providing any further details. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo later said he spoke with Mr Zelensky to express his \"deepest condolences for the lives lost in the tragic crash\". Video obtained by the New York Times appeared to show a missile streaking across the night sky over Tehran and then exploding on contact with a plane. About 10 seconds later, a loud explosion is heard on the ground.  Iran initially said it would not hand over the recovered \"black boxes\" to Boeing, the plane's manufacturer, or to the US. This followed the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone attack on 3 January and the subsequent strikes against US bases in Iraq on Wednesday. However, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) later confirmed it had been invited to take part in the investigation and would send a representative. Boeing said it would support the NTSB in the inquiry, and the Transportation Safety Board of Canada said it had also been invited to the accident site by Tehran. France's BEA air accident agency said on Friday it had also been invited to take part in the investigation.",

            "text": "A New Zealand woman has died on the Caribbean territory of Sint Maarten after the blast from a powerful jet engine knocked her to the ground. The incident happened at the famous Princess Juliana International Airport, which is just metres from the beach. Beachgoers can walk up to the airport fence as planes take off. Police said the 57-year-old woman had been holding on to the fence before the force of the jet engines threw her backwards, causing serious injury. She was taken to hospital for treatment, but died later. The particular stretch of beach on the Dutch territory is popular with tourists, partly because the planes fly extremely low over the sand before landing. The beginning of the runway is just 50m (160ft) from the fence on Maho beach, and about the same distance to the waterline. What is a jet engine air blast like?  There are prominent warning signs in the area instructing beachgoers not to stand near the fence because of the dangerous air blasts. Despite the danger, a number of videos circulating online show tourists clinging to the fence to prevent being swept away - and in some cases, almost being lifted off the ground. The island's tourism director, Rolando Brison, told the New Zealand Herald he had spoken to the family of the dead woman. \"I met with the family of the deceased this evening and while they recognised that what they did was wrong, through the clearly visible danger signs, they regret that risk they took turned out in the worst possible way,\" he said. The newspaper also said the plane taking off was a Boeing 737, a commercial jet. A number of local media reports said the woman struck her head on concrete when she was blown back from the fence line. In a statement, Sint Maarten police said they visit the area daily to discourage tourists from clinging to the runway fence. \"The landing and taking off of all types and size of aircraft at the international airport of Sint Maarten is well known worldwide as major tourist attraction,\" police said. \"Many tourists come to the island to experience the thrills of the landing of approaching aircraft flying low above their heads and the holding on to the airport fence and standing in the jet blast of large aircraft taking off. Doing this is, however, extremely dangerous.\"",

            "text": "The price of shares in suppliers to Boeing tumbled on Tuesday after the planemaker revealed it would pause production of its 737 Max aircraft. Shares in Senior, which counts Boeing as one of its biggest customers, fell by as much as much as 9%. Meanwhile, shares in Meggitt and Melrose dropped by more than 1%. On Monday night, Boeing confirmed it would halt production of the plane, which was grounded after two crashes that killed 346 people. Around 400 of the 737 Max jets have been delivered to airlines around the world since the first one rolled off the production line in 2017. But Boeing had orders for more than 4,000 of the planes, which cannot be delivered because of the global grounding. Boeing employs more than 2,500 people across 65 sites in the UK. Just last year, the planemaker opened a \u00a340m factory employing 75 people making parts for planes including the 737 Max. Boeing has said it will temporarily assign other roles to its own employees who are affected by the shutdown in production of the 737 Max. But that may not be as easy for Boeing's direct suppliers who employ 21,000 people in the UK, where the planemaker spent \u00a37.6bn between 2015 and 2018. One of those suppliers is Aeromet International, which makes parts for planes including the 737 Max. The firm's chief executive, Howard Kimberley, told the BBC that the firm has had \"ample time\" to slow down production after the 737 Max was grounded by regulators. \"We're in a wait-and-see mode at the moment,\" he said. But he said Aeromet's workforce had not been impacted by the slow down in production and he expected that other firms would redeploy workers into other areas of their businesses. \"Whilst we're clearly waiting for further news and updates from the Boeing Company I think in the short term I don't expect there to be any significant change in manning and the supply chain.\" Peter Bruch, a director of the Midlands Aerospace Alliance, which represents the region where a lot of plane parts are made, said Boeing's decision would send a \"shock wave\" through the UK aerospace sector. He said the decision to suspend production of the plane in January would see demand for parts fall to nothing with very little notice for suppliers. That will have a \"very dramatic\" impact on cash flow for those firms he said and he noted that it could lead to job losses. However, he said workers who had been laid off would not struggle to find other work in the sector, which is struggling with too much demand - rather than too little. In a statement, Senior said it \"continues to work closely with Boeing and its other customers\".",

            "text": "A Dutch court has found three men guilty of murder for shooting down a passenger jet over eastern Ukraine in 2014, killing 298 people. The court found that a Russian-made missile supplied from Russia and fired by an armed group under Russian control brought down flight MH17. The men - two Russians and one Ukrainian - were found guilty in absentia and sentenced to life in jail. A third Russian was acquitted. The missile attack was one of the most notorious war crimes in Ukraine before allegations of atrocities there became an almost daily reality.  Many of the victims' relatives believe if the world had reacted differently, and taken a tougher stance against Russia eight years ago, the invasion of Ukraine and the geopolitical instability that has followed could have been avoided. The judges ruled that it was a deliberate action to bring down a plane, even though the three found guilty had intended to shoot down a military not a civilian aircraft. Oleg Pulatov was the only one of the four accused to have legal representation at the trial. The judges acquitted him, although they found he knew about the missile. On 17 July 2014, 298 people, including 80 children and 15 crew, boarded Malaysia Airlines flight 17 to Kuala Lumpur at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport. The plane was cruising at 33,000 feet over Ukraine. It was the early days of Russia's efforts to control parts of the country.  At the time this was a relatively low-level conflict zone, but fighting had recently expanded into the air. In the preceding months a number of military planes had been shot down.  In response, Ukraine closed the airspace at lower altitudes - up to 32,000 feet. But planes were still crossing the country. The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was flying 1,000 feet above this restricted airspace. At 13:20 GMT, it lost contact with air traffic control. Of the 298 on board from 17 countries, 196 were from the Netherlands, 43 from Malaysia, 38 from Australia and 10 from the UK. They had packed for dream holidays, an Aids conference, family reunions and more. In a flash, all plans for the future were obliterated. \"I still miss them,\" says Silene Fredriksz, her walls adorned with snapshots of son Bryce and his girlfriend Daisy. The young couple were heading to Bali, a treat after a difficult year. Forward to 2022 and Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February opened up barely healed wounds. \"It was heartbreaking for us,\" Silene says. She is convinced the current conflict could have been avoided had the world taken a harder line in 2014.  \"Putin has never been stopped, and still has not been stopped. And he will not stop until he is stopped,\" Silene said. I hope the world wakes up now, because we knew it already eight years ago.\" Russia has always denied any involvement and instead pumped out a range of alternative theories - suggesting a Ukrainian fighter jet fired the missile, or that Ukrainian government forces were responsible, and in some cases fabricated evidence to support their claims.  These have in turn been diligently debunked with material gathered by a team of international investigators, and they were rejected by the Dutch court. The team found the disintegration of the plane in mid-air was caused by the detonation of a Russian-made 9N314M-type warhead carried on the 9M38M1 missile, launched from the eastern part of Ukraine using a Buk missile system.  Eliot Higgins, founder of the investigative platform Bellingcat, delved into the open source evidence. His team identified links with Russia's 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile Brigade, and trawled through 200 soldiers' social media posts to confirm the identity and role of many members of the unit based at a Russian military barracks in Kursk. Bellingcat shared their findings with Dutch prosecutors. He believes the trial has laid bare indisputable proof of Russia's involvement. \"I think at this point, and especially with a guilty verdict,\" Eliot told us, \"anyone who would claim that Russia wasn't involved with this shoot down is really a ridiculous person\". Based on his findings, Eliot Higgins believes the events of 2014 and 2022 are inextricably linked.   \"People were just turning a blind eye to it, policymakers just weren't comfortable with calling out Russia in a way they really should have done. And they didn't react in the way that could have prevented the invasion in 2022. I think there should have been more military support for Ukraine, there should have been more sanctions, there should have been a stronger response than we saw at the time. There could have been preventative measures that would have saved a lot of lives.\" The trial has been an opportunity to cut through Russian disinformation. The judges rejected an alternative version of events promoted by Buk missile maker Almaz-Antey as falsified and not independently assessed. \"There was the disaster itself. But the next disaster, I would say, was that Russia never cooperated. And that gave extra pain for all of us. And why was that necessary? Just say sorry,\" Hans de Borst tells us, as he shows us holiday photos of his 17-year-old daughter Elsemiek. He holds tight to the memories, as well as Elsemiek's passport and boarding pass, recovered intact from the wreckage. Families at the epicentre of the MH17 disaster invested their faith in the investigation led by the Netherlands. \"It is extremely important to me,\" he says stoically, \"because it's that feeling of justice needing to be done in a world that kills people who just go on holiday. If justice is not being done then your whole feeling of a good world doesn't exist anymore. So getting justice brought to you by so many people gives a good feeling and I hope, will give some peace about this subject.\" Piecing together clues including intercepted telephone calls, eyewitness accounts and even metal fragments found in the bodies of the crew, investigators were able to establish the type of weapon, track its route - from a military barracks in Russia, across the border to the launch site in pro-Russian separatist controlled eastern Ukraine - and identify key suspects. They are three Russians and one Ukrainian. The most prominent of them is Igor Girkin, who prosecutors say is a former colonel in Russia's intelligence service the FSB. The Kremlin has dismissed the legal proceedings and all suspects refused to appear in court. Only one, Oleg Pulatov, employed a team of Dutch lawyers to defend him in court. The judgment is unlikely to result in anyone serving time in jail for this mass murder, but the investigation has created an incontestable historical record and delivered the families some peace of mind. \"We will never get our children back,\" Silene Fredriksz accepts, \"but\u2026 we need the truth. And we need justice. This is a small part of our justice.\" MH17: The Search for Truth Hear more from the families' on their quest for justice. Available on iPlayer from 8pm GMT (UK only).",

            "text": "A former senior manager at Boeing's 737 plant in Seattle has raised new concerns over the safety of the company's 737 Max. The aircraft, which was grounded after two accidents in which 346 people died, has already been cleared to resume flights in North America and Brazil, and is expected to gain approval in Europe this week.  But in a new report, Ed Pierson claims that further investigation of electrical issues and production quality problems at the 737 factory is badly needed. Regulators in the US and Europe insist their reviews have been thorough, and that the 737 Max aircraft is now safe. In his report, Mr Pierson claims that regulators and investigators have largely ignored factors, which he believes, may have played a direct role in the accidents.  He explicitly links them to conditions at the company's factory in Renton, near Seattle at the time. Boeing says this is unfounded. Lion Air flight JT610 crashed into the sea off Indonesia in October 2018. Five months later, Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 came down minutes after take-off from the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. Investigators believe both accidents were triggered by the failure of a single sensor. It sent inaccurate data to a piece of flight control software, called MCAS.  This automated system then repeatedly forced the nose of the aircraft downwards, when the pilots were trying to gain height. Ultimately each aircraft was pushed into an unrecoverable dive. Efforts to make the 737 Max safe have focused on redesigning the MCAS software, and ensuring it can no longer be triggered by a single sensor failure. For Ed Pierson, this does not go nearly far enough. A US Navy veteran, who had a senior role on the 737 production line from 2015-2018, he was a star witness during congressional hearings into the disasters involving the Max. He told lawmakers he had become so concerned about conditions at the factory, he had told his bosses that he was hesitant about taking his own family on a Boeing plane. He testified that during 2018, the factory was in a \"chaotic\" and \"dysfunctional\" state as, he claimed, staff there struggled under pressure from managers to build new planes as quickly as possible. Now, he is worried that these issues have been overlooked in the rush to get the 737 Max back in the air. His report draws on material from the official investigations. It claims that both of the crashed aircraft suffered from - what he believes were - production defects, almost from the moment they entered service.  These included intermittent flight control system problems and electrical anomalies that occurred in the days and weeks before the accidents.  He claims these may have been symptoms of flaws in the aircrafts' highly complex wiring systems, which could have contributed to the erroneous deployment of MCAS. He also points out that sensor failures contributed to both accidents and asks why such failures were happening on brand new machines. In the case of the Lion Air plane, a faulty sensor was replaced with another part that was not properly calibrated. All signs, Mr Pierson says, \"point back to where these airplanes were produced, the 737 factory\".  However, he insists that the possibility of production defects playing a role in the accidents has not been addressed by regulators. He claims this could lead to further tragedies, involving the Max or even a previous version of the 737. Mr Pierson's concerns are supported by the celebrated aviation safety campaigner Captain Chesley Sullenberger.   Best known as \"Sully\", one of the pilots who safely ditched a crippled and engineless Airbus plane in the Hudson river off Manhattan in 2009, he too believes that modifications to the Max do not go far enough.  He believes changes are needed to warning systems aboard the plane, which were carried over from a previous version of the 737 and are \"not up to modern standards\". \"Ed Pierson's report is very disturbing, about manufacturing issues in the Boeing factories that go well beyond just the Max, and also affect\u2026 the previous version of the 737,\" says Capt Sullenberger. \"There are many critically important unanswered questions that must be answered.  \"Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) must finally become more transparent, and begin to provide information and data, so that independent experts can determine the worthiness of the work that's been done.\" The BBC has also spoken to a former senior inspector with the UK's Air Accident Investigations Branch (AAIB), who now works as a safety specialist. He warns that Mr Pierson's findings should be viewed in a wider context.  The report, he says, does make some \"valid observations\" about the pressures on Boeing's production line and quality control, and concerns about specific components.  However, he adds that \"taking the limited information in any accident report\u2026 and making fresh interpretations of it, is not the same as conducting a new investigation\".  The issues highlighted, he adds, \"may have been investigated and dismissed already, for good reason\".  The FAA, meanwhile, insists it only approved the return to service of the Max, following a \"comprehensive and methodical safety review process\".  It adds: \"None of the many investigations of the two accidents produced evidence that a production flaw played a role\", and emphasises that \"every aircraft leaving the factory is inspected by a team of FAA inspectors before it is cleared for delivery\". Boeing itself will not comment on whether the electrical and flight control problems highlighted by Mr Pierson may have played a factor in the two accidents, on the grounds that this is a matter for the investigating authorities. It has, however, described suggestions of any link between conditions at Renton and the two accidents as \"completely unfounded\", emphasising that none of the authorities investigating the crashes has found any such link.  Patrick Ky, the head of Europe's aviation safety agency, EASA, has previously told the BBC he is \"certain\" the plane is safe to fly. But relatives of those who died aboard ET302 are continuing to urge the agency not to allow the 737 Max to operate in Europe, \"until continuing concerns about the aircraft's safety have been fully and openly addressed\".",

            "title": "Canada election: First week begins with a crash",
            "text": "Candidates have been on the campaign trail for a week and all the federal leaders have kicked off their campaigns with appeals to people's pocketbooks, announcing policies related to housing, childcare, household savings, parental benefits, and taxes.  Cost of living and affordability are top issues for Canadian voters this campaign.  But other topics have also emerged as dominant issues, including the contentious secularism bill passed by Quebec earlier this year.  It was one of the first questions launched at Liberal leader Justin Trudeau this week, and subsequently all other leaders have had to come up with their response: What should be done about Bill 21? The controversial legislation, which was passed by the province of Quebec in June, bars civil servants in positions of \"authority\" from wearing religious symbols at work like judges, police officers, teachers and other public figures. Critics say it is discriminatory, will make it more difficult for religious minorities to integrate into Quebec society, and that it unfairly targets Muslim women. But many Quebecers support the controversial law, which puts all political leaders in a sticky spot, since the province - with 78 of the 338 seats in the House of Commons - will be a crucial battleground this election. To varying degrees, all the federal leaders have spoken out against the legislation though the Bloc Quebecois, a federal sovereignist party that only runs candidates in Quebec, support the bill.  NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, a practising Sikh who wears a turban, has called his own presence in Quebec an \"act of defiance\" against the bill.  But despite critical words, party leaders say they will let court battles launched in Quebec against the bill play out - keeping their hands out of Quebec's affairs.  Mr Trudeau has gone the furthest in his statements on Bill 21, saying last week he wouldn't \"close the door on intervening\" down the road.  Why hesitate? If Mr Trudeau takes too strong a stance against the law, he could alienate some Quebec voters.  The election got off the a flying start even if Mr Trudeau's plane was grounded by a scraped wing on the first day of the campaign. It was not unprecedented in Canadian election history - something similar happened to Mr Trudeau's father, former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, 39 years ago. Liberal leader Justin Trudeau did not attend the first leaders debate of the election, hosted by Maclean's / CityTV last Thursday,. His absence was marked by an empty podium. With the Green party nipping at the heels of the New Democrats (NDP) in the polls, there is a clear rivalry emerging between the two left-leaning parties.  The latest in their tit-for-tat saga is that the NDP has recruited \u00c9ric Ferland, a former a former head of the Green Party in Quebec, to run against Pierre Nantel, who quit the NDP to join the Greens in August. Shortly after he quit, the provincial Green Party leader of New Brunswick said 14 NDP provincial candidates were switching to the Green Party because they were unhappy with Mr Singh's federal leadership. Many who were initially named as part of the exodus said the claim was not true, which led federal Green Party leader Elizabeth May to accuse the federal NDP of using \"strong-arm tactics\" to get those candidates back in the fold. MP Maxime Bernier made quite the splash when he quit the Conservative Party to form the right-wing People's Party of Canda last year.  Now, the Rhinoceros Party, a fringe satirical - but real - federal party plans to field a candidate to run against him named... Maxime Bernier. The Rhinoceros Party's Mr Bernier says he would make a vasectomy mandatory for men over the age of 16 so that \"Canada will be a world leader in the fight against climate change\".  Reuters noted in their piece on the candidate that PPC's Bernier does not believe in climate change.",

            "text": "The Dutch government says it is taking Russia to the European Court of Human Rights for its \"role in the downing\" of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in 2014.  Foreign Minister Stef Blok says the \"highest priority\" is justice for the 298 victims on board the plane shot down over eastern Ukraine. It happened after Russian-backed rebels seized the area. Dutch-led investigators say they have proof the Buk missile system that shot down the plane was brought from Russia. Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in the attack. Citizens of 10 different countries died on board the Boeing 777 airliner that was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. More than two-thirds of the victims were Dutch nationals.  In March, a trial opened in the Netherlands of three Russian and one Ukrainian citizens - still at large - for the murder of 298 people on board the plane. They are all linked to the pro-Moscow separatists.  The trial, in a court near Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, is expected to last for months. In a statement, the Dutch foreign ministry said the government \"decided to bring Russia before the European Court of Human Rights for its role in the downing of Flight MH17\". It said that \"by taking this course of action the government is offering maximum support\" to individual cases already brought against Russia by victims' families. \"Achieving justice for 298 victims of the downing of Flight MH17 is and will remain the government's highest priority,\" said Mr Blok.  \"By taking this step today... we are moving closer to this goal,\" he added. At the same time, the Dutch foreign ministry stressed on the \"importance to continuing the meetings with Russia on the matter of state responsibility\". Russia has so far made no official comments on the latest Dutch move. Although Moscow argues it has long offered to co-operate with the Dutch-led investigators, it has also presented several versions of what brought down MH17. Dutch officials asked Russia to submit any information they had, but said at one point that the information it had provided was \"factually inaccurate on several points\". Late last year, Russia was asked by Dutch prosecutors to arrest a Ukrainian suspect alleged to have run rebel air defences close to the missile firing site. Instead, according to prosecutors, Russia deliberately allowed him to travel to eastern Ukraine. The Dutch and Australian governments made clear in 2018 they held Russia responsible for the deployment of the Buk missile launcher that brought down the plane.",

            "text": "Provisional figures from The Met Office show that London Heathrow has reached a temperature of 40.2C. If confirmed, it would be the first time the UK has recorded a temperature of over 40 degrees. To get a standardised temperature, scientists use a weather station, known as a Stevenson Screen.  These white boxes, which contain a thermometer, are installed 4ft (1.25m) above the ground and are dotted all around the UK. The weather station at Heathrow is located very close to the northern runway, so do the aeroplanes constantly landing and taking off affect the temperatures recorded? Not according to Paul Williams, Professor of Atmospheric Science at the University of Reading. \"Planes make a negligible difference,\" says Professor Williams. \"Every time you use energy - whether it's from a plane's engine, or even just switching on a light bulb or taking a shower - it's eventually turned into heat.  \"But all of that is a minor influence compared to the effect of the urban heat island.\" The urban heat island is, Prof Williams explains, the process where buildings absorb more sunlight than open fields. Cities tend to hang on to the heat for longer, which can push up temperatures by a few degrees, he says. Heathrow - with its large black asphalt runways and airport buildings - naturally absorbs more heat. The airport is based in London, which is also very built-up, and so the urban heat island also affects surrounding areas. If you compare Heathrow to nearby Kew - which is eight miles away - there is hardly any temperature difference between the two. Both areas are hotter, on average, than the rest of the UK. This suggests the urban heat island contributes to higher average temperatures. But what about carbon dioxide (CO2) gas levels expelled by the planes? Prof Williams says CO2 is a greenhouse gas and does trap heat but, because it mixes very quickly with the air, it warms the entire climate, not just Heathrow. \"If you measure the CO2 levels above Heathrow they wouldn't be any higher than other parts of the UK because it spreads so quickly,\" he says. The Met Office told the BBC that its weather stations are built to very specific standards and any biases that could affect temperature records are taken into account when analysing readings. It also pointed out that Heathrow is many miles from the sea, which means it doesn't benefit from a cooling effect that many coastal areas receive. When you look at overall records, it says there is a pattern between high temperatures and the distance from the sea. Even the soil can be a factor, according to Gareth Harvey from the BBC Weather Centre. \"Take another very warm spot, like Wisley - located in the Surrey heathland and typified by sandy soils,\" he says. \"Sand is a natural insulator and so the heating effect of sunshine is stored in the top layer only, which gets very hot and then warms the air.\"  In summary, the overall temperature of any particular weather station is likely to be affected by several factors - including: the amount of tarmac, the number of buildings, distance from the sea and even the type of soil. So, there's more to Heathrow's hot spot than its proximity to roaring jet engines.",

            "text": "After being grounded in May, the last B-17 aircraft in Europe will fly again. The bomber most famously used in World War Two was prevented from flying after a safety issue was discovered with a wing. Based at Duxford in Cambridgeshire, the B-17, named Sally B, bought as a restoration project by Ted White. \"I was absolutely delighted, I could have cried,\" said the plane's operator Elly Sallingboe after it was granted approval to fly again. The B-17 was used on bombing raids over Germany during the 1939-45 conflict - with many US air bases set up across Britain, particularly in East Anglia and Lincolnshire. Along with the Sally B at Imperial War Museum (IWM) Duxford, only three other airworthy B-17s still exist and they are in the US.  After the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) found a safety fault in the wings of the American-based planes, the IWM took the decision to ground the Sally B and have it inspected by the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The team behind the plane announced they had been working \"flat out\" to carry out the difficult task. Mark Lawler from Kearsley Airways carried out the inspection - it is his job to find the faults. He said: \"You've got to bear in mind this has been flying for many, many years and there may be cracks that are hidden that you can't see.\" Steve Carter, deputy chief engineer for the B-17, said it grounding had been \"terrible timing\" as they were getting the plane ready for the busy summer months.  He said: \"We were on the cusp of ready to go flying, so we got the aeroplane ready, got her outside, ran her up and literally the week before we were supposed to go flying the AD [Airworthiness Directive] was issued.\"  According to the Sally B website, the plane was named after Elly Sallingboe \"in the bold and colourful tradition of American-style wartime nose art\". Mr White was killed in a T-6 plane crash in Malta in 1982. While tests were being carried out, Ms Sallingboe said: \"We are all very nervous in anticipation of what he's going to say, because either it is grounded for two years or it flies in a few weeks.\" Luckily, no cracks were found during the inspection and it was confirmed that the B-17, also known by the nickname Flying Fortress, could return to service. \"Our aircraft is in an outstanding condition for her age,\" said Ms Sallingboe. Ms Sallingboe added: \"I was absolutely delighted when we received the news; I could have cried and actually did. \"It has been an incredibly hard time for us as we not only had to fix the aircraft, but we also lost a third of our booked air shows by having it grounded. \"We cannot carry passengers on the B-17, so our only income comes from air shows and donations from the public.\" After test flying and crew training on Friday, Sally B was due to make a public appearance at the Duxford Summer Air Show on Saturday, 24 and Sunday, 25 June.  The team is also in the process of raising funds to cover the cost of repair work.  Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Got a story?

Audrey Harris, from Malvern in Worcestershire, took on the daring feat in aid of the Fitzroy charity, which cared for her daughter Angie.  So far she has raised almost \u00a33,000 through the challenge, achieved with the help of AeroSuperBatics Wingwalkers in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. She said the walk was \"so exciting\".  Angie, who was disabled, died earlier this year from Covid-19 and had been supported during her life by Fitzroy, which provides support services for adults with learning disabilities, autism and complex mental health support needs. \"I wanted to pay them back for 30 years of looking after her in a way that was wonderful,\" Mrs Harris said.   Of her efforts, David Barrell, lead formation wing-walking pilot, said: \"I think it is fantastic. It demonstrates that people of that age can do these sorts of things. It is a tremendous experience anyway.\"  Mrs Harris flew on top of a 1943 Boeing Steerman, and was in the air for 10 minutes, reaching heights of 700ft and speeds of 100mph. Mrs Harris's other daughter, Tania Charles, said: \"I'm so proud of her. \"She's just been fantastic and very brave and done it in memory of my sister Angie.\" Asked whether she would do another wing walk, Mrs Harris said: \"Not tomorrow, but someday maybe - and maybe loop-de-loop, you never know.\"  Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

            "title": "Paris Airshow: Difficult decisions for Boeing lie ahead",
            "text": "Boeing is coming to this year's Paris Airshow, which starts on Monday, facing some difficult decisions in the wake of the two deadly Boeing 737 Max crashes, while its global rival Airbus is widely expected to unveil a long-range version of its best-selling A321 - potentially taking away some of Boeing's customers.  With almost 2,500 companies exhibiting and 320,000 visitors expected over seven days, the show at Le Bourget on the outskirts of Paris is one of the aerospace and defence industry's key trade fairs for a sector that generates global revenues of some $685bn annually. Expect most of the press attention to be focussed on Boeing's CEO Dennis Muilenburg, and how the firm is working with aviation regulators to get its troubled 737 Max aircraft back in the air. Piling on the pressure facing Boeing executives, just this week a US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) official indicated that airlines' fleets of Boeing 737 Max aircraft might be grounded until the end of the year - longer than many had been expecting. \"The highest priority for us is the 737 Max's safe return to service,\" said Mr Muilenburg recently.  Indeed, it has been a key seller for the US firm, which has roughly 4,500 unfulfilled orders for the aircraft.  For Airbus - under new CEO Guillaume Faury - it is the first airshow at Le Bourget since it made the decision to end production of its flagship A380. But the much-heralded unveiling of its A321XLR, is likely to garner positive headlines.  This is a single-aisle long-range airliner which Airbus hopes will generate new orders. Several carriers have already reportedly expressed an interest, including IAG - the parent group of British Airways and Iberia.  For Airbus this is possibly a strategy to counter Boeing's eventual NMA (New Midsize Aircraft) that the US firm has been working on. The twin-aisled NMA, also labelled the 797, has been designed in two variants: a 225-seat plane with a 9,300km (5,700 mile) range and a 275-seater flying 8,300km. However, unlike Airbus's A321XLR this would be a totally new aircraft - so it would take a lot longer to see the light of day.  Away from the marketing battle between Airbus and Boeing, there will be more focus on unmanned aircraft, lighter and stronger alloys and composite materials - but the most significant developments may well be developments in hybrid and all-electric aircraft engines.  US firm magniX is showing off two of its electric motors at the show. It is working with North America's largest seaplane operator to retrofit the entire fleet with electric engines and magniX motors will also power the new all-electric Alice, a small passenger aircraft from Israeli firm Eviation.  MagniX says it wants to transform the \"middle mile\" segment of the market - that's cargo and passenger flights up to 1,000 miles (1,600km). \"As we debut our propulsion system at the Paris Airshow, we're one step closer to all-electric air transport starting in 2022,\" says magniX chief executive Roei Ganzarski. All makers are keenly aware of the need to reduce CO2 emissions - commercial flights account for 2.5% of global greenhouse gasses.  But as air passenger numbers double - even with battery-powered aircraft, alternative fuels and lighter materials, the goal of reducing overall CO2 emissions in the aviation sector remains as challenging as ever.  More from the BBC on aerospace and defence: The sector has also seen significant business changes recently. Canadian-based manufacturer Bombardier has quit the commercial airliner business.  Airbus has taken over its C-Series regional jets, Bombardier has put its Northern Ireland factories up for sale and is talking about the sale of its remaining regional jets  business to Japan's Mitsubishi. Meanwhile, two of the US's major defence giants, United Technologies Corp (UTC) and Raytheon, have proposed a $121bn (\u00a396bn) deal - combining the makers of missiles, electronic warfare systems, and engines for Airbus and the F-35 fighter jet. When it comes to defence, notable newcomers include Boeing's KC-46 tanker and a PAC JF-17 fighter jet, a joint development between Pakistan and China. Japan is putting its military capabilities on show with its Kawasaki P-1 maritime patrol aircraft. Yet much interest will centre on fighters, as European nations work out their visions for a next-generation combat plane. The big question is whether Europe can unite around a single design or whether countries will end up developing different sixth-generation fighter aircraft.  But as it took about 10 years of negotiating and talking in the 1970s, which led to requirements for fighters being firmed up in the 1980s - finally leading to Eurofighter Typhoon, Sweden's Gripen and France's Rafale in the 1990s - this year's show is unlikely to give us any quick answers.",

            "title": "'Flight shame' could halve growth in air traffic",
            "text": "Travellers are beginning to turn their backs on air travel over concern for the environment, according to a survey by Swiss bank UBS. The Swedish concept of \"flygskam\" or \"flight shame\" appears to be spreading. One in five of the people surveyed had cut the number of flights they took over the last year because of the impact on the climate. UBS said the expected growth in passenger numbers could be halved if these trends were borne out. Global air travel has grown by between 4% and 5% a year, UBS said, meaning the overall numbers are doubling every 15 years.  Industry forecasts from plane makers Airbus and Boeing predict growth will continue at that rate until 2035.  But the UBS survey suggests that high-profile campaigns - like the example set by Swedish school girl Greta Thunberg, which has helped push the climate crisis up the political agenda - could trigger a change in flying habits in wealthier parts of the world, particularly in the US and Europe. After surveying more than 6,000 people in the US, Germany, France and the UK, UBS found that 21% had reduced the number of flights they took over the last year. Nathan Molyneaux, from Leeds, moved to Aarhus in Denmark for work, and since then the number of flights he has taken have increased. \"I moved out here two and a half years ago and flights have ballooned a bit as I have friends in the UK,\" says the 38-year-old senior sales planner. \"I am flying a lot more than usual and I need to reduce that for the good of the environment - the challenge is to try and not fly at all.\" As an extreme example of his new regime, the keen runner plans an overland trip from his home on Denmark's east coast to Barcelona for a half-marathon next February. \"I will take a train from Aarhus to Cologne in Germany, and spend the night there.  I will then take two TGV high-speed trains through France and Spain,\" he says. \"It will be a long journey but that is part of the fun - about 24 hours of travel but I should get to see some beautiful countryside.\" He estimates that moving from aircraft to trains as his main mode of travel will be about 20% more expensive, but says his trip to Catalonia will only cost \u20ac40 (\u00a336) more. Mr Molyneaux says there has been a lack of investment in Danish railways in recent years, but that appears to now be changing. He is also disappointed about the reduction in ferry services between the north of England and mainland Europe, with a number of routes axed in recent years. Only 16% of British respondents said they were cutting back on flying, but 24% of US travellers were worried enough to change their flying habits. The survey was first conducted in May this year and UBS said there had been a marked change since then.  The bank now expects the number of flights in the EU will increase by just 1.5% per year, which is half the rate expected by plane maker Airbus. The bank forecasted that growth in US flights would fall from the 2.1% expected to just 1.3%. And that could have a big impact on aircraft manufacturers.  UBS estimates it could reduce the number of smaller planes ordered from Airbus and rival Boeing by 110 each year. The bank said that would reduce revenues at Airbus, which controls around 57% of the market, by around \u20ac2.8bn (\u00a32.5bn) a year. Are you planning to fly less to help combat climate change?

            "text": "British Airways' owner IAG is expanding its low-cost long-haul airline Level further by launching short-haul routes from a base in Austria. The move puts it further in competition with rivals EasyJet and Ryanair. IAG launched the Level brand more than a year ago as a low-cost rival to challenger Norwegian. The new Level service from Vienna will start on 17 July, with four planes serving 14 destinations including Gatwick and Barcelona. IAG has been moving further away from the traditional airline model of its BA and Iberia brands. Recently it tried, but failed, to buy low-cost long-haul airline Norwegian Air Shuttle. It also tried to buy Vienna-based Niki, the creation of former racing champion Niki Lauda, but lost out to Ryanair.  Vienna airport has attracted expansion from other low-cost services recently, including EasyJet, Lufthansa's low-cost arm Eurowings and Hungary's Wizz Air. The travel editor of the Independent, Simon Calder, said IAG's decision was a bold move that would mean a \"massive fares war\". \"British Airways' parent company has astonished the aviation market by launching a new Vienna-based subsidiary with less than three weeks' notice,\" he said. Level started in Barcelona last March to compete with other long-haul budget airlines, such as Norwegian Air Shuttle and Wow Air. It expanded that business by basing two planes at Paris Orly airport and launching new routes. Another development saw it buy landing extra slots at Gatwick airport from the now-defunct Monarch airlines, slots analysts said could be used to expand  its Level operations. Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, said: \"We are launching this new short-haul subsidiary to provide Austrian consumers with more flight choices across Europe. These flights will be branded as Level to build upon the huge success of our new long-haul low-cost operation.\"",

            "title": "EU proposes tariffs on \u00a315bn of US products in Boeing row",
            "text": "The EU has proposed tariffs on $20bn (\u00a315bn) of US goods in a long-running dispute over Boeing aircraft subsidies. The proposal comes after the WTO said earlier this month that the US had failed to remove some Boeing subsidies. The EU move comes after the US said it was considering tariffs on about $11bn (\u00a38.4bn) worth of EU goods in response to Airbus subsidies.  And it comes after the EU approved plans in April for trade talks with the US designed to reduce trade barriers. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m said: \"European companies must be able to compete on fair and equal terms. \"The recent WTO ruling on US subsidies for Boeing is important in this respect. We must continue to defend a level-playing field for our industry.\" The proposed tariffs cover a range of products from aircraft to chemicals and food products including frozen fish, citrus fruit, and ketchup. Analysis: BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker The EU's threat to impose new tariffs on US goods doesn't exactly lighten the mood in a situation where global trade tensions have already intensified. But this proposal - like the corresponding US plan for action against the EU over subsidies to Airbus - is consistent with the established rules of the World Trade Organization. Both sides have published lists of goods for consultation and both say they will wait for a WTO arbitrator to tell them how much action they should take. It's an important difference from the dispute between China and US, and American action over steel and aluminium, where it can be argued that countries have gone beyond what the WTO rules permit. Those actions led to genuine concerns that the rules-based system for managing global trade may be facing serious threats. But the proposed retaliation on aviation does not. The US and the EU have been battling for almost 15 years at the World Trade Organization over subsidies given to US planemaker Boeing and its European rival Airbus. After partial victories for both sides, each is asking a WTO arbitrator to determine the level of countermeasures they can impose on the other. The Trump administration last week proposed targeting a seven-page list of EU products for tariffs, ranging from large aircraft to dairy products and wine, to counteract the harm from EU subsidies for Airbus that are worth an estimated $11bn. The EU has responded with its own 11-page list of US imports, including agricultural produce and dried fruit, to planes, tobacco, handbags, suitcases, tractors, helicopters and video game consoles. The published list will now be open to consultation until 31 May and could then be revised. \"The EU remains open for discussions with the US, provided these are without preconditions and aim at a fair outcome,\" Ms Malmstr\u00f6m said. In both cases, WTO arbitrators have yet to set an amount, but the US case against Airbus is more advanced, with a ruling possible in June or July. The EU case against Boeing could come early in 2020. Both sides have said they would prefer a settlement that did not lead to tariffs being imposed. Meanwhile, the EU has said it is ready to start formal trade talks with the US. The Commission is set to start two sets of negotiations - one to cut tariffs on industrial goods, the other to make it easier for companies to show products meet EU or US standards. But the EU has insisted that agriculture will not be included, putting it at odds with the US, which wants farm products to be part of the talks.",

            "text": "Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says it has been given a jet worth around $500m (\u00a3380m) by Qatar's emir. Mr Erdogan said Sheikh Tamim Al Thani had donated the Boeing 747-8i to the Turkish state after hearing that it was interested in buying it. Opposition MPs had expressed concern that the president was using taxpayers' money to buy a jet as the country struggles to avert a financial crisis. Turkey has backed Qatar in a year-long stand-off with other Arab states. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain severed all diplomatic and trade links with the tiny gas-rich state over its close ties to Iran and its alleged support for jihadists - a charge it denies. Turkey sent food by sea and air to prevent shortages in Qatar's supermarkets after its only land border was closed and ships serving it were banned from many ports. The Boeing 747-8i was described by The Drive website as \"the largest and most expensive private jet in the world\" when it was put on sale last month. The aircraft was reportedly only delivered to Qatar in 2015, after being refitted to carry 76 passengers, rather than the usual 400. On board are staterooms, lounges, boardrooms, first class seating areas, and even a hospital. After the jet landed in Turkey last week, an opposition MP tabled a parliamentary question asking Vice-President Fuat Oktay to disclose whether it had been purchased by the state. Speaking to reporters flying with him from Azerbaijan to Turkey over the weekend, Mr Erdogan said Qatar's emir had given the plane as a gift after learning that the Turkish government had expressed an interest in it. \"He said: 'I won't take money from Turkey. I give this as a present to Turkey',\" the president quoted Sheikh Hamad as saying. Mr Erdogan told reporters the plane was being repainted, adding: \"God willing, we can have a trip with it when all is over.\" Last month, Qatar's emir approved a package of economic projects, investments and deposits worth $15bn (\u00a311.4bn) to support Turkey's economy and currency. The Turkish lira has lost almost 40% of its value against the dollar this year, driven by worries over Mr Erdogan's influence on monetary policy and a diplomatic row with the United States. ",

            "text": "The Canadian who captivated the planet with music videos and social media updates from space talks about his globetrotting travels on Earth. Chris Hadfield was already a veteran astronaut by the time he became a global internet phenomenon. He\u2019d flown a space shuttle to the Russian space station Mir in 1995 and had done his first stint aboard the International Space Station in 2001. But it was his time aboard the latter, from December 2012 to May 2013, that made the astronaut a full-fledged star. His photos of Earth and accompanying observations, which he posted to Twitter, Facebook and other social media sites, inspired legions of followers. Then the guitar-playing astronaut released a\u00a0captivating music video\u00a0in which he sang David Bowie\u2019s Space Oddity while floating\u00a0in zero gravity\u00a0\u2013 a performance viewed more than 25 million times. Hadfield has since retired from the Canadian Space Agency and is now teaching, writing and speaking about his experiences. We recently caught up with him to ask about his travels back on Earth. You\u2019ve seen such amazing views of Earth from space. Have aeroplane window seats lost their appeal? [Laughs.] I always prefer window seats, partly because I\u2019m intimately familiar with the whole world and it\u2019s lovely to see how it looks today. People always want to come up and talk to me, but being over by a window also gives me slightly more privacy. When did you get the travel bug? I was really lucky because my dad was an airline pilot, and in the 1960s and \u201870s the family travel privileges were much more permissive. So as kids, we travelled quite a bit, all around North America, down to the Caribbean; skiing in Switzerland and Austria. Travel became a normal adventure, and I think it set the bug for the rest of my life. Since then, I guess I\u2019ve been to 60 or 70 countries. And it\u2019s been contagious. All my kids have been to 60-plus countries, and my wife as well. For us, it\u2019s an important part of how to live right now: to see as much of the world as possible, draw your own conclusions and try to understand the world through your own particular filter. What kind of travelling do you do these days? I travel about five days a week, for a variety of reasons. I\u2019m a university professor in a different town than I live in, so I go back and forth. My first book,\u00a0An Astronaut\u2019s Guide to Life on Earth, is in 20 languages, so I\u2019ve done speaking tours across the US, Canada, the UK, Germany and Australia. And I\u2019ve done tours for the second book,\u00a0You Are Here. I\u2019m also on the Canadian Space Advisory Board, helping our government with space policy, so there\u2019s a lot of travel with that. And then my daughter is graduating with her PhD in Dublin this weekend so we\u2019ll be going over, and I have a son in China, so we travel quite a lot for family reasons. And that\u2019s not to mention the 2,600 orbits of the world that I did onboard space ships. My head is spinning. Yeah, it\u2019s busy. Any travel habits you\u2019ve developed to make the most of your time on the road? The key when travelling as much as I do is to not to treat travel as anything different. I seek to make it as non-interruptive as possible, so I can go from productive environment to productive environment as quickly and efficiently as possible. If I can just get a power source and wireless, it\u2019s as if I\u2019m back in my office.\u00a0 I have patterns for long [haul] travel. I\u2019ve crossed the Atlantic more times than most people, with a lot of trips from Houston to Russia and back in my 21 years as an astronaut. So I tend to pack late and pack light, and then eat light as well. I would rather show up at the other end hungry so I have the greatest chance to get my body onto the digestive cycle of the new place. Nobody at home would have a big dinner and wake up\u00a0at 1:30 am\u00a0and have another big dinner. It delays your sleep adaptation and your digestive adaptation, which are linked. And I try to stay triply hydrated, because planes are dehydrating. Has seeing Earth from space changed the way you view the planet when you travel? Yeah, I think it annoys my wife. When we\u2019re driving I know what\u2019s around the next corner, even though we\u2019ve never been there before. It\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re going to see this big cove up there, or the surf really pours in here\u201d. It is, actually, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. I\u2019ve already seen so much of the world, if not the whole thing, many times. It\u2019s as if you\u2019ve done your homework everywhere you go and you know the lay of the land and where the lakes are and where the nearest town is and how it\u2019s laid out. Travelling becomes a much richer experience. Did you see places from space that you made sure to visit when you returned to Earth \u2013 or are there places you still want to see? Oh, absolutely. The list is long. There are places that are alluring because they\u2019re beautiful: the South Sea islands, Bora Bora, Fiji and all along the Great Barrier Reef. All of the islands in that part of the world. I haven\u2019t seen most of them yet and would love to. I have not seen New Zealand on the ground, but to see it from space \u2013 the huge volcano on the southern tip of the North Island, and the richness of the fjords and nature in the south, and the wine country at the north end of the South Island \u2013 just kind of coalescing every time I went by. That was really interesting to look at. I haven\u2019t been to the Channel Islands [off the southern California coast] or the Isle of Man [off the coast of England], either. There\u2019s a distinct feel to islands. They develop their own flora, fauna and personality. And in Africa, I\u2019ve only been to Egypt and South Africa. The continent is so vast \u2013 from 30 north to 30 south \u2013 I\u2019ve seen it all but I\u2019ve never been there on the ground.\u00a0 Has your time in space affected your sense of wanderlust? It\u2019s not so much my wanderlust that\u2019s changed, it\u2019s more a respect for the absolute commonality of the human experience. Yes, there\u2019s a strong local influence \u2013 our own history and culture and sets of laws \u2013 but when you go around the world every 92 minutes, the sameness overwhelms the differences. The repeated pattern of human habitation. How we set up cities. How that pattern looks whether it\u2019s a city in Alberta or Africa or Australia. You\u2019re passing over Canada and in 20 minutes you\u2019re over Africa. You see the commonalities much more strongly than you see the differences. I think that is actually the reality of the world \u2013 the shared common nature of our experience. We tend to exaggerate our differences and become extremely used to our own set of biases. But travel teaches you the shared nature of being human. And it\u2019s extremely important, because so much of our bad decision-making \u2013 at personal, business, national and planetary levels \u2013 is driven by myopia and a lack of understanding of anything beyond our normal confines. The more people can see of the world, the better their decision-making will be. It appears that more people will be seeing the world from space. What are your thoughts on developments in space tourism? Is this a good thing? Oh it\u2019s a good thing. Air travel was impossible 100 years ago. You could maybe get a ride in an aeroplane but your odds of death were very high. Now, air travel is so commonplace that after a 12-hour flight, the only thing you\u2019re likely to tell somebody is what you ate or what movie you watched. We\u2019re in the infancy of space travel. We just haven\u2019t come up with all the necessary inventions yet. But what\u00a0Richard Branson is doing, what\u00a0Elon Musk is doing, what\u00a0Jeff Bezos is doing, what\u00a0Boeing is doing\u00a0\u2013 these are the early foundations. None of them has it right. But we\u2019ll get there eventually. I\u2019m just pleased to have been one of the early enablers, one of the people who got to see it early on with my own eyes and then to have done my absolute best to try to share that experience with as many people as possible. Where do you rank in our tribe of worldly readers? Answer these questions to get a sense.",

            "title": "United Airlines bets on travel boom with big plane order",
            "text": "United Airlines has placed its biggest aircraft order to date in a bet on travel returning post-pandemic. The US airline confirmed it had ordered 270 Boeing and Airbus planes worth more than $30bn (\u00a321.6bn) on Tuesday. Its chief executive Scott Kirby said the purchases would \"accelerate our business to meet a resurgence in air travel\". The deal will see older, smaller jets replaced - mostly with Boeing 737 Max planes - between 2022 and 2026. The bigger planes will carry more passengers on domestic routes and enable the airline to sell more premium seats in first class or with extra legroom.  Like many other airlines, United Airlines struggled as demand for travel was constricted during coronavirus-related lockdowns. At the height of the crisis, it announced that it would need to furlough up to 36,000 staff. But Mr Kirby said Tuesday's move \"underscores the critical role United plays in fuelling the broader US economy\". He added: \"We expect the addition of these new aircraft will have a significant economic impact on the communities we serve in terms of job creation, traveller spending and the shipping of goods and services.\" In a separate update on Monday, it announced that it expected that July would be its first profitable month on a pre-tax basis since last January. It is, however, still expected to report a quarterly loss between April and June in its next update. United also plans to build up domestic hubs across airports in Chicago, Houston and Denver, as international and business travel returns at a slower pace. The US screened 2.02 million passengers on 11 June at airports - the highest number since March 2020, according to its Transportation Security Administration. But passengers who have been in the UK, Ireland, Brazil, China and Iran in the last 14 days cannot enter the US unless a specific exemption applies, as a presidential decree introduced last March is still in place. Richard Aboulafia, an aviation expert at Teal Group, said the deals made sense for the airline in the current climate. \"The domestic markets are coming back pretty fast and fuel prices are coming back fast too,\" he said. Airlines must make long-term bets to remain competitive, even if current conditions still present big problems, Mr Aboulafia said, adding that current low interest rates also encourage making purchases now. The United Airlines move also signals a vote of confidence in planemaker Boeing as it continues to face worries over safety and battles with US regulators. Stan Deal, president and chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said on Tuesday: \"We are truly humbled by United Airlines' confidence in the people of Boeing and the airplanes we design and build every day.  \"Our strong partnership, dating back to United's founding, has helped us grow and weather challenges through the decades.\"",

            "text": "A luxury presidential plane which Mexico had been trying to offload for more than four years has finally arrived in its new home - Tajikistan. President L\u00f3pez Obrador made the sale of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner one of his campaign promises, calling it a symbol of previous governments' excesses. But the specially-outfitted plane proved hard to shift and an attempt to raffle it off failed.  It was finally sold to the Tajik government for $92m (\u00a373.7m). The jet took off from California, where it had been in storage, and arrived in the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, early on Monday. The plane was originally purchased in 2012 by the president at the time, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, for $218m (\u00a3175m). It was then used by Mr Calder\u00f3n's successor, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador vowed to never set foot in it. After taking office, he at first used commercial flights but more recently he has been travelling aboard planes owned by Mexico's armed forces. However, the sale of the plane was beset by problems. While the plane has a luxurious interior, including a presidential bedroom and marble and mahogany finishings, the fact that it was modified to carry only 80 passengers makes it an extremely expensive mode of transport per passenger.  It went on the market on 2 December 2018, a day after Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador was sworn in. When no buyer was found, he suggested raffling off.  But while winning a presidential plane may sound like a dream come true, the sheer cost of storing and maintaining such a jet are astronomical, and the raffle soon became the subject of jokes in Mexico. Instead, the government organised a symbolic raffle, in which buyers could win the value of the plane in cash.  But interest in the symbolic raffle was low, with fewer than 61% of tickets sold. With maintenance costs continuing to add up over the years, the government's relief at finally finding a buyer last month were clearly visible.  In his joy at being rid of the plane and fulfilling his campaign promise, President L\u00f3pez Obrador even boarded the plane and had himself filmed inside its luxurious interior.  The president said the proceeds from the sale would be used to build two new hospitals in Guerrero and Oaxaca state.   Tajikistan officials have not revealed who will be using the jet but as it left the hangar in California where it had been kept, it already had \"Tajikistan\" emblazoned on its body. ",

            "text": "Ryanair has agreed a $40bn (\u00a331bn) deal with Boeing that will see it purchase up to 300 new aircraft over the next decade. Half of the 737-MAX-10 order has been described as firm, with the remaining being options.  The airline claims this is the largest order ever placed by an Irish company for US manufactured goods.  Phased deliveries will start in 2027 and run until 2033. The new aircraft, which have 228 seats, are to be used to meet Ryanair\u2019s traffic which it forecasts will grow by 80% and reach 300m passengers a year by 2034. The airline's chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary described the deal as \"the ideal growth aircraft order for Ryanair, our passengers, our people and our shareholders\u201d. \"These new, fuel efficient, greener technology aircraft offer 21% more seats, burn 20% less fuel and are 50% quieter than our B737-NGs,\" he said.  He added that the deal would enable Ryanair to create more than 10,000 new high-paid jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers. Given the size and scale of the transaction, it will be subject to shareholder approval at Ryanair\u2019s next annual general meeting. Boeing's president and chief executive, Dave Calhoun, said the Boeing-Ryanair partnership is \"one of the most productive in commercial aviation history\". He said it enabled both companies to succeed and expanded affordable travel for the public.  \"Nearly a quarter century after our companies signed our first direct airplane purchase, this landmark deal will further strengthen our partnership,\" he added.  \"We are committed to delivering for Ryanair and helping Europe\u2019s largest airline group achieve its goals by offering its customers the lowest fares in Europe.\u201d",

            "text": "London City Airport's plans to extend its flying times on Saturdays have been rejected. Newham Council's strategic development committee unanimously\u00a0voted against the proposals in a meeting on Monday. Some 1,600 people living near the east London airport objected to the plans, alongside eight other London councils that also cited concerns about noise.  The airport was hoping to see a change to a \"weekend respite\" rule that has been in place for the past 25 years. Under the policy, planes are banned from flying between 1pm on Saturdays and 12.30pm on Sundays so residents can have a break from the noise. City Airport wanted to extend its flying times to 7.30pm during the summer and 6.30pm at other times of year, as well as increasing its daily limit of flights from six to nine between 6.30am and 7am. Lewisham,\u00a0Waltham Forest, Redbridge,\u00a0Southwark,\u00a0Greenwich, Havering,\u00a0Hackney\u00a0and Tower Hamlets councils all submitted objections to Newham Council. Sarah Ruiz, councillor for the Custom House ward, said: \"Only yesterday afternoon I was in a garden in Custom House and it was impossible to sit and enjoy being there because of the noise - 24 hours of quiet time is not a lot to ask for those residents whose lives have been blighted.\" Planning officers had recommended the application be refused, with case officer Liam McFadden telling the committee that the benefits of the scheme were \"insufficient to outweigh or mitigate the substantial harm identified\".

            "text": "Dutch prosecutors investigating the downing of flight MH17 have said they will study any information that Russia provides, after its officials said they had proof the missile that hit the plane was in Ukrainian hands. The Malaysian aircraft went down with the loss of 298 lives in July 2014. Russian officials have repeatedly pointed the finger of blame at Ukraine. They accused an international team of investigators of using fake videos to show the missile had come from Russia. Prosecutors say Russian information so far has been wrong \"on several points\" and previous requests for help have been unanswered. In May, the international joint investigation team (JIT) concluded that the Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down over eastern Ukraine by a Russian-made Buk missile, supplied by the country's 53rd anti-aircraft brigade in Kursk. The team provided images, video, and an animation of a convoy of Buk-Telar rockets heading from Russia in late June 2014, with the Buk in question being transported by a Volvo truck with a white cabin. Australia and the Netherlands said in response to the findings that they held Russia responsible for bringing down the passenger jet, appealing to Russia to accept its responsibility and co-operate fully. In an apparent attempt to hit back at the JIT's conclusions, Russian defence officials alleged on Monday that some of the videos showing the Buk missile system were fabricated, with the tow truck carrying the missile added later.  They said the missile was made at Dolgoprudny outside Moscow in 1986 and then delivered by rail to a military unit in the Ternopol area of Ukraine. They also provided an audio recording, alleging that it showed Ukrainian servicemen in 2016 saying they would bring down \"another Malaysian Boeing\". Russia has given differing accounts over time of how MH17 was shot down in eastern Ukraine, as conflict raged between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces. At one point, Russian officials said the Boeing 777 was downed by a Ukrainian air-to-air missile fired by a Ukrainian fighter. Russian TV even produced a much-ridiculed satellite photograph purporting to show the moment of attack. The joint investigation team in the Netherlands responded to Russia by saying it would \"meticulously study\" its information as soon as the documents were made available. In a statement, the JIT said it had always carefully analysed information provided by Russia, and found that information \"previously presented to the public and provided to the JIT was factually inaccurate on several points\". Russia had left unanswered a request to provide all relevant information in 2014, as well as a specific request last May for details about recovered missile parts, the team said. Investigators highlighted a UN Security Council resolution in 2016 which obliged all states to co-operate fully with the international investigation. Ukraine's Defence Minister Stepan Poltorak dismissed Russia's claim as a lie and \"another fake story\". Eliot Higgins, who set up the Bellingcat online investigation website after the downing of MH17, said Russian defence officials had misinterpreted shadows and objects in their attempt to show there was a problem with lighting in the videos produced by international investigators.",

It said the changes to online check-in would take effect from 13 June.  Ryanair said that even after the change, the check-in window was still double that of many of its rivals. The airline said the move will give customers who have paid for reserved seating more time to pick their seats. Those customers will be allowed to check-in up to 60 days before flying. Seat allocation has become a hot topic for air passengers who suspect airlines of deliberately splitting up family groups in order to try to get them to pay for seats together. This is currently being investigated by the Civil Aviation Authority. Ryanair has come under heavy criticism for its customer service in the past. The airline is now in the fifth year of its \"Always Getting Better\" customer service improvement programme. The carrier's last main change for flyers was to introduce a \u00a35 fee for priority boarding, without that they risked having their main cabin bag being put into the hold at the gate.  That move was delayed after the airline had to cancel hundreds of flights resulting from a rota change and a shortage of pilots.  Ryanair was also hit by a series of industrial actions across Europe in protest at pay, conditions and union recognition, also added to the disruption.  More action is threatened by European unions this summer unless Ryanair adopts national employment laws for all their workers.",

            "text": "The Canadian election campaign is off to a flying start, even if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's plane was grounded by a scraped wing.  A bus ferrying journalists collided with the wing of the Liberal party's chartered Boeing on Wednesday night. Photos show a scrape where the coach roof hit the bottom of the wing of the aircraft at the airport in Victoria, British Columbia.  Mr Trudeau had launched the 40-day federal election campaign that day. He flew his branded campaign plane across the country to the west coast where the mishap occurred. The prime minister was not on the just-landed aircraft at the time of the prang.  \"Maybe our bus driver should have chosen backward, not forward,\" quipped journalist Tonda MacCharles, playing on the Liberal campaign slogan of \"choose forward\".  A Liberal party spokesperson said an assessment is being made of the damage, but added there was no schedule change and the campaign would continue as planned. The Liberal leader is due to fly on a separate plane to the neighbouring province of Alberta for rallies on Thursday afternoon.  The original plane was a Boeing 737-800, with a 189 seat capacity and a wing span of 34.3m (112ft). It was chartered from Montreal-based airline Air Transat.  The Liberal party says it is buying carbon offsets for the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the prime minister's flights.  Journalist Robert Fife pointed out on Twitter this is not the first time a campaign plane had a bus collision mishap in Canada - something similar happened to Mr Trudeau's father, former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, 39 years ago.  British Columbia is expected to be a fierce battleground for multiple political parties, and the Liberals are fighting to hold on to their 17 seats there.  Mr Trudeau is seeking a second term in office after winning a majority government in the 2015 Canadian general election.  Both the Liberals and the Conservatives have campaign planes with the names of their leaders - Mr Trudeau and Andrew Scheer, respectively - emblazoned on the fuselage. Mr Trudeau wasn't the only leader whose campaign faced transportation problems on the first day.  Mr Scheer's plane took off for a rally in the province of Quebec on Wednesday morning only to be diverted by fog.  Journalists and campaign staff were forced to travel by bus for more than an hour in order to reach the first event.  Canadians go to the polls on 21 October. ",

            "title": "Boeing safety system not at fault, says chief executive",
            "text": "Boeing's boss has refused to admit that a system introduced in its 737 Max 8 aircraft was flawed following two fatal plane crashes.  Appearing in front of investors and the media, Dennis Muilenburg maintained the system was only one factor in a chain of events that led to the disasters. But new reports have raised fresh questions about the plane's safety.  It has emerged that whistleblowers connected to Boeing contacted the US airline regulator about the system. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Boeing failed to activate a safety feature linked to sensors on 737 Max planes bought by its biggest customer, Southwest Airlines. The 737 Max is grounded worldwide after an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed near Addis Ababa in March, killing all 157 people on board. It follows a crash by Lion Air in Indonesia five months earlier, which claimed 189 lives. Facing shareholders and the media for the first time since the Ethiopian Airlines tragedy, Mr Muilenburg acknowledged that a common factor in both accidents was faulty data from a sensor triggering the plane's Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) at the wrong time.  The system is designed to improve the handling characteristics of the aircraft and improve stability when the nose is pitched up at a high angle. It was a new addition to the 737 Max when the aircraft was launched in 2017, and was designed to make the aircraft more like the previous generation of 737 to fly.  It works by trimming the nose of the plane downwards. In both accidents, it appears to have activated when the pilots were trying to gain height, depriving them of control. However, Mr Muilenburg said that the MCAS system met its \"design and certification criteria\" and pointed to a number of other scenarios that may have contributed to the fatal accidents including actions taken or not taken by pilots. He added: \"As in most accidents, there are a chain of events that occur. It is not correct to attribute that to any single item.\"  A preliminary report into the Ethiopian Airlines flight found that the plane nosedived several times before hitting the ground.  In the case of the Lion Air flight, a report suggested that the system malfunctioned and forced the plane's nose down more than 20 times before it plummeted into the sea. Boeing has developed and is testing a software update for MCAS.  Mr Muilenburg's comments came after it emerged that several whistleblowers had contacted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) after the Ethiopian Airlines crash to voice concerns about the company's manufacturing processes. One of them reported having seen damage to wiring used by a vital sensor aboard the aircraft - the same sensor that has been implicated in both crashes. An FAA spokesman said the allegations were under investigation and had not been officially substantiated.  Boeing has also come under pressure over the information available to pilots aboard the aircraft, after one of its major customers, Southwest Airlines, told US media it had not been informed that a warning feature previously offered as standard on the 737 had become a paid-for option on the new model.  The feature was a so-called \"AOA Disagree\" alert, meant to inform pilots of significant discrepancies between the information provided by two angle-of-attack sensors in the nose of the aircraft. This would provide a warning if one of them was faulty. The angle of attack sensors are used to determine the angle at which an aircraft encounters the airflow over it. On the 737 Max, the flight computers relied on data from a single one of them to decide when to activate the MCAS system, and a sensor failure is believed to have been a factor in both crashes.  Southwest told the Wall Street Journal it had not been made aware that the warning feature was not available as a standard item until after the Lion Air crash in October.  Mr Muilenburg maintained early on Monday: \"We don't make safety features optional.\"  In a later statement, Boeing then said: \"The disagree alert was intended to be a standard, stand-alone feature on Max airplanes. However, the disagree alert was not operable on all airplanes because the feature was not activated as intended. \"The disagree alert was tied or linked into the angle of attack indicator, which is an optional feature on the Max. Unless an airline opted for the angle of attack indicator, the disagree alert was not operable.\" It said that once the 737 Max 8 returned to the skies, it would have \"an activated and operable disagree alert and an optional angle of attack indicator\". The angle of attack indicator is another instrument available to pilots, designed to warn of a possible aerodynamic stall.  Boeing has already seen a $1bn (\u00a3773m) drop in revenues related to the 737 Max crisis, while some customers have reviewed their orders. On Tuesday, Virgin Australia said it had reached an agreement with Boeing to defer deliveries of 737 Max aircraft.  In a statement, the company said it would delay first deliveries of Boeing Max 737 jets from November 2019 to July 2021. \"We will not introduce any new aircraft to the fleet unless we are completely satisfied with its safety,\" Virgin Australia Chief Executive Paul Scurrah said.

            "text": "Indonesian investigators say the Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 plane crash last year which killed 62 people was due to a faulty throttle system and delayed pilot response. Flight SJ-182 plunged into the Java Sea on 9 January 2021 minutes after take-off from Jakarta, killing all on board.  In their final report, investigators blamed several factors including a repeatedly faulty throttle system. It was Indonesia's third major air accident in the space of six years. Investigators said the plane - which was 26 years old - had an automated throttle system that suffered a malfunction shortly after take-off. That had caused the jet to tilt sharply off-course before it nosedived 3,000m (10,000 ft) into the sea, the National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) said. Previous flight crews had noted the throttle system was \"unserviceable\" and it had received regular repairs, the KNKT said, according to AFP news agency. Investigators also noted that those in the cockpit had not reacted to the plane's deviation in time - perhaps due to complacency that resulted in \"less monitoring\" from the pilots. The investigators noted in their report released on Thursday that this was also the result of a lack of training for pilots on how to react in such emergency situations. The KNKT said the airline had enacted such training since the accident. The Sriwijaya Air crash underscored Indonesia's dismal air safety record, with three major commercial flight crashes in recent years. In 2014, an AirAsia A320 jet crashed during bad weather into the Java Sea, killing 162 people. Four years later, in 2018, a Lion Air Boeing 737 Max plane crashed into the sea, killing 189 people. That flight and the crash of another in Ethiopia months later prompted the grounding worldwide of the Boeing 737 Max, which had a faulty anti-stall system.",

            "text": "A drone flying more than 20 times the allowed height came within 15m (50ft) of a Boeing 737 approaching a runway at Stansted Airport in Essex. The plane was flying at 10,000ft (3km) and coming in to land on 17 August when the captain spotted the drone. The first officer then saw \"a dark-coloured square or rectangle-shaped object pass down the right side of the aircraft with minimal separation\". The UK Airprox Board rated the risk of collision as the highest possible. After the incident, which happened at 16:36 BST, the plane was inspected on the ground and found no evidence of contact or damage. It is not known whether the Boeing 737 was carrying passengers or cargo. The drone operator, who it is understood has not been traced, was in breach of the Air Navigation Order 2009, which refers to flight safety of unmanned craft. Drones must not be flown in airspace above 400ft (121m) or in the vicinity of airports without permission from air traffic control and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The Airprox Board, which investigates near misses, said the drone was \"endangering other aircraft at that location\" and that \"providence had played a major part in the incident\". A CAA spokesman said: \"It is totally unacceptable to fly drones close to airports and anyone flouting the rules can face severe penalties including imprisonment.  \"Anyone operating a drone must do so responsibly and observe all relevant rules and regulations. The rules for flying drones are designed to keep all airspace users safe.\"",

            "title": "BA staff and plane fanatics hunt for 747 souvenirs",
            "text": "The retirement of BA's 747 fleet has led to a bout of nostalgia from staff and plane fanatics keen for souvenirs.\u00a0 Earlier this month, BA announced it was permanently grounding its fleet of 31 747s amid the coronavirus-led slump in travel demand.\u00a0 Some of these iconic planes will end up at a salvage firm at Cotswold Airport.\u00a0 Air Salvage International's owner Mark Gregory says he is getting a stream of inquiries from people keen to grab a piece of aviation history.\u00a0 This week, Boeing said it would stop making the 747 planes as airlines opt for newer and more fuel-efficient planes.\u00a0 Mr Gregory has already taken delivery of three BA 747-400s and another three will be delivered in the coming months. He expects the remainder to be sold to other airlines and operators. The 747 is credited as making long-distance air travel more affordable and has a history stretching back five decades. As it slowly disappears, a market is developing for souvenirs, ranging from seats to side panels. \"I get a daily stream of emails from BA staff and 747 fanatics who want to buy a piece of a plane. A cut-out side section is popular which can be hung on the wall. These usually go for about \u00a3200 each,\" said Mr Gregory.\u00a0 \"They are good aircraft and have done a lot of hours. They have definitely earned their keep.\" His salvage and trading company has been operating for more than 20 years out of Cotswold Airport, a private airfield near Kemble which was once owned by the Ministry of Defence.\u00a0 But it's not just BA that is offloading its 747s. Other major airlines are also waving goodbye to their planes.\u00a0 Last week, Australian national carrier Qantas said farewell to the last of its Boeing 747s. The final flight of a Qantas 747 drew a massive kangaroo shape in the sky as it left Sydney Airport.\u00a0 Since the coronavirus outbreak, Air Salvage International has seen a ten-fold increase in inquiries from a number of airlines looking for storage facilities. \"We have 11 747s parked up currently. Some are being dismantled while others are up for sale including the BA 747s,\"\u00a0added Mr Gregory. Cotswold Airport has capacity for more than 100 aircraft. A division of his business looks after the dismantling and selling on of aircraft parts. Engines make up around 80% of the value of a retired plane.  While some engines can easily sell for $3m (\u00a32.3m) each, the Rolls-Royce ones on the BA 747-400s are likely to sell for less. Other potentially valuable parts include the wheels and the brakes. But there's a saturated market for 747 spare parts as more are taken out of service and dismantled.\u00a0 Most retired planes are either dismantled, sold to other airlines or left in storage, often in deserts. Some are also kept by airlines who use the cockpits to train pilots.  On rare occasions, entrepreneurs buy planes to convert them into a restaurant, hotel or restore for a private collection. \"Most of these other requests are generally visionaries with little or no budget,\" added Mr Gregory.\u00a0 Some of the retired aircraft have even made their way into the movies and scrap parts have been featured in many of the Star Wars films, including Rogue One.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"The engines and parts are worth more if you take them off than if you try to sell the aircraft as a flying machine.\" \u00a0 The process to dismantle a plane can take around eight weeks for a narrow-bodied passenger jet such as a Boeing 737 or an Airbus A320, while for giants such as a Boeing 747 or 777 it can take 10 to 15 weeks.\u00a0 The aviation industry is facing a significant challenge of how to deal with its ageing aircraft, along with a sharp fall in passenger numbers.  Of more than 27,000 commercial aircraft in service globally, over 20% are older than 20 years and likely to be decommissioned in the coming decade, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization. It estimated last year that more than 20,000 commercial aircraft will be retired over the next 20 years, but that was before the virus pandemic devastated the airline industry. The 747-400, which is the model BA is phasing out, first began flying in 1988.  Boeing sold almost 700 of the 747-400s, making them the best-selling version of the long-range airliner. Now that most are more than 20 years old, they are gradually being retired.\u00a0 But the very first 747s date back to 1969, with Boeing celebrating their 50th anniversary last year.",

            "title": "Boeing astronaut Starliner capsule lands after incomplete mission",
            "text": "The Boeing company has cut short the uncrewed demonstration flight of its new astronaut capsule. The Starliner launched successfully on its Atlas rocket from Florida, but then suffered technical problems that prevented it from taking the right path to the International Space Station. It appears the capsule burnt too much fuel as it fired its thrusters, leaving an insufficient supply to complete its planned mission. Starliner came back to Earth on Sunday. It landed in New Mexico's White Sands testing range, using parachutes and airbags to make a soft touchdown on desert terrain. It marked the first US land-landing for this type vehicle. Past crewed capsules have always made splashdowns in the ocean. Boeing and the US space agency (Nasa) must now review the truncated mission before deciding when to allow crew to fly aboard future Starliners.  While this automated demonstration ticked off many of its objectives, such as a safe entry, descent and landing - it failed to achieve other key ones, the most significant being a rendezvous and docking with the space station.      The Administrator of Nasa, Jim Bridenstine, said in a press conference on Friday that Starliner had experienced a timing \"anomaly\" shortly after launch. This led the capsule to become confused over where it was in its mission sequence. Starliner then expended an excessive amount of propellant trying to maintain very precise pointing, or attitude.  Flight controllers recognised the problem but were unable to intervene quickly enough because the capsule was passing between satellite links. Mr Bridenstine remained upbeat, taking the positives out of the day's events. \"A lot of things went right,\" he said. \"This is why we test.\" The Administrator then suggested that had astronauts been in the capsule, they could have helped re-direct the craft to the space station. Nasa astronaut Mike Fincke, who has already been selected to fly on a future Starliner, agreed with this assessment. \"Had we been on board, we could have given the flight control team more options on what to do in this situation,\" he said. Not since 2011, when the shuttles were retired, have Americans launched from their own soil; US astronauts have been hitching rides in Russian Soyuz capsules instead. The Starliner, and another capsule called Dragon from the SpaceX company, have been developed to reinstate the capability. The business model will be different from the past, however.  Instead of owning and operating the new capsules, Nasa will simply buy seats in the craft. And Boeing and SpaceX will also be free to sell any spare capacity to others - to other space agencies and commercial concerns. The agency \"seeded\" Starliner and Dragon under its Commercial Crew Program (CCP). The companies were given milestone payments to encourage the development of their capsules. The vehicles are late, however; they should have been flying in 2017.  That they are still at the demonstration stage is due in part to Congress squeezing the amount of money Nasa could spend on the initiative. But also because of technical set-backs, such as the explosive destruction of a Dragon capsule on a test stand. The SpaceX craft does look closer to entering service, though, after completing its own uncrewed trial in March. Whether Boeing will now have to repeat its test flight, going all the way to the station, before it can join Dragon on the \"taxi rank\" is uncertain. \"I think it's too early to make that assessment,\" Mr Bridenstein said.  It's still possible Boeing and Nasa may decide to move directly to crewed flights.  Mike Fincke's Nasa astronaut colleague on the upcoming Starliner mission will be Nicole Mann. \"We are looking forward to flying on Starliner. We don't have any safety concerns,\" she commented.",

According to Dutch broadcaster NOS, the man's body temperature was raised at the scene and by the time an ambulance arrived, he was able to answer basic questions.  A spokesperson for freight carrier Cargolux confirmed in an email to Reuters that the stowaway had been on a flight operated by Cargolux Italia. According to flight data, the only Cargolux freight flight from Johannesburg to Schiphol on Sunday also made a stop in Nairobi. It is not known if the man boarded the plane in South Africa or Kenya.

            "title": "The low-cost airline changing the way we fly",
            "text": "On Wednesday, the first ever budget flight from London to South America departs from Gatwick airport.  Fares on the 14-hour Norwegian Air Shuttle flight to Buenos Aires start from \u00a3259 one-way.  The seats are tightly packed and food and luggage cost extra, but the no-frills model of flying, so well established on short-haul routes, is becoming increasingly common on intercontinental flights.  A new breed of low-cost carriers such as Norwegian, Wow, and Primera are taking on the old guard such as British Airways and Air France-KLM in the skies above the Atlantic.  In fact, Norwegian has just beaten British Airways's record for the fastest transatlantic flight in a subsonic aircraft after one of its planes made the journey from JFK in New York to London Gatwick in just five hours and 13 minutes. Norwegian has rapidly expanded since it started as a small regional airline flying between Bergen and Trondheim in 1993. Bjorn Kjos, a former paratrooper and pilot, has turned Norwegian into Scandinavia's largest airline and the third-biggest budget carrier in Europe. The UK has been at the centre of its growth plan. It flew 5.8 million passengers from the UK and Ireland and launched more than 15 routes in 2017, including new routes between Edinburgh, Belfast, Dublin, Cork and Shannon to smaller east coast US cities such as Providence, Hartford and Stewart.  But it is Gatwick that is the key to the airline's ambitions.  Whilst legacy carriers tend to focus on the more lucrative but expensive takeoff and landing slots at London Heathrow, Norwegian recently secured an additional 28 weekly slots at Gatwick.  It hopes to build on its existing routes to nine US cities, Singapore and now Buenos Aires.    \"The UK will be at the heart of our continued global expansion and we remain fully committed to the market. With huge global ambitions, we're confident that the UK can offer Norwegian a springboard to further expansion.\" says 71-year-old Mr Kjos.  He is talking to journalists on the 24th floor of The Shard skyscraper in central London. The message isn't subtle. Norwegian has towering ambitions. It won the prestigious 'Airline of the Year' award from the CAPA Aviation Awards for Excellence. The judges commenting: \"Norwegian has blazed a trail that others are now following. The impact on new North Atlantic traffic in what was previously considered a mature market has already been remarkable.\" If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then British Airways' parent company, IAG, is paying Norwegian plenty of compliments. First it duplicated Norwegian's routes such as Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale in Florida and Barcelona to Oakland in California. Now BA engineers are busy squeezing an extra 52 seats into Gatwick-based Boeing 777 aircraft. The specific aim of \"densification\": to reduce BA's per-passenger costs below Norwegian's 787. Four decades ago, Sir Freddie Laker triggered alarm among transatlantic airlines with his cut-price Skytrain, which went bust in 1982. The aviation pioneer went to his grave in 2006 convinced that rivals had ganged up in a bitter price war to force Laker Airways out of business. But ambitious expansion during a global recession also made the airline vulnerable.  Last year Bjorn Kjos, Norwegian's CEO, honoured Sir Freddie on the tailfin of a transatlantic Boeing. He must be hoping for calmer skies. Norwegian's price strategy is based on flying a young fleet of aircraft such as Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, which burn less fuel per passenger compared to other long haul aircraft.  These offer passengers a more upmarket experience than they may have come to expect from a budget airline with modern interiors and the benefit of free wi-fi on all routes in the future..  This has especially appealed to millennial travellers and the airline has configured its planes so they can carry more economy passengers seeking adventure at bargain prices.   The airline has marketed fares as low as \u00a369 ($95) for some transatlantic flights but passengers would have to pay for add-ons such as checked luggage, onboard food and a reserved seat.  Another way Norwegian reduces costs is by flying to secondary airports where the landing fees are much lower and finding niche routes where there is a gap. For example, instead of flying to San Francisco, Norwegian flies to nearby Oakland.  With the competition heating up, legacy carriers such as BA have been criticised for trying to keep prices low by relentlessly cutting back on \"frills\".   But they have also fought back by trying to outmuscle their low-cost long haul competitors by launching their own services. Last year, BA's owner launched Level, a new trans-Atlantic budget airline.  Air France-KLM have launched its own long-haul budget carrier Joon, aimed at \"a young working clientele whose lifestyles revolve around digital technology\". But despite imitations, Norwegian's rapid rise has led some to question whether its financial model is sustainable.  By the end of 2019, Norwegian's fleet will have increased to 193 and the airline has borrowed heavily to buy new aircraft.  Aviation analyst John Strickland cautions that: \"They just haven't delivered the margins of profitability you'd want to see, especially when compared with British Airways or Ryanair. \"They will have to work harder to prove they have a sustainable model and can weather the many storms an airline can face, such as economic downturns or reduced passenger numbers after a terror attack\"  Unsurprisingly, in the fiercely competitive world of commercial aviation Norwegian has found itself the target of its rivals in other ways. Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, has shunned transatlantic routes because it says it can't get aeroplanes at a price to make the numbers work Last year, its outspoken chief executive, Michael O'Leary, ruffled feathers by questioning Norwegian's survival. \"Both Monarch and Norwegian are in trouble. It's an open secret among airlines that Monarch and Norwegian may not survive through the winter. They are burning cash.\" Monarch collapsed months later. Norwegian is still flying and expanding.  Bjorn Kjos seems to take pride in all the predictions of decline. Some argue he has just been lucky, but for the septuagenarian who has changed the rules of flying, he doesn't think it is down to luck.  \"Yes it is tough but you have to ramp it up before you start flying. It takes time to build up a network. After a huge investment, you will not be able to pay it off after one month.  \"People have to know you are flying all over. And when they do, then you are the winner.\"",

            "text": "Air New Zealand's bid to trademark the image of the words \"Kia Ora,\" the title of its in-flight magazine, has prompted threats of a boycott.  The phrase kia ora is a Maori greeting and the trademark attempt has sparked anger from the indigenous community. The airline said it wants to trademark the magazine logo, not the phrase itself.  The New Zealand Maori Council described the move as \"cultural misappropriation\" and \"frankly despicable\".  The council is a statutory body set up to represent the Maori community.   \"My warning to Air New Zealand is I sure as hell will put a stop to this,\" head of the council Matthew Tukaki said.   \"If they don't pull back, [I] will take them to the court system, I will bring on a national campaign boycotting the airline and I will snap them where it hurts.\"  He said Maori people spend \"tens of millions of dollars\" on domestic and international travel with the airline.  Air New Zealand is no stranger to controversies involving the Maori community, which make up about 15% of the country's population. It recently said it would end a ban on staff having visible tattoos after the restrictions drew criticism of the airline's treatment of Maori culture. In a statement to the BBC, Air New Zealand said it had \"great respect\" for the Maori language and that the trademark application only referred to the airline's in-flight magazine title. \"This is simply about protecting the logo,\" a spokesperson said.  \"It's standard corporate practice to have all our logos trademarked and we have just started the process given Kia Ora magazine has recently been through a refresh.\" Still, Mr Tukaki said he would fight the move until the airline dropped the application altogether. \"This is cultural misappropriation 101. For a private company to go and attempt to trademark a word that does not belong to them but call it a logo is quite frankly despicable.\"",

            "title": "Ethiopian Airlines: What do we know about Boeing 737 Max 8?",
            "text": "The Ethiopian Airlines tragedy marks the second fatal crash within five months involving a new type of Boeing aircraft. The Boeing 737 Max 8 has only been in commercial use since 2017. In October last year a Lion Air Boeing 737 Max went down shortly after take-off from Jakarta, Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board. That aircraft was less than three months old. Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 also went down just minutes after take-off.  The aircraft - registration ET-AVJ - first flew in October 2018, according to flight tracking websites. Jakarta-based aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman told the BBC the 737 Max's \"engine is a bit further forward and a bit higher in relation to the wing, compared to the previous version of the plane. That affects the balance of the plane\". The Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee indicated that Lion Air flight 610 experienced \"erroneous input\" from one of its sensors designed to alert pilots if the aeroplane is at risk of stalling. The inquiry has not yet reached any final conclusions about the cause of the disaster. The sensor and connected software work in a different way to previous models of the 737, but pilots had not been told that. Within days of the Lion Air crash, the aircraft maker Boeing issued an operations bulletin to airlines. The US aviation regulator then issued an \"emergency\" airworthiness directive to US carriers about this sensor - a so-called Angle of Attack (AOA) sensor. The Federal Aviation Administration said the sensor \"condition, if not addressed, could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane, and lead to excessive nose-down attitude, significant altitude loss, and possible impact with terrain\". US airlines were told to update information flight manuals for air crew. At the time the FAA said the information was passed on to other national aviation regulators. The expectation was that regulators would inform airlines and they in turn would update pilots. Aviation sources say it almost certain that Ethiopian Airlines pilots would have been updated on the sensor issue. There is no immediate evidence to suggest the Ethiopia Airlines jet has encountered the same difficulties as the Lion Air flight. Aviation analyst John Strickland of JLS Consulting told the BBC: \"There will be attention to the fact that this was a very new aircraft, the same type as that involved in the recent Lion Air accident and in a similar phase of flight - but detailed work taking time will be required to establish the cause.\" In a statement on Sunday, Boeing said a \"technical team is prepared to provide technical assistance at the request and under the direction of the US National Transportation Safety Board\". It has also said it extended its \"heartfelt sympathies to the families and loved ones of the passengers and crew on board and stand ready to support the Ethiopian Airlines team\". The Boeing 737 Max has been the fastest-selling aircraft in Boeing's history, with more than 4,500 ordered by 100 different operators globally. The initial findings of the investigation in Ethiopia will determine what action regulators and airlines take.  Ethiopian Airlines is regarded as Africa's leading airline. Analyst John Strickland said it is \"also recognised globally as a high-quality professionally-run company\".",

            "text": "The US trade investigation to which Bombardier is being subjected is a complex, multi-stage process. It involves the interplay of two government agencies, the Department of Commerce and the US International Trade Commission (USITC). The USITC effectively ruled there was an arguable case against Bombardier, moving the complaint to the next stage. Now, it is up to the Department of Commerce to make a preliminary finding on whether Bombardier has in fact received subsides or is selling below cost. That is the verdict which is due to be delivered this week. There is a growing consensus among aerospace and trade experts that the finding will go against Bombardier. The Department of Commerce could announce a preliminary tariff on the C-Series, raising the cost of importing the plane to the United States. That should not have a huge immediate practical impact as it will be the spring of 2018 before Bombardier delivers any C-Series to Delta, its US customer. If the finding does go against Bombardier, the investigation moves to the next stage, with attention switching back to the USITC for its final ruling. The role of the USITC at this stage is to assess if damage has been caused to a US company, in this case Boeing, as a result of the subsides or below cost selling. This verdict, due to be delivered in February 2018, will be the key one. But even that may not be the end of the process. USITC determinations can be appealed to the US Court of International Trade or, as this is a case involving Canada, to a disputes panel of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Ultimately the government of Canada could pursue a case against the US at the World Trade Organisation.",

The aircraft made its final flight from Heathrow Airport on 8 October as more than 18,000 people watched a live stream of the event on Facebook. It landed at Cotswold Airport in Kemble where it will be used for a range of events beginning next spring.  BA brought forward the retirement of its fleet of 747-400 aircraft due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The aircraft type was known as the Queen of the Skies, and the one in Kemble is painted in Negus livery which adorned the airline's planes in the 1970s and 1980s.  It will be converted for use as a museum, cinema and for school visits, as well as a business, conferencing and private hire venue. A portion of the money raised from events will be used to support Cotswold Airport's scholarship programme and charities.  \"There is such a huge amount of interest in her as British Airways' last commercially operated 747 and with the historic livery in which she is painted as well,\" said Suzannah Harvey, chief executive of Cotswold Airport. \"We've got a very good support network building already which will help to maintain and preserve her for the future.\"  Boeing announced it would stop making the 747 planes in July, as airlines opt for newer and more fuel-efficient aircraft. BA planned to retire the planes in 2024 but the date was brought forward due to the downturn in the travel industry caused by Covid-19. The first Boeing 747 flight took off in February 1969 and it was the first aeroplane dubbed a jumbo jet. Sean Doyle, chief executive of British Airways, said: \"It was with great sadness that we retired our two final 747s based at Heathrow, so we're glad Cotswold Airport is able to give one of these aircraft a new home and a new lease of life.\" Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

            "text": "Air India has ordered 470 new aircraft - a record for the aviation industry - as the carrier pushes to become bigger global player.  Chairman N Chandrasekaran said the airline had its sights set on becoming \"a world-class proposition\". He said the orders from Europe's Airbus and US-based Boeing would modernise the airline's fleet and help it to \"dramatically\" expand its network.  The first aircraft will go into service at the end of this year.  \"Air India is on a large transformation journey,\" Mr Chandrasekaran said in a statement announcing the deals. \"This order is an important step in realising Air India's ambition... to offer a world-class proposition serving global travellers with an Indian heart.\" Air India said it was looking to Airbus to supply 250 planes, and Boeing for another 220 jets to help catalyse its revival. The orders come less than two years after the Indian government sold the airline to Tata Group, India's largest conglomerate, which had founded the company in 1932. Nationalised in 1953, the airline long preserved a reputation for being a top-tier carrier, with customers that included George Harrison and The Doors. But competition ramped up in the 1990s and the firm started racking up losses after its 2007 merger with the state-owned domestic operator, Indian Airlines.  The company lost ground to rivals, such as IndiGo and Emirates, Qatar Airways, Etihad and other Middle Eastern carriers, which now handle much of the overseas travel to and from India.  These orders could change that, said aviation analyst Mark Martin, but the airline - which made its last aircraft purchase nearly 20 years ago - will face the challenge of rapidly modernising its operations, including software, maintenance and its systems for the new aircraft.  \"If they are successful, they will take India's uniqueness to the globe once again, after many years,\" Mr Martin said.  Air travel in India has rebounded more quickly from the pandemic than in many other markets, fuelled by a fast-growing economy and an expanding middle class. Boeing and Airbus expect that demand to continue to rise. The country's economic and geopolitical importance has also increased as Western relations with China grow more uncertain and firms look for other markets to propel their growth.  French President Emmanuel Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi appeared with the company in a press conference announcing the Airbus deal.  Mr Modi later wrote on Twitter that the orders reflected a \"robust\" relationship between India and France and would strengthen his country's aviation industry.  Separately, US President Joe Biden hailed the \"historic\" Boeing order as a sign of a \"deepening partnership\" between the two countries, and one that would support more than a million jobs in the US.  UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also said the orders would help create 450 jobs in the UK, since the engines will be supplied by Rolls-Royce.  \"By building trade ties with growing economic powers like India we will ensure UK businesses remain at the forefront of global growth and innovation,\" he said in a statement.",

            "text": "At an undisclosed location Airbus has spent months testing a radical looking plane. At 10ft (3m) wide, it is only small, but it could be the start of something very big in the aerospace industry. It looks like a flying wedge - known in the trade as a blended-wing design. Airbus calls the remote-controlled aircraft Maveric and is keen to emphasise that, at the moment, it is only exploring how the configuration works. But it says the design has \"great potential\". One day it could be scaled up to the size of a regular passenger jet. In traditional aircraft the fuselage is basically dead weight and needs big wings to keep it in the sky. Under a blended-wing design, the whole airframe provides lift, so it can be lighter and smaller than current designs, but can potentially carry the same payload. Maveric is one of several initiatives from Airbus, and there are many by other aerospace firms, to meet an industry target to halve emissions from air travel by 2050, compared to 2005 levels. \"There is a really big challenge there. And there is a big expectation from society which we think it is our duty to find answers to,\" says Sandra Bour-Schaeffer, the chief executive of Airbus UpNext, which evaluates new technologies for the European aerospace giant. \"We believe that we have to go into a really\u2026 breakthrough technology,\" she says. An equally radical idea is being explored at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Researchers there are working on a design known as the \"Flying-V\". It is a new concept for a long-haul aircraft, which they claim would be up to 20% more efficient than a state-of-the-art modern plane such as the Airbus A350. Like Maveric, it abandons the idea of a conventional fuselage. But in this case the shape is more like an arrowhead, with two wings stretching out behind the cockpit in a V. Passengers and cargo would be carried within the wings themselves. The designers think it would be cheaper to build than the blended wing because the two arms of the V could be \"plugged\" into the rest of the fuselage. So the aircraft could be built in parts, rather than all at once. \"We think we can keep the manufacturing costs relatively low, compared to concepts that would have more unique components,\" says Roelof Vos, the project lead for the Flying-V and an assistant professor at Delft University of Technology. The design was originally the brainchild of a graduate student, and formed part of his thesis. It is being developed with support from the Dutch airline KLM and Airbus - and in July a scale model took to the skies for the first time, from an airbase in Germany. The flight of the test aircraft - a battery-powered drone with a 9ft wingspan - was deemed a success. Researchers said the machine performed well, although it did suffer from a kind of aerodynamic wobbling, known as \"Dutch roll\". This made it difficult to keep the wings level, and resulted in what they described as \"a somewhat rough landing\" that damaged the front landing gear. Data from those tests is currently being analysed and incorporated into a flight test simulator. Airlines have seen their sales slump due to the pandemic, but despite that KLM says it will continue to support research into the Flying-V. The attractions of more efficient aircraft are obvious, for an industry where cost control is vital to profitability, and which is under intense pressure to reduce its environmental impact. But with the basic layout of commercial aircraft having gone unchanged for decades, there are other practical issues to consider - some of which avionics expert Steve Wright of the University of the West of England describes as \"showstoppers\". More Technology of Business Among them are how passengers board or leave the aircraft. In the case of the blended wing, for example, the wide central section could make the boarding process take longer, while passengers in the middle would be a long way from the exits in an emergency. There's also the question of passenger comfort. Those sitting close to the side of the aircraft - and effectively close to the edge of the \"wing\" - would experience much greater movement when the aircraft is banking, while take-off and landing would have to be at steeper angles than normal. Building a new type of aircraft would also present a challenge to the aerospace industry. Airbus, for example, makes sections and components of existing aircraft all over Europe, before bringing them for final assembly in Hamburg and Toulouse. It is a tried and tested supply chain, using the specific expertise present in each region. \"That well-oiled manufacturing machine... it would certainly be strained and would have to be redesigned,\" says Mr Wright. Airbus insists that issues such as these are already under consideration and would be considered as part of the design process - but there's little doubt a design such as the blended wing or Flying-V would represent a major gamble for a manufacturer. Its rival Boeing has spent years studying a concept that is less obviously radical, but still a clear departure from what we have now: the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing. Aircraft equipped with the wing would look relatively conventional, with a central fuselage. But the wing itself would be much longer and thinner, and would be braced by a support, or truss, angled up from beneath the fuselage. The wing would fold to make accessing conventional airport gates easier. Boeing says the new design would need 9% less fuel than a conventional design. But current research is not only focused on aerodynamics. There's also the question of how future aircraft are powered. For short-range flights, with a limited number of passengers, battery power might be viable. Projects such as the Eviation Alice - shown off at the 2019 Paris Airshow - are based on proving that concept. For longer distances, batteries are currently impractical, because they are simply too heavy and do not contain enough energy to compensate for that weight. The industry has explored other options, such as hybridisation - in which part of the thrust needed to fly is provided by electric power. One major research project was Airbus's E-Fan X, a partnership between Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens. It involved fitting a single 2MW (2,700hp) electric motor, powered by an on-board generator, to a four-engined BAe 146 test plane. But the experiment was cancelled last year - before the system could be tested in flight - as the effects of the Covid outbreak led Airbus to review its priorities. Those priorities now include research into hydrogen propulsion. Airbus has pledged to build the world's first zero-emission aircraft by 2035. Its plans rely on creating hybrid systems, using hydrogen-burning gas turbine engines as well as hydrogen fuel cells to generate electric power. In September, Airbus unveiled three concept hydrogen-powered designs. Hydrogen fuel could even be combined with a radical design - one of the concepts included the blended wing. But there is a significant problem here. Most of our hydrogen supplies today are derived from methane - a fossil fuel - which is mixed with steam at high pressures. It is an energy-intensive process that creates significant quantities of carbon dioxide. In order to be truly zero emission, aircraft would need to be powered by hydrogen produced in a much more environmentally friendly way - and large quantities would be needed. But according to Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus vice president for zero-emission aircraft, society itself will eventually provide the solution. \"Over the next decade, in order for society at large to meet the Paris Agreement, to meet our climate targets, we need to shift to renewable hydrogen,\" he explains.",

            "text": "Bosses from the world's two biggest plane makers have called on the US government to delay the rollout of new 5G phone services. In a letter, top executives at Boeing and Airbus warned that the technology could have \"an enormous negative impact on the aviation industry.\" Concerns have previously been raised that C-Band spectrum 5G wireless could interfere with aircraft electronics. US telecoms giants AT&T and Verizon are due to deploy 5G services on 5 January. \"5G interference could adversely affect the ability of aircraft to safely operate,\" said the bosses of Boeing and Airbus Americas, Dave Calhoun and Jeffrey Knittel, in a joint letter to US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The letter cited research by trade group Airlines for America which found that if the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) 5G rules had been in effect in 2019, about 345,000 passenger flights and 5,400 cargo flights would have faced delays, diversions or cancellations. The aviation industry and the FAA have raised concerns about potential interference of 5G with sensitive aircraft equipment like radio altitude meters. \"Airbus and Boeing have been working with other aviation industry stakeholders in the US to understand potential 5G interference with radio altimeters,\" Airbus said in a statement. \"An Aviation Safety Proposal to mitigate potential risks has been submitted for consideration to the US Department of Transportation.\" This month, the FAA issued airworthiness directives warning 5G interference could result in flight diversions, saying it would provide more information before the 5 January rollout date. In November, AT&T and Verizon delayed the commercial launch of C-band wireless service by a month until 5 January and adopted precautionary measures to limit interference. Aviation industry groups have said the measures did not go far enough, with Boeing and Airbus saying they made a counterproposal that would limit cellular transmissions around airports and other critical areas. Last week, United Airlines chief executive Scott Kirby said the FAA's 5G directives would bar the use of radio altitude meters at about 40 of America's biggest airports. The US wireless industry group CTIA has said 5G is safe and accused the aviation industry of fearmongering and distorting facts. \"A delay will cause real harm. Pushing back deployment one year would subtract $50bn in economic growth, just as our nation recovers and rebuilds from the pandemic,\" CTIA chief executive Meredith Attwell Baker said in a blog post last month.",

            "text": "Drones and sonar technology have been deployed in Indonesia to search for a Lion Air passenger plane which crashed into the sea on Monday. Flight JT 610 went down after taking off from Jakarta with 189 passengers and crew on board. There has been no sign of survivors but debris and personal belongings have been collected from the water.  There is no indication yet of what caused the plane to go down 13 minutes after taking off.  Officials say the pilot of the Boeing 737, which was heading for the western city of Pangkal Pinang, had asked to return to Soekarno-Hatta airport shortly before losing contact with air traffic control.  A log obtained by the BBC showed the plane had encountered technical problems while flying from Bali to Jakarta the previous day. The log showed one instrument was giving \"unreliable\" airspeed readings and the captain had to hand over to the first officer. Altitude readings also differed on the captain and first officer's instruments.  Lion Air's chief executive Edward Sirait said on Tuesday that the plane had been repaired before taking off again. By Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Jakarta Another day of waiting for the families and loved ones of those on board.  Now they sit outside Jakarta's police hospital where bodies are being brought. Lion Air is providing free flights from Bangka for families, like Surya's.  \"They have all come hoping for some closure and certainty,\" she says.  Her younger sister was on the plane. \"We want a body to grieve. She was the youngest in our family, so we all loved her very much. It feels very painful to lose the baby of the family.\" Outside the hospital I meet Murtado Kurinawan, whose newly-wed wife was on the plane, travelling for work.  He has brought her toothbrush in the hope it will help with the identification process.  \"I can't stop thinking about her. Her face fills my mind all the time,\" he said.  The plane plunged in coastal waters that are about 30m (100ft) deep north-east of Jakarta. Investigators say they are hopeful of finding the main fuselage. Search teams are using an underwater drone, as well as underwater \"pinger locators\" to try to pick up the sonar signals from the cockpit recorders. Search teams have been retrieving body parts, aircraft debris and personal items.  Body bags are being taken to Jakarta for identification.  Another search official, Yusuf Latif, earlier said it would be \"a miracle\" if survivors were found. Mr Sutopo has also warned against hoaxes that have been spreading on social media, including pictures that users claimed were taken by passengers in their last moments before the plane went down. In a statement, Boeing said it stood \"ready to provide technical assistance to the accident investigation\". Indonesia, a vast archipelago, is heavily reliant on air travel but many of its airlines have a poor safety record. The country has had issues of safety and poor management in the past and its airlines were banned from flying into European airspace until 2016.",

            "text": "Firms such as Airbus in Flintshire face new \"constraints\" in moving parts and staff between its European sites, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator warned. Michel Barnier said the UK could not have \"frictionless\" trade outside the single market and customs union. He also said Britain had \"more to lose\" than the remaining 27 states if it crashed out of the EU without a deal.  Senior Airbus vice-president Katherine Bennett said she was confident the firm would \"get over\" any new restrictions. UK ministers have said they want trade with the EU once it leaves the bloc to be as \"frictionless as possible\". Mr Barnier was giving an update on Brexit on Thursday to a meeting in Brussels of the European Economic and Social Committee, an advisory group representing employers, trade unions and other interest groups. He stressed that the EU did not want to \"punish\" the UK for leaving the bloc, but suggested British politicians had not \"fully understood\" the EU's position on free movement, the single market and its rules and regulations. Brexit without a trade deal could result in \"very cumbersome\" customs procedures, Mr Barnier warned, with UK firms facing delays of days rather than hours on every export of goods to the EU. He named the Airbus wings plant, which employs 6,000 at Broughton, Flintshire, as the type of operation which depended on integration with continental Europe. It drew skilled staff from across the EU, Mr Barnier said, and relied on EU rules to ease shipments of its aircraft wings to assembly lines in France and Germany. \"Trade will never be as fluid for a country which makes the choice to leave the single market and the customs union,\" he warned. Katherine Bennett, senior vice-president of Airbus, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One on Thursday the company was most worried about the prospect of restrictions on the movement of employees in high technology jobs. But she added: \"We will get over these barriers. \"We're a very integrated company and we do have people from around the world but we have a large percentage of people who are 'other EU' citizens,\" she said.  \"It's really important that we explain to our government and of course to the European Commission about the importance of that integrated arrangement being able to continue.\" In January, Airbus chief operating officer Tom Williams told MPs the company would be \"entering a dangerous phase\" if it could not seamlessly move people and products around the EU. He told the Commons Treasury Select Committee that American competitors such as Boeing would be \"delighted\" if that happened. However, Boeing Europe president Sir Michael Arthur later wrote to the committee pointing out it had more than 2,000 staff in the UK, which was a \"critically important market, supplier base and source of technology partners\" for the company. He said Boeing was \"as keen as any company for the UK and the EU to be successful in the future, giving our presence and supply chain partnerships, which we intend to continue to grow\".",

            "text": "Ryanair has said it still expects to make record annual profits this year, despite disruptions to its schedules that led it to cancel 20,000 flights. The Irish airline said it made profits of \u20ac1.29bn (\u00a31.14bn) in the six months to the end of September and forecast a full-year profit of up to \u20ac1.45bn. Chief operations officer Michael Hickey resigned following the mishap. The cancellations arose because pilots' rosters had to be changed to comply with new aviation rules. Ryanair's shares closed 6.39% higher at \u20ac16.82 each. The flight cancellations were announced in September and would not have made much difference to the first-half profits. However, rival airlines have reported an increase in bookings following the cancellations, as passengers were afraid of the effect on future Ryanair flights. Ryanair 'run like a communist regime' Ryanair passengers left 'furious'  Ryanair backs down over passenger rights Ryanair's chief financial officer Neil Sorahan said he was \"absolutely confident\" that the airline would have enough pilots and standby pilots for next summer. Mr Sorahan said the rostering problem was caused by human error, not a systems failure. He said pilots at 10 of its 86 bases had approved a new pay deal and that management continued to engage with pilots. The airline said its new deal offered \"materially higher\" pay, \"with better career prospects, superior rosters and much better job security than Norwegian, among others can offer.\" It said pilots based at Dublin and Stansted airports would be earning 20% more than at Norwegian. It added that these measures \"will not significantly alter the substantial cost advantage we have over all other EU airline competitors\". Aviation expert John Strickland of JLS Consulting told the BBC that Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary wanted to \"nail\" stories about the number of pilots who were leaving for rival airlines. He added that Ryanair was \"a big Boeing 737 operator - it's the same aircraft type and that is a straight 'walkover for crew', so if crew perceive that life is better at Norwegian, either financially or in terms of working arrangements, they can go there.\" Mr Strickland said Mr O'Leary wanted to persuade crew that Ryanair was paying better and had \"far better\" financial prospects. Ryanair said it had reduced fares by 5% in the first half of the financial year and that fares for the second half would fall by between 4% and 6%. Mr O'Leary said:  \"These strong H1 results reinforce the robust nature of Ryanair's low fare, pan-European growth model, even during a period which suffered a material failure in our pilot rostering function.\" He denounced what he called \"misinformation about Ryanair promoted by competitor pilot unions\", saying: \"The reason they wish to denigrate Ryanair is because their airlines cannot compete with us.\" He said: \"We will continue to work hard to deliver for our people, our customers and our shareholders while these competitor unions will continue to rail and fail.\"",

            "title": "Cobham: National security fears threaten defence takeover",
            "text": "The government is to intervene in a US private equity firm's takeover of UK defence and aerospace firm Cobham, citing national security concerns. Advent International made a \u00a34bn offer to buy Cobham in July and shareholders approved the deal last month. But Cobham's founding family raised concerns about the company's future and its connections with UK defence. The government said it wanted to \"support private sector innovation whilst safeguarding public interest\". Dorset-based Cobham, which employs 10,000 people, is known for pioneering technology enabling the mid-air refuelling of planes. The firm also makes electronic warfare systems and communications for military vehicles. \"Following careful consideration of the proposed takeover of Cobham, I have issued an intervention notice on the grounds of national security,\" said Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will investigate and carry out a review on the national security implications of the transaction.  The government has the power to veto the deal if the CMA finds there are sufficient concerns.  It must report the results of its decision by 29 October.  Since 2002, the government is thought to have made 16 interventions on takeovers, nine of which were due to national security concerns. None of these deals have so far been blocked. \"Advent is committed to being a responsible steward of Cobham, encouraging its future growth and success. We will continue to engage constructively and cooperatively with the UK government in this part of their review,\" said an Advent spokesperson.  The defence technology firm has had a rocky time after issuing a series of profit warnings in 2016 and 2017, which required it to raise funds from its shareholders. Cobham has extensive contracts with the British military, including air-to-air plane refuelling, electronic warfare systems, and training military personnel to use software platforms in missile destroyers and fighter jets. Lady Nadine Cobham, 76, the widow of Sir Michael Cobham, who built up the firm over 25 years, recently spoke of her concerns about the takeover deal, telling the Mail on Sunday that Cobham \"deserves to be protected\" by the government. \"It's an opportune moment for Advent to pounce and the reality is that Advent will break up Cobham and sell off its parts to the highest bidder.  \"This may well include air-to-air refuelling, which is a real shocker,\" she said. She also said she would not accept Advent's assurances that it would maintain Cobham's UK and US headquarters, as well as investing further into the firm's research and development efforts. Successive governments have shown themselves to be intensely relaxed about foreign ownership of important bits of British infrastructure.  Our power and water supplies, ports and airports are all owned by overseas investors. That relaxed attitude has even extended to defence, particularly when the foreign owners are from allied countries.  Boeing, the US defence contractor, provides all kinds of kit, including Chinook helicopters, to the UK armed forces, while the new F-35 Lightning, the cutting edge of the Royal Air Force, is made by another American contractor, Lockheed Martin. That's why this morning's intervention by Andrea Leadsom has taken many by surprise. There was no groundswell of public opinion against the Advent bid for Cobham, despite the best efforts of the founding family to whip one up. A US buyer for a supplier of defence kit might be thought not to raise many issues of national security. But City sources pointed out this morning that silence should not have been mistaken for a lack of activity. Mrs Leadsom could not have intervened while the bid was still live - governments hate to affect commercial processes - but she was free to do so once Cobham shareholders approved the deal on Monday.  Meanwhile, defence experts say that Cobham's speciality, air-to-air refuelling, could well be seen as a matter of national security. It is impossible to fight a modern war without the ability to keep aircraft in the air for long periods of time.  When the Royal Air Force had to find a way to attack the Port Stanley airfield at short notice during the Falklands War, Cobham engineers made it possible.  Cobham is also the undisputed world leader in the field, something that gives UK industry a big entr\u00e9e to defence contracts round the world. Most think that in the end, the Advent deal will go through - but that the CMA investigation will result in legally binding undertakings that Cobham keep research and development capabilities here in the UK. Since 2002, the government is thought to have made 16 interventions on takeovers, nine of which were due to national security concerns.  In July, the government chose to intervene in another defence and aerospace industry deal - the \u00a32.7bn acquisition of satellite communications operator Inmarsat by a consortium of private equity funds. That probe is still ongoing. The move came after new laws were introduced in November, making it easier for the authorities to block takeover bids where there is a risk of technology being acquired by foreign firms.

            "text": "Irish airline Ryanair has placed an order for 75 more Boeing 737 Max aircraft as the plane is set to return to the skies after two fatal crashes. Ryanair had already agreed to buy 135 jets. The extra planes take the list value of the order to $22bn (\u00a316.3bn). The US Federal Aviation Administration recently certified the Boeing 737 Max for a return to service after it had been grounded since March 2019. Ryanair said it would take delivery of the planes early next year. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is yet to give the Boeing 737 Max the go-ahead to return to service.  EASA is in charge of re-certification for EU member states, as well as the UK. If Boeing wanted to appoint a new chief salesman, it should just call in Ryanair's boss Michael O'Leary. The 737 Max, he said, was a wonderful aircraft. A game-changer. More efficient than older planes. More environmentally friendly. Passengers would love it. Except he didn't call it the 737 Max. He repeatedly referred to the \"737 8200\". A sly rebranding exercise? Not according to Mr O'Leary. The plane was brilliant, and whatever you called it, passengers would want to fly on it. Boeing's more world-weary Dave Calhoun also insisted there was no rebranding going on.  And yet... his company was once heartily proud of the Max, and liked to flaunt the new name at every opportunity. Today, he was eager to downplay it as just another run-of-the-mill member of the 737 family. Boeing was forced to take the 737 Max out of service following two crashes within five months of each other, which together killed 346 people.  Its clearance to fly again comes after Boeing implemented a series of modifications including updating flight control software, revising crew procedures and rerouting internal wiring. At a news conference in Washington to announce the deal, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary described the 737 Max as \"a fabulous aircraft\". Boeing's chief executive, David Calhoun, said it was \"the beginning of the fulfilment of a more robust order book\".  Neither side disclosed the exact price that Ryanair will pay for the planes, but the airline will benefit from what the firms described as a \"modest\" discount on the cost. Mr Calhoun said Boeing did not expect to have to slash prices to bring back customers. \"We believe strongly in the recovery and therefore we will stay patient,\" Mr Calhoun said. \"We don't feel a need to discount our way into the marketplace.\" News of the deal was greeted with dismay by Naoise Ryan, of Cork in Ireland, whose husband Mick Ryan died when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 - a 737 Max - crashed in March 2019. \"Ryanair's purchase of the Max is an endorsement of Boeing's disregard of safety and human life. Like Boeing, they are prepared to gamble with people's lives in order to sell cheap flights on 'bargain-binned' planes,\" she said.  \"It is horrific that Boeing can once again profit from this dangerous plane while still hiding documents and have not been held to account for the deaths of 346 people. Boeing's attitude and dismissiveness should give everyone pause before ever boarding a Max.\"",

            "title": "Southampton Airport: BA launches summer European flights",
            "text": "British Airways has announced plans for flights from Southampton to destinations in six European countries. The carrier's BA CityFlyer subsidiary, will fly to holiday destinations including Ibiza, Mykonos and Malaga in Summer 2021. Southampton Airport lost 90% of its flights when airline Flybe collapsed earlier this year. The airport, which has submitted proposals to extend its runway, said it was \"fantastic news\". BA CityFlyer announced it would operate up to 17 flights each weekend to locations in Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece, France and Germany between 1 May and 31 October. There will also be a service to Edinburgh and the additional services will use BA CityFlyer's existing fleet of Embraer 190 aircraft. The airport's operations director Steve Szalay, said: \"The announcement from British Airways is fantastic news for Southampton Airport and the region during what has been the most challenging of years.\" The airport wants to extend the runway by 164m (538ft) to increase the number of flights and allow the use of larger planes. Mr Szalay previously said the airport's future would be in doubt if it was not allowed to extend the runway to accommodate planes such as the Airbus 320 and Boeing 737. Earlier this week Eastleigh Borough Council announced its planning decision on the proposals has been postponed until next year at the request of the airport. The plans have been opposed by local campaigners as well as Southampton City Council on the grounds of noise and climate change issues. Portsmouth City Council has also voted not to support the runway extension plans over environmental concerns,  according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. By Paul Clifton, BBC South transport correspondent This is a huge deal for this beleaguered south coast airport.  And it isn't just cherry picking routes vacated when Flybe collapsed at the start of this year, which took away 90% of Southampton's passengers. Direct flights to Berlin, Florence and Mykonos really are new. And a service to Edinburgh is head-to-head competition for existing flights.  The airport is desperately trying to convince the local council that it should be allowed to extend the runway to take larger, heavier, noisier planes for popular holiday routes to European destinations. The extra tarmac, it argues, is make-or-break for the airport's survival.  For Eastleigh Borough Council that is a tough call. It has declared a climate emergency and more polluting planes will not sit comfortably on the consciences of some councillors.  But here comes British Airways, selling flights to the summer sun on smaller aircraft that are not dependent on that council decision. ",

            "title": "Why did the Airbus A380 fail?",
            "text": "When Singapore Airlines took the A380 superjumbo for its first commercial flight in 2007, there was widespread applause that the future of air travel had arrived. But the Airbus programme, long-delayed and over-budget, never really shook off predictions that it would be a white elephant of the skies. So why did the world's largest passenger aircraft, described as a \"hotel in the sky\", fail after just 12 years of production? The A380, whose wings are made at Airbus UK, was a bold challenger to US rival Boeing's dominance of the large aircraft market.  While Airbus was taking a multi-billion-dollar bet that airlines would want big aircraft in the future, Boeing was developing its smaller, nimbler (and seemingly more successful) 787 Dreamliner. Carrying about 550 passengers - but with capacity for more - over a range of 8,000 nautical miles, the A380 was pitched at the fast-growing Asia and Middle East markets, where airlines were keen to fly more people per flight. The A380 also boasted more than 500 sq m of usable floor space, enabling carriers to offer plush first-class suites, as well as bars, beauty salons and duty-free shops. But after an initial surge of orders, especially from Dubai-based Emirates, demand dried up and the programme has never turned a profit. The whole programme is thought to have cost $25bn (\u00a319.4bn) and has been dogged by controversies over subsidies from the French and German governments. Last year, the World Trade Organisation ruled that the EU failed to comply with requests to end state aid to the planemaker, ramping up trade tensions between the bloc and the US. As of January, Airbus had received 313 firm orders for the passenger version of the plane, of which 234 had been delivered.  Its target was to sell 700 in total.  Ironically, the double-decker planes are popular with passengers, but airlines have come to view them as inefficient. Some argue that the A380 is too large, making it unprofitable when too many seats go unfilled. And Willie Walsh, boss of British Airways-owner IAG, just last week suggested that the plane - while good - was too pricey. With fuel prices rising and campaigners questioning the environmental impact of aircraft, some airlines chose to opt for smaller, but more efficient, planes produced by both Boeing and Airbus.  Some airlines preferred to wait for more details about Boeing's new family of 777s - deliveries of which start in 2020 - which has fewer seats but the same range, more payload, and two fewer engines. Since 2005, a total of 57 firm orders for the A380 have been cancelled by airlines including Emirates, Virgin Atlantic and Lufthansa. A cargo version of the plane also never took off because of a lack of interest.  Not surprisingly, speculation that the aircraft could be scrapped has swirled for years, although Airbus could have continued to produce the A380 in limited numbers, experts say.  However, a decision by its biggest customer, Emirates, to downgrade an order appears to have forced Airbus's hand. ",

            "title": "Boeing 737 Max: What went wrong?",
            "text": "Pilots of the crashed Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max were unable to prevent the plane repeatedly nosediving despite following procedures, an initial report has found.  The captain and first officer followed safety procedures recommended by Boeing. But they couldn't stop the aircraft going into a fatal dive shortly after take off from Addis Ababa on 10 March, the report by Ethiopian investigators said. All 157 people on board were killed. Aviation authorities grounded the entire global fleet of 737 Max aircraft in March after two fatal crashes in five months. The Ethiopian Airlines crash followed a Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October, which left 189 dead. Flight ET302 took off from Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa at 08:38 local time (05:38 GMT) on 10 March for a two-hour flight to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. Six minutes later, at 08:44, it crashed 30 miles southeast of the airport, near the town of Bishoftu. The impact was so great, both engines were buried at a depth of 10m (32ft), in a crater 28m wide and 40m long. The preliminary report into the accident, by Ethiopia's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, said the plane's take-off appeared normal. However, a short time later two sensors that measured the angle of the plane's flight began to record different readings. This triggered an automated safety system which repeatedly pushed the nose of the plane down - something that was also recorded during the fatal Lion Air flight. The Ethiopian authorities' report suggests the pilots followed steps to disengage the system, but even after manually trying to steady the plane, the system pushed the nose down until the aircraft crashed. The report did not attribute blame for the crash, but a detailed timeline suggests the pilots were struggling to deal with an automated safety system - known as the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). The system is designed to prevent the plane stalling when making steep turns under manual control. A stall can happen when the plane flies at too steep an angle. This can reduce the lift generated by the wings, potentially making the plane drop. To recover from a stall, a pilot would normally push the plane's nose down.  In the 737 Max, MCAS does this automatically, moving the aircraft back to a \"normal\" flight position. The system then repeats the process if it detects the plane is still tilted at too great an angle.  However, after the Lion Air crash, it was found the aircraft had experienced problems with a sensor which calculates the angle of flight, or \"angle of attack\". If this sensor gives a false reading, MCAS may activate and push the nose down when nothing is wrong.  Although the Ethiopian authorities' report does not mention MCAS by name, it does suggest the pilots were struggling to control the aircraft's angle of flight and says one of the sensors was giving erroneous readings. Source: Ethiopia's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau Dagmawit Moges, Ethiopia's transport minister, said that the flight crew repeatedly followed procedures recommended by the plane's manufacturer but \"were not able to control the aircraft\". In a statement, the chief executive of Ethiopian Airlines, Tewolde GebreMariam, said he was \"very proud\" of the pilots' \"high level of professional performance\". \"It was very unfortunate they could not recover the airplane from the persistence of nosediving,\" the airline said in a statement. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg acknowledged that an \"erroneous activation\" of MCAS had occurred in both recent crashes.  But the company was \"confident in the fundamental safety of the 737 MAX\", he said, adding that impending software fixes would make the aircraft \"among the safest airplanes ever to fly.\" A final report by Ethiopian authorities, aided by air-safety experts from the US and Europe, is due to be published within a year. Investigators have pointed to similarities in flight data transmitted by the two 737 Max planes that crashed in Ethiopia and Indonesia. Vertical speed readings, which show how fast a plane is going up and down, were erratic and suggest that both sets of pilots were struggling to maintain a steady ascent after take-off. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which is investigating the crash alongside the Ethiopian National Transportation Safety Board, has said evidence collected at the site and satellite data showed the two flights behaved \"very similarly\". \"The evidence we found on the ground made it even more likely the flight path was very close to Lion Air's,\" said Dan Elwell, acting administrator at the FAA. This ground evidence is reported to be a piece of wreckage from the tail section which indicates that the horizontal stabiliser was set to point the aircraft nose downwards.  The black box flight recorders - the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder - from the aircraft are being examined by investigators in Paris. After the Lion Air crash, Boeing issued guidance to pilots on how to manage MCAS, but a software fix to remedy the problem has been repeatedly delayed.  US regulators and safety experts are now asking how thoroughly the FAA and Boeing vetted the anti-stall system and how well pilots around the world were trained for it when their airlines bought new planes. A warning light which could have alerted pilots to a problem with the flight sensors was not fitted to either of the planes that crashed.   Boeing simulator tests have also found that MCAS behaved much more powerfully than expected, repeatedly forcing the aircraft nose down.  In a simulation of the Lion Air flight, test pilots found they had less than 40 seconds to overcome the problem before the plane went into a unrecoverable nose-dive, the New York Times reported. It is the latest in the company's successful 737 line. The group includes the Max 7, 8, 9 and 10 models. The aircraft is the fastest-selling in Boeing's history. More than 4,500 have been ordered by 100 different operators globally. By the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 of the Max 8 models. They have been in commercial use since 2017. The Max 8 that crashed in March was one of 30 ordered as part of Ethiopian Airlines' expansion. It underwent a \"rigorous first check maintenance\" on 4 February, the airline said. A small number of Boeing's Max 9s are also operating. The Max 7 and 10 models, not yet delivered, are due for roll-out in the next few years. The Boeing 737 first flew in 1967 and was designed as a short-range narrow body airliner.  There have been more than a dozen subsequent models and it remains the best-selling commercial aircraft ever made, with some 10,000 produced.",

            "text": "A teenager who was brought up in London was among the 176 people killed when a Ukrainian passenger jet crashed in Iran, it has emerged.  Arad Zarei, 17, who relocated to Canada after attending St Mary's Primary School in Twickenham until 2014, was said to be visiting his mother. The prime minister said four Britons are known to have died in the crash. The Foreign Office has hardened its advice to warn Britons against all travel to, from and within Iran. A spokesman for Arad Zarei's former school said staff and governors were \"shocked and immensely saddened\" to hear of his death in the plane crash. \"Arad attended St Mary's until 2014 and is remembered fondly by his teachers. \"We wish to extend our prayers and condolences to Arad's family and friends at this time.\" The crash on Wednesday came just hours after Iran carried out missile strikes on two airbases housing US forces in Iraq. The air strikes were in retaliation for the US killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. Western leaders, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson, have said evidence suggested the plane was hit by a surface-to-air missile, possibly in error - something Iran denies.  Echoing comments by Mr Johnson, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called for a thorough investigation, saying Iran should \"open up\" the crash site to international investigators, adding that grieving families deserved the \"truth\". Also on board the flight from Tehran were 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians, 10 Swedes, four Afghans and three Germans. The names of three Britons who died in the crash have been released so far. Mohammed Reza Kadkhoda Zadeh, 40, who ran a neighbourhood dry cleaners in Hassocks, West Sussex, had a nine-year-old daughter. BP engineer Sam Zokaei, 42, from Twickenham, and PhD student Saeed Tahmasebi, 35, who worked as an engineer for Laing O'Rourke in Dartford, were also killed. Last year, Mr Tahmasebi - whose full name was Saeed Tahmasebi Khademasadi - married his Iranian partner, Niloufar Ebrahim, who was also listed as a passenger on the plane. Meanwhile, concerns have been raised for Britons detained in Iran, amid the growing tensions.  Richard Ratcliffe, husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a charity worker from London who has been detained for more than three years over spying allegations she denies, held a meeting with Foreign Office officials on Friday.  He told the BBC the prime minister raised the cases of detained Britons when he spoke to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Thursday. \"This is a situation where there is a lot of anger in Iran and a lot of vulnerability, and it's very stressful for the people involved,\" he added. \"Nazanin was taken down to the clinic overnight two nights ago, through palpitations and panic attacks. \"So I think it's important for the government to just do what they can.\" The wife of Anoosheh Ashoori, a British-Iranian dual national who has been in jail for more than two years over espionage charges which he denies, called on the UK government to do more to protect her husband.  Sherry Izadi said she was worried there could be a backlash against foreign prisoners.",

            "text": "Passengers from 35 countries were on board the Ethiopian Airlines flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi that crashed on 10 March, killing 157 people.  Among the victims were 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians and eight Americans. UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the crash as a \"global tragedy\". A large number of passengers were affiliated with the UN or had been on their way to an environment conference in Nairobi. A former Kenyan football administrator, a \"stellar\" US student and a Slovakian MP's family all died in the crash. One Kenyan man lost his wife, daughter and three grandchildren, while a Canadian family of six also died on flight ET302. One of the youngest passengers was just nine months old. Here is what is known about some of the victims. Senior Capt Yared Mulugeta Gatechew, of Kenyan and Ethiopian heritage, was the flight's main pilot. He had been working for Ethiopian Airlines since November 2007 with the company saying he had a \"commendable performance\" with more than 8,000 hours in the air. Hassan Katende, a friend, said he learned of the crash on social media and that his \"hair just stood up\" when he heard that he had died. \"I can't sleep. It's shocking. It's very hard to believe. It's really unbelievable,\" he told BBC Amharic. Among the victims was Cedric Asiavugwa, a third-year law student at Georgetown University in Washington DC. He was reportedly travelling to Nairobi to attend the funeral of one of his relatives. \"With his passing, the Georgetown family has lost a stellar student, a great friend to many, and a dedicated champion for social justice across East Africa and the world,\" Georgetown Law Dean William Treanor said. Mr Asiavugwa was committed to issues of social justice, especially for refugees and other marginalised groups, the university said. He also carried out research on subjects ranging from peace to food security in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and South Sudan. Hussein Swaleh, a former Kenyan football administrator, also died in the crash, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) said. The head of Kenya's football federation tweeted that it was a \"sad day for football\". Mr Swaleh was reportedly returning home after officiating in a CAF Champions League match in Alexandria, Egypt. Former Kenyan journalist Anthony Ngare, 49, was deputy director of communications for the UN's cultural agency, Unesco, and had just represented Kenya at a UN conference in Paris. The Kenya National Commission for Unesco described Mr Ngare as \"one of its shining stars\". He was formerly an editor at local media house Standard Group and had also worked at a government agency. Retired top military officer George Kabugi had 37 years of military experience, having joined the Kenya Army in 1979. Dr Mumo Nzau, a friend, described Mr Kabugi as highly motivated and a true Kenyan patriot. John Quindos Karanja lost his wife Ann Wangui Quindos Karanja, his daughter Caroline and her children, seven-year-old Ryan Njoroge, five-year-old Kelly Paul and nine-month-old Ruby Paul. Ann Wangui had been living in Canada for a year, helping her daughter with the small children and the new baby.  Nigerian-born Canadian Prof Pius Adesanmi was the director of Carleton University's Institute of African Studies. His contributions were \"immeasurable,\" said Pauline Rankin, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.  \"He worked tirelessly to build the Institute of African Studies, to share his boundless passion for African literature and to connect with and support students. He was a scholar and teacher of the highest calibre who leaves a deep imprint on Carleton.\" Benoit-Antoine Bacon, president and vice-chancellor of Global Affairs Canada, said: \"Pius Adesanmi was a towering figure in African and post-colonial scholarship and his sudden loss is a tragedy.\" Canadian-Somali Amina Ibrahim Odowa and her five-year-old daughter, Sofia Abdulkadir, were also among the victims. They had been travelling to Kenya from their home in Edmonton for her wedding. \"Her fianc\u00e9 hasn't even had water since the news broke. He hasn't eaten anything. He's in bad shape. Our elder sister is also in shock. We aren't ok. We hope to at least see her body,\" her brother told the BBC. She leaves behind two other young daughters, who are said to being cared for by their grandmother. Environmentalist Peter DeMarsh was on his way to a conference in Nairobi, his sister Helen said on Facebook. \"Praying for him as we remember his brilliance, devotion to humanity and the wellbeing of the planet.\" Mr DeMarsh had moved back home to New Brunswick to be close to his elderly mother, his sister said. He leaves behind a wife and a son.  Derick Lwugi, 54, was an accountant and pastor from Calgary, CBC News reports. He was described as a \"pillar\" of the local Kenyan community. He leaves behind his wife, who is a domestic abuse councillor, and three children aged 17, 19 and 20. A family of six were among the Canadian victims - Kosha Vaidya, 37, and her husband Prerit Dixit, 45, were taking their 14-year-old daughter Ashka and 13-year-old daughter Anushka to Nairobi, where Kosha was born.  Relatives told Canadian media that the family of Indian origin had only planned the trip 10 days before. Kosha's parents, Pannagesh Vaidya, 73, and Hansini Vaidya, 67, decided to join them as it had been 35 years since the couple had been in Kenya. Danielle Moore, 24, was travelling to a UN environment conference in Nairobi. On 9 March, she posted a message on Facebook: \"I'm so excited to share that I've been selected to attend and am currently en route to the United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya with United Nations Association In Canada and #CanadaServiceCorps / #LeadersToday!  \"Over the next week I'll have the opportunity to discuss global environmental issues, share stories, and connect with other youth and leaders from all over the world. I feel beyond privileged to be receiving this opportunity, and want to share as much with folks back home.\" Ms Moore studied marine biology at Dalhousie University and later at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences in 2015. She was working both as a member of the clean ocean advocacy group Ocean Wise and as an education lead at the charity Canada Learning Code. Dawn Tanner, 47, a special education teacher from Hamilton, was also on the flight. The Grand Erie District School Board issued a statement confirming her death and paying tribute to her work. Her son, Cody French, described her as an \"extraordinary woman\". Angela Rehhorn, 24, was one of the many environmentalists on board the flight.

A London Stansted spokeswoman said the Kenya Airways Boeing 787 \"landed safely with Essex Police in attendance\". \"The aircraft was escorted to a remote parking stand with normal flight operations now continuing,\" she said. The plane was diverted to Stansted just before 15:45 BST but Essex Police said the incident had now been \"stood down\".  Officers said inquiries established there was nothing of concern and they handed the plane back to the airport.

            "text": "An Indonesian airliner has crashed into the sea with 189 people on board. The Boeing 737, owned by the low-cost airline Lion Air, went down after taking off from the capital Jakarta.  Flight JT 610 was headed for the western city of Pangkal Pinang. Rescuers have recovered some bodies and personal items, including baby shoes.  There is no sign of survivors. The cause of the crash, which involved a plane that had been in operation since August, remains unclear.  The incident is reported to be the first major accident involving a Boeing 737 Max - an updated version of the 737. \"We need to find the main wreckage,\" said Bambang Suryo, operational director of the search and rescue agency. \"I predict there are no survivors, based on body parts found so far.\" Families are being told to go to a hospital to identify the dead. Flight JT 610 took off from Jakarta at 06:20 on Monday (23:30 GMT on Sunday).  It was due to arrive at Depati Amir airport in Pangkal Pinang an hour later but 13 minutes into the flight, authorities lost contact. The pilot had asked to return to Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta airport, officials say.  Lion Air Chief Executive Edward Sirait said the plane had an unspecified \"technical issue\" on a previous flight, but he said that this had been \"resolved\". The airline operates 11 Boeing 737 Max 8 planes but the others have not had a similar technical problem and there is no plan to ground the fleet, he added. The head of Indonesia's disaster agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, has tweeted images of debris and personal belongings that came from the aircraft and had been found floating in the sea.  by Rebecca Henschke, BBC Indonesia correspondent, Jakarta Relatives of those on board are waiting anxiously for any news at a crisis centre at Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusuma airport, their faces stained with tears. At a desk under a white tent, Lion Air staff are taking down their details. At the top of the forms, they are asked to specify their relationship to the missing - husband, mother, child. Murtado Kurniawan's wife was on the plane. They are newly married and she was making the journey for work.  \"I can't live without her, I love her,\" he says through tears. \"The last thing I said to her, was 'be careful'. I always worry about her when she goes away. When I saw on TV that the plane had crashed, my whole body went weak.\" Dede dropped her niece Fiona Ayu and her family off at the airport on Monday morning, to make the short journey home. Fiona is trying to get pregnant via IVF and her family thought it would be good for her to get some rest. \"The airline kept telling us to wait and wait for news, but the images on social media and television are very bad,\" Dede says. \"But I am still holding out hope that she will come back, I am praying and praying for that.\" Lion Air said in a statement that the pilot and co-pilot had more than 11,000 flight hours between them. Three of the crew on board were trainee flight attendants and one was a technician. Twenty employees from Indonesia's finance ministry were also on board, the BBC has learned. A ministry spokesperson said they worked at the finance ministry offices in Pangkal Pinang but had been in Jakarta for the weekend. The 737 Max series are the fastest-selling planes in Boeing history, and there are four models - the Max 7, Max 8, Max 9 and Max 10. The Boeing 737 Max 8 has been in commercial use since 2016.  The aircraft involved in the crash was made in 2018. It is a single aisle plane used for short-haul travel. In a statement, Boeing expressed sympathy for the victims and families and said it \"stands ready to provide technical assistance to the accident investigation\". Australia told government workers and contractors to stop using the airline until the findings of the investigation were out. Indonesia, a vast archipelago, is heavily reliant on air travel, but many of its airlines have a poor safety record.  Established in 1999, Lion Air operates domestic flights as well as international routes to South East Asia, Australia and the Middle East. It has had issues of safety and poor management in the past and was banned from flying into European airspace until 2016. In 2013, Lion Air flight 904 crashed into the sea on landing at Bali's International Airport. All 108 people on board survived. In 2004, flight 538 from Jakarta crashed and broke up on landing at Solo City, killing 25 people. In 2011 and 2012 a number of pilots were found in possession of methamphetamines, in one incident hours before a flight.",

            "title": "What do the 737 Max crashes mean for Boeing?",
            "text": "Boeing, a superpower of the aviation world, is in the midst of a profound crisis.  A brand new 737-Max 8 crashing after a new system on the modified aircraft apparently malfunctioned is, if investigators initial findings are confirmed, a disaster.  All the evidence is pointing towards a second case of the same model of plane apparently suffering a similar fate, just five months later, and that makes this a whole lot worse.  While the investigations into the crash are not yet complete, the problems for Boeing are mounting.  The new anti-stall mechanism on the Max relied on data from one single sensor at the front of the aircraft.  It's believed that erroneous data from that single sensor activated an anti stall system on the Lion Air flight, pushing the nose of the plane down shortly after take-off.  The evidence suggests that could also be the case for Ethiopian Airlines flight 302.  The automatic system was also designed to reactivate repeatedly, so when the pilots on Lionair flight 610 pulled the nose of the plane back up, the stall mechanism kicked-in again, pushing the nose of each aircraft back down.  Flight ET 302 also nose-dived repeatedly and, according to the preliminary report into the crash, the pilots followed Boeing's procedures and that was not enough to regain control of the aircraft.  For Capt Brady, author of the 'Boeing 737 technical guide', this saga presents a long list of issues which need to be looked at. \"The level of automation of the aircraft, the behind the scenes systems, the risk analysis processes gone through at Boeing, the oversight by the regulator, the conversion training, the level of training generally, the manual flying skills of the crews. All of it needs to be reviewed in light of these accidents,\" he says. Multiple inquiries are underway. At least two lawsuits have been filed and more are likely.  The latest of those two lawsuits has been filed by Ralph Nader.  His niece's daughter, 24 year old Samya Stumo, who was working in the global health sector was one of 157 people killed on board flight ET 302.  \"She had leadership written all over her, she had compassion in an intellectually rigorous way.\" \"She was driven to save lives and we'll never know how many lives have been lost because she's not helping in a systemic way for the next 50 years.\" Mr Nader ran several times for the US presidency, he's an experienced lawyer and has form at taking on big companies and is threatening to take legal action against Boeing. Last week a suit was filed in a Chicago federal court by the family of one of the victims of the Ethiopian crash, Jackson Musoni, a citizen of Rwanda. It alleges that Boeing had defectively designed the automated flight control system. Multiple investigations will pore over the certification of the Max and its new anti-stall system.  According to one former test pilot at Boeing there were thousands of hours of flight time during the test programme which went on for more than a year.  He says there will be \"terabytes of data\" from test flights which can now be examined. \"Nothing is done by a rogue pilot\", the former Boeing employee said.  \"If anything we overkill, when going over things in group discussions.\" Boeing says it will install an extra warning system in the 737 Max 8 and is revising the company's pilot training plans. But the sign-off process this time around will be more rigorous and aviation regulators from outside the US will be much more active in the process. The protocol of other regulators accepting the Federal Aviation Administration's judgement will not necessarily apply.   Europe's Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, will, on this occasion, make up its own mind before the Max is deemed safe enough to fly again through European skies.  With hundreds of 737-Maxs grounded worldwide and thousands of orders now on ice, with some of those possibly in jeopardy, the commercial impact of this episode is still evolving.  Airlines whose aircraft remain grounded will want financial compensation.  The potential bill for Boeing will grow exponentially if this drags into the summer months, when flight schedules and therefore cost implications suddenly increase.  That said, Boeing is a commercial giant.  \"Boeing has a large enough balance sheet. It won't really hit them\", says Peter Lemme, a former flight engineer at Boeing.  But he believes Boeing's reputation \"is tarnished by this.\" In his opinion, getting the Max back in the air won't be straight forward.  \"There's a little bit of uncertainty now over what it will take to satisfy the regulators.\" And in the world of aviation, everything comes down to safety.  For Capt Chris Brady, an experienced 737 pilot, this is a watershed moment.  \"It's the processes which are flawed,\" he says. \"It could apply to any manufacturer anywhere and I'm quite sure Airbus will be looking at their own processes in light of this and asking, could this happen to us?\" Boeing has insisted that safety has always been its number one priority.

            "text": "The world's largest commercial passenger aircraft has landed in Glasgow, signalling the start of regular services to and from Dubai. The Airbus A380 touched down at Glasgow Airport at 19:45 on Tuesday, after more than \u00a38m was spent to prepare for its arrival. Also known as the superjumbo, the double-decker jet, was welcomed by scores of onlookers. A piper was playing on the tarmac to welcome the plane.  The Airbus first paid Glasgow a visit five years ago, marking 10 years of flights from the city by the Emirates airline. Since then the airport has made significant changes to accommodate regular flights, including alterations to the airfield layout and the building of Scotland's only triple air bridge. It has been designed to get hundreds of passengers on and off the giant as quickly and safely as possible. After Tuesday's landing, the superjumbo will be seen flying to and from Glasgow on a daily basis. In recent years Emirates have scheduled twice-a-day services by Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. But engineering works at the airline's Dubai hub are closing one of its runways and reducing the number of possible aircraft movements. So, for the time being, a single A380 flight will replace the two current Glasgow services. The A380, which costs $400m on average,  has a maximum takeoff weight of 575 tonnes - the same as about 45 double-decker buses. It can carry about 550 passengers - but with capacity for more - over a range of 8,000 nautical miles.",

            "text": "The European Union may impose new border taxes on up to $4bn (\u00a33.08bn) in US goods annually as punishment for subsidies provided to Boeing, the World Trade Organization has ruled.  The decision is the latest step in a long-running feud between the US and EU over state subsidies for Boeing and EU rival Airbus. Last year, the WTO cleared the US to impose tariffs on $7.5bn in EU items. But the US said the EU should not move forward with tariffs of its own. America's top trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer said the US had removed the offending subsidies for Boeing, tax breaks granted by the state of Washington, earlier this year. The EU says the same is true of US tariffs imposed against subsidies to the A380 plane which is being taken out of production. \"Because Washington State repealed that tax break earlier this year, the EU has no valid basis to retaliate against any US products,\" Mr Lighthizer said. \"Any imposition of tariffs based on a measure that has been eliminated is plainly contrary to WTO principles and will force a US response.\" On Twitter, EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said the EU would \"immediately re-engage with the US\" and strongly preferred a \"negotiated settlement\". European officials have been pushing the US to remove the taxes the US imposed on European goods following the WTO ruling last year. \"Otherwise, we will be forced to defend our interests and respond in a proportionate way\", Mr Dombrovskis added. The EU first lodged its complaint with the WTO in 2005, following a similar filing by the US over EU support for Airbus.  WTO panels have found both sides at fault and authorised the US to retaliate last year, leading to new US duties of 15%-25% on European items such as aircraft, French cheese and Scotch whiskey.  The EU, which drew up a list of potential American targets for tariffs last year that included handbags and ketchup, had been awaiting a final decision from the WTO about how much of a punishment it could impose. It must formally request authorisation from the WTO before moving forward with the duties. The two sides have said they are trying to reach a settlement that would remove the border taxes, which hurt trade by making goods more expensive. Both the EU and US now maintain they are in compliance with WTO rules.  In a statement, Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury said the firm wanted the two sides to settle the fight and remove tariffs. \"Airbus did not start this WTO dispute, and we do not wish to continue the harm to the customers and suppliers of the aviation industry and to all other sectors impacted,\" he said. \"It is time to find a solution now so that tariffs can be removed on both sides of the Atlantic.\"",

            "text": "The deadly bombing of an Air India flight in 1985 is back in the news after relations between India and Canada hit a new low. Last week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country was investigating \"credible allegations\" that could link the Indian government to the murder of a Sikh separatist leader in British Columbia. India has denied the allegations, calling them \"absurd\". Since then, several commentators in India have brought up the 1985 attack - also known as the \"Kanishka bombing\" because the Boeing 747 was named after the Emperor Kanishka - which also strained Delhi-Ottawa ties. On 23 June 1985, an Air India flight travelling from Canada to India via London, exploded off the Irish coast, killing all 329 people on board. The cause was a bomb in a suitcase that was transferred to the flight even though the ticket holder had not boarded. The victims included 268 Canadian citizens, mostly of Indian origin, and 24 Indians. Only 131 bodies were retrieved from the sea. While the flight was still in the air, another explosion at Tokyo's Narita airport killed two Japanese baggage handlers. Investigators later said that this bomb was linked to the attack on Flight 182 and intended for another Air India flight to Bangkok but it exploded prematurely. Canadian investigators have alleged that the bombings were planned by Sikh separatists who wanted to take revenge for the Indian army's deadly 1984 storming of the Golden Temple in Punjab state.  A few months after the attack, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) arrested Talwinder Singh Parmar - the leader of an extremist group called Babbar Khalsa that is now banned in Canada and India - and Inderjit Singh Reyat, an electrician, on various weapons, explosives and conspiracy charges.  But the case against Parmar - whom India had unsuccessfully tried to get extradited from Canada in the early 1980s - was flimsy and he was released. Investigators now believe that Parmar - who was killed by police in India in 1992 - was the mastermind behind the attack.  In 2000, police arrested Ripudaman Singh Malik, a wealthy Vancouver businessman, and Ajaib Singh Bagri, a mill worker from British Columbia, on a number of charges including mass murder and conspiracy.  But in 2005, after an expensive trial that lasted almost two years, both men were acquitted of all charges - the judge said there were factual errors and credibility issues with key witnesses who testified against the men. The BBC reported at the time that the verdict was greeted with shock, with victims' relatives sobbing in the courtroom. Reyat was the only person to be convicted in connection with one of the world's worst aviation terror attacks. He was jailed in the UK for 10 years in 1991 for his involvement in the Japan bombing. In 2003, he pleaded guilty in a Canadian court to manslaughter in connection with the bombing of Flight 182, and was sentenced to another five years in prison. He was also later convicted of perjury at the trial of Malik and Bagri, and given an additional jail sentence. Canadian authorities have been accused of not doing enough to prevent the attack and of bungling the investigation. After outrage from victims' families over the acquittal of Malik and Bagri, the Canadian government set up a public inquiry in 2006, headed by a former Supreme Court judge, to look into the bombing. It concluded in 2010 that a \"cascading series of errors\" had led to the \"largest mass murder in Canadian history\".  The inquiry heard that an unidentified witness had warned Canadian police of a plot to blow up a plane months before the attack.  It also emerged that in the weeks before the attack, members of the Canadian secret services had followed Parmar and Reyat to some woods on Vancouver Island where they heard \"a loud explosive sound\", but did not regard this as important.  In the 1990s, two Sikh journalists who may have been key prosecution witnesses, were murdered in separate incidents in London and Canada - one of them was already in a wheelchair after an earlier shooting. In 2000, a former Canadian secret services officer told a newspaper that he destroyed tapes with 150 hours of telephone calls made by Sikh suspects instead of handing them over to the RCMP as he feared it could reveal the identity of the informants.  In 2010, after the inquiry report was released, then Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper offered a public apology to the families of the victims - he said their \"legitimate need for answers and indeed, for empathy, were treated with administrative disdain\" for years. In 2016, Reyat was released from a Canadian prison after serving two-thirds of a nine-year sentence - the next year, he was also allowed to leave a halfway house and live where he wanted to, a decision some experts criticised.  Last year, Ripudaman Singh Malik was shot dead in his car in Surrey, British Columbia in what police described as a targeted killing - they arrested two men on charges of first-degree murder. Their motive isn't clear.  A study released by the Angus Reid Institute earlier this year around the 38th anniversary of the Air India bombing found that the tragedy is still \"a relatively unknown piece of Canadian history\" - they found that nine in 10 Canadians have little or no knowledge of the attack.  The Air India bombings have long evoked painful memories in India - while the majority of the victims were Canadian citizens, most of them were of Indian origin and had relatives in the country. The overwhelming sentiment in India is that justice has not been delivered to the victims. In 2006, Canadian lawyer Richard Quance travelled to India to meet some of the relatives of the victims - he told the BBC that the families in India felt \"excluded from the judicial process\" and had questions about the process that led to the acquittals of Malik and Bagri. Indian families left bereft by the bombing felt \"neglected and left out\", Amarjit Bhinder, whose husband was the co-pilot on the Air India flight, told the BBC at the time. The recent row between the countries has also brought the tragedy back into discussion in India - a federal minister recently tweeted about it, calling the bombing \"one of the most reprehensible acts of aviation terror against India\" and criticising the \"mindsets that tolerated & even condoned\" the act. Several news stories and opinion pieces have also remarked on the missteps by Canadian authorities in the run-up to and after the bombings. Over the years, families of those who died have spoken of their anguish. \"I still meet people today who were somehow connected with the Air India bombing - my kindergarten daughter's teacher was a schoolmate of a victim. It is surprising how widely the bombing affected Canadians,\" says Susheel Gupta, who was 12 when his mother died. BBC News India is now on YouTube.

            "text": "EasyJet customers who want to use overhead luggage lockers will have to buy more expensive tickets. In a move which provoked criticism on social media, EasyJet said the changes to its luggage policy will start on 10 February. Customers who don't buy the more expensive tickets will be restricted to putting a small carry-on bag under their seat. EasyJet said the changes would improve punctuality. But some customers reacted with dismay on Twitter, with one calling it an \"absolutely terrible move\". \"Like Ryanair, [they are] monetising every opportunity in a race to the bottom,\" they said.    Another accused the airline of changing the conditions of their ticket after they had bought it.  \"I imagine there is some small letter in the terms to allow you to do it, but it is not right is it?\" But some customers welcomed the move, saying it would free up storage space. Currently, all customers are allowed to fly with a cabin bag measuring up to 56 x 45 x 25cm, enabling them to put small wheelie suitcases into overhead lockers. But under the new rules, passengers who want to travel with an additional bag of this size as hand luggage must buy a more expensive ticket such as an Up Front or Extra Legroom seat. Prices range from \u00a37.99 more expensive than a standard fare, up to \u00a329.99 on longer flights. People who also buy a more expensive Flexi fare or are members of the carrier's frequent flyer scheme will also continue to be allowed to take one small and one large item of hand luggage with them, subject to space on board. EasyJet customers with an existing booking for travel from February 10 who do not want to pay more will be able to check in a larger cabin bag in the aircraft hold free of charge. Robert Carey, chief commercial and customer officer for EasyJet said: \"Punctuality is important to our customers and we know that if they have their bags placed into the hold at the gate due to the limited space onboard this can cause flight delays, and it can be frustrating for them too. \"Our new policy will improve boarding and punctuality for everyone, as well as give our customers certainty of what they will have with them onboard.\" EasyJet previously used its luggage allowance to differentiate it from competitors. Ryanair limits passengers to one small item of hand luggage without an extra fee, while British Airways' cheapest fares include one large and one small item of hand luggage. Airlines have been hit hard by coronavirus crisis travel restrictions, and have been looking for ways to cut costs. In November, EasyJet reported its first annual loss in the airline's 25-year history. The airline made a loss of \u00a31.27bn for the year to 30 September as revenues more than halved. EasyJet expects to fly at just 20% of normal capacity into next year. A spokesperson said the change in baggage allowance had been under consideration since before the pandemic.",

            "text": "Boeing kicked off the first day of the Dubai Airshow by announcing the first big sales news of the five-day event. Emirates has ordered 40 Boeing 787 Dreamliners in a deal worth about $15bn (\u00a311.3bn) at list prices. The Dubai airline's chairman, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, said the aircraft had been chosen over the Airbus A350. He had been expected to announce a big order for the Airbus A380 superjumbo at the media briefing. Airbus desperately needs more orders for the A380, the biggest passenger aircraft in the skies.  The Franco-German company and Emirates were understood to be in intense final negotiations to have an announcement ready for this week's show. Emirates, the largest airline in the Middle East, is already the biggest customer for Boeing's 777, with 165 in service and another 164 on order. Sheikh Ahmed said Sunday's order raises the cost of its purchase of Boeing aircraft to $90bn. Some of the new 787s will be used to replace older planes, while others will be used to expand the airline's network. Boeing welcomed the deal, which Kevin McAllister, head of its commercial aviation division, said would sustain many jobs in the United States. Deliveries of the aircraft are scheduled to start in 2022. Also on Sunday, Azerbaijan Airlines said it was buying five Dreamliners, as well as two Boeing freighters, in a deal worth an estimated $2bn. Amid the display of military hardware and the latest civil aircraft, it is the traditional rivalry of Boeing and Airbus that grabs the airshow headlines. So far this year, Boeing has won about 65% of the new orders placed for aircraft globally.  Neither Emirates nor Airbus would comment on the status of the rumoured A380 order, which would help protect jobs at the aircraft manufacturer's plant in north Wales, where the wings are made.  Emirates has been the biggest customer for the A380, having bought 142 of the almost 320 that are in service or on the production line. The last order for the superjumbo came two years ago, when Japan's ANA purchased just three planes. In July Airbus said it would again cut annual production of the A380 from 12 to eight. Two years ago Airbus was making 28 planes a year. ",

            "text": "Struggling airline Norwegian Air faces a battle for survival after the Norwegian government said it would not provide further backing. Extra loan guarantees would be too \"risky\" and \"not defensible\", the country's government said. The airline said it faced a \"very uncertain future\" with \"ventilator support\" needed to survive the winter. Norwegian Air said in August it would run out of money in the first quarter of 2021 without extra cash. The airline, which like the rest of the sector has been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis and has grounded most of its fleet, has been holding talks with the government to try to gain more backing. \"The fact that our government has decided to refrain from providing Norwegian with further financial support is very disappointing and feels like a slap in the face for everybody at Norwegian who is fighting for the company when our competitors are receiving billions in funding from their respective governments,\" said chief executive Jacob Schram. \"The company and the board will turn every stone to get through this situation,\" Mr Schram told a news conference, noting that Norwegian has not run out of cash yet. \"But we need ventilator support to get through the winter,\" he said. Norwegian shares plunged on Monday morning, extending their drop this year to a 99% fall. Where now for Norwegian? Without government money, it will need to find other sources of cash, either from existing shareholders or outside investors. That may prove tricky.  Before the Covid outbreak, Norwegian was seen as a standard-bearer for the low-cost, long haul model. It certainly ruffled feathers among established long-haul operators, but struggled to make money. For the moment Norwegian is a shadow of its former self. It is focusing on a limited number of short-haul routes, centred on the Nordic region, although it has begun selling tickets for some long-haul services next year. But with the aviation market not expected to recover to pre-Covid levels until 2024, and with travel restrictions and quarantine measures still widespread, it is a challenging environment for any investor. More cash may be hard to find - and with current reserves fast running out, Norwegian needs it quickly.   The Norwegian government has given support to its airline industry during the coronavirus crisis. In March, it offered a loan guarantee scheme worth 6bn krone (\u00a3500m), where the government would pick up 90% of that risk. Half of that guarantee scheme went to Norwegian Air, while 1.5bn krone was directed at rival SAS and the remaining 1.5bn went to Wideroe and other airlines. In May, creditors and lessors took control of Norwegian Air, allowing it to access those state-guaranteed loans. But on Monday, Norway's coalition government, which has long-ruled out nationalisation of carriers, said no more guarantees would be forthcoming. \"It is a tough message to get. But we are answerable for the responsible use of public funds,\" said industry minister Iselin Nyboe. \"Norwegian Air has a financial structure that makes it risky for us to go in with support. It was not defensible,\" she said. Norwegian Air's expansion left it with debt of close to \u00a36bn by mid-2020, making it vulnerable to the effects of Covid-19 pandemic, which has severely affected the frequency of flights. Last month, Norwegian operated only 21 of its aircraft, leaving more than 100 grounded, including its fleet of 37 Boeing 787 Dreamliners used for transatlantic journeys. The company has said that more funding could come from the sale of aircraft, the conversion of more debt to equity, or from its owners and the Norwegian government. The government said that so far this year it had provided an estimated 13bn krone in support for the airline industry including loans, guarantees and tax cuts.",

Under the deal the Hong Kong government could take a 6% stake in Cathay and can have two observers on its board. As part of the restructuring plan the company said it would implement another round of executive pay cuts. It comes as airlines around the world are struggling to survive due to global travel restrictions. Cathay has grounded most of its flights due to coronavirus-related travel curbs. It has been flying only cargo and a cut-back passenger schedule to major destinations such as Beijing, Los Angeles, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo and Vancouver. \"Cathay Pacific has explored available options and believes that a recapitalisation is required to ensure it has sufficient liquidity to weather this current crisis,\" the company said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. The company also said it would consider further measures to safeguard its future: \"In the longer term, all aspects of the Cathay Pacific Group's business model will be re-evaluated.\" The carrier has furloughed some pilots at overseas bases and cut cabin crew roles in the US and Canada since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, but has not announced major permanent job cuts. Cathay announced that it would carry out a second voluntary leave scheme for workers as part of the recapitalisation plan. Shares in Cathay and major shareholders Swire Pacific and Air China halted trading on Tuesday morning ahead of the announcement.  Under the deal Swire's stake in Cathay will fall from 45% to 42%, while Air China's holding will drop from 30% to 28%. Governments around the world have bailed out airlines as demand plunges, and in some cases, such as Germany's Lufthansa, are taking direct equity stakes.

The airline also sold six Boeing 777-300ER jets and associated equipment for more than $700m (\u00a3551m) in March.",

            "title": "Iran plane downing: Victims' governments press Tehran for answers",
            "text": "Iran is facing fresh pressure to give a full accounting of how the Ukrainian plane with 176 people on board was shot down over Tehran last week. In London, ministers from five nations which lost citizens demanded \"full co-operation\" from Iran in a transparent international inquiry into the crash.  The foreign ministers of Afghanistan, Britain, Canada, Sweden and Ukraine also said Iran must pay compensation. Iran has said the plane was brought down by a missile fired in error. The Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800, travelling to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and carrying many passengers on their way to Canada, was downed amid escalating tensions between Iran and the US. There were no survivors.  Hours before, Iranian missiles had targeted two airbases in Iraq housing US forces. For three days after the tragedy Iran denied any responsibility but after international pressure, the hardline Revolutionary Guards admitted that the plane had been mistaken for a \"cruise missile\" and shot down. The crisis has come at an extremely sensitive time for Iran, both in terms of its relationship with the international community and at home, where there have been anti-government protests.  At a news briefing, the five foreign ministers said they had agreed on five key demands to Iran, including a \"thorough, independent and transparent international investigation\" and compensation to the victims' families. Speaking on behalf the group, Canadian Foreign Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said: \"We are here to pursue closure, accountability, transparency and justice for the victims - Ukrainian, Swedish, Afghan, British, Canadian as well as Iranian, through a full complete and transparent international investigation.   \"In the wake of such a horrific tragedy there are many many questions. Families want answers, all of the countries assembled here today want answers, and the international community want answers. The world is waiting for those answers and we will not rest until we get them.\" Mr Champagne said all those responsible must be brought to justice.  Earlier on Thursday, the five ministers lit memorial candles at the Canadian High Commission in London to honour the victims. Canada is investigating reports that the families of some victims have been harassed by authorities in Iran and urged to keep quiet. Many of the foreign nationals killed are believed to have held dual nationality and Canada's government says it is \"deeply concerned\" about alleged pressure on Iranian-Canadian families not to repatriate remains. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC on Tuesday that he was \"glad\" Iran had acknowledged making a \"terrible mistake\" in shooting down the plane. \"It's good that they've apologised. The most important thing now is that tensions in the region calm down,\" he added. Afghanistan, Britain, Canada, Sweden and Ukraine are considering what legal options they might have to hold Iran accountable. Mr Johnson has said the families of the British victims \"deserve justice and closure and we will continue to do everything we can to support them in getting that, including options for compensation\". Iran is creating a special court to oversee the investigation, but victims' families may want to pursue legal judgments elsewhere. Dozens of the victims are Canadian nationals and there have been calls in Canada for the government to list the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist entity, paving the way for lawsuits under a 2012 law allowing victims of terrorism to sue state sponsors of terrorism in civil courts. However, this would involve proving that the plane's downing was an intentional act of terrorism. Even if a case succeeded, claiming any damages awarded would be difficult given most of Iran's non-diplomatic assets in Canada have already been seized to collect damages in other cases. On Wednesday, Canadian investigators in Iran visited the site of the crash and examined the plane's wreckage. They are expecting to be able to participate in the analysis of the plane's black box flight recorders - a key part of figuring out exactly what happened to the plane and how it crashed. Iran arrested several people over the incident and President Hassan Rouhani said the investigation would be overseen by a \"special court\", noting that \"the whole world will be watching\".  The Revolutionary Guards has said a missile operator acted independently and alone, mistaking the plane for a \"cruise missile\" as there had been reports that such missiles had been fired at Iran after its strikes in Iraq. But Mr Rouhani has stressed that the \"tragic event\" should not be blamed on one individual. On Wednesday, in a sign of friction between the government and the armed forces over the incident, he called on Iran's military to elaborate on how it shot down the plane. His foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, acknowledged that Iranians had been \"lied to\" for days but insisted the government was also kept in the dark. The Revolutionary Guards, a force set up to defend the government after the 1979 revolution, has claimed government officials were alerted soon after the incident.  The shooting down of the plane and its fall-out led to days of protests in some Iranian cities, with demonstrators condemning the authorities for not telling the truth. Iran is facing pressures on many fronts - its economy is struggling under US sanctions, its most powerful general was recently killed by a US drone strike, and a nuclear deal it signed with world powers looks close to collapse.",

            "text": "Protesters who broke into Stansted Airport to stop a plane deporting people to Africa will face no further action through the courts. The group, known as the Stansted 15, cut through the perimeter fence and locked themselves together around a Boeing 767 jet in 2017. They won an appeal against their convictions last month. On Thursday, a spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service said it would not appeal against the decision. \"There will be no further action on this case,\" the statement added. The jet the group surrounded in March 2017 had been chartered by the Home Office to transport people from UK detention centres for repatriation to Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone. The protesters put their arms inside pipes which were then filled with expandable foam, and secured themselves around the nose wheel and wing of the aircraft, Chelmsford Crown Court was told during their trial. All 15 were convicted of the intentional disruption of services at an aerodrome, with three given suspended jail sentences, and the other 12 were handed community orders. At the appeal hearing in November, lawyers for the activists argued the legislation under which the 15 were convicted - the Aviation and Maritime Security Act (Amsa) 1990 - was rarely used and not intended for this type of case. The Stansted 15's barristers argued that the Amsa law was intended to deal with violence of the \"utmost seriousness\", such as terrorism, not demonstrators. In his judgement, given in January, the Lord Chief Justice said they \"should not have been prosecuted for the extremely serious offence\". Sitting with Mr Justice Jay and Mrs Justice Whipple, Lord Burnett said the protesters' \"conduct did not satisfy the various elements of the offence\". \"There was, in truth, no case to answer,\" he said. The CPS had 28 days to consider an appeal.  The 15 are: Helen Brewer, 31; Lyndsay Burtonshaw, 30; Nathan Clack, 32; Laura Clayson, 30; Melanie Evans, 37; Joseph McGahan, 37; Benjamin Smoke, 29; Jyotsna Ram, 35; Nicholas Sigsworth, 31; Melanie Strickland, 37; Alistair Tamlit, 32; Edward Thacker, 31; Emma Hughes, 40; May MacKeith, 35; and Ruth Potts, 46. Mr Smoke tweeted: \"We can finally say... IT'S OVER!!!!!!\" In a statement on behalf of the group, he added: \"Following the Court of Appeal's verdict last month which stated there was, in truth, no case to answer, we are of course overjoyed that the CPS have today decided to take no further action. \"After four long years, we finally have some justice, but there are tens of thousands of people who have been swept up and aside by our draconian and callous immigration system who still await theirs.  \"We will not stop fighting until the hostile environment is ended, until the brutal practices of raids, detention and deportations are halted and until justice is done for all.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "text": "Two planes nearly collided at Boston's Logan Airport on Monday night after one flight took off without permission, air safety officials say. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said a JetBlue flight from Nashville took evasive action, narrowly avoiding a departing Learjet plane. The agency said it will investigate the \"close call\" to determine the proximity that the two planes came to each other.  It comes amid an alarming rise in safety incidents involving US planes.  \"According to a preliminary review, the pilot of a Learjet 60 took off without clearance while JetBlue Flight 206 was preparing to land on an intersecting runway,\" the FAA said in a statement provided to BBC News on Tuesday.  The near miss occurred around 19:00 local time (00:00GMT). An air traffic controller instructed the pilot of the Learjet \"to line up and wait\" on a runway that intersects another runway that the JetBlue flight was approaching for landing, the FAA says.  \"The Learjet pilot read back the instructions clearly but began a take-off roll instead,\" said the FAA statement. \"The pilot of the JetBlue aircraft took evasive action and initiated a climb-out as the Learjet crossed the intersection.\" \"The FAA will determine the closest proximity between the two aircraft as part of the investigation.\" The Learjear plane was being operated by private charter company Hop-a-Jet. A JetBlue spokesperson told US media the pilot performed a \"go-around\", a common manoeuvre triggered when a normal landing cannot proceed. \"Safety is JetBlue's first priority and our crews are trained to react to situations like this.\u00a0We will assist authorities as they investigate this incident.\" The JetBlue flight landed 14 minutes late, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Several startling incidents led US senators on 15 February to hold a hearing to call on the FAA to review safety measures, and examine the glitch in their computer system that delayed thousands of flights across the country last month. In January, a similar near collision occurred at New York's John F Kennedy International Airport. In December, a United Airlines plane leaving Hawaii nose dived to just 800ft (245m) above the Pacific Ocean before recovering and continuing safely to San Francisco.  One day before the Senate hearing, the FAA said it would conduct a \"safety call to action\" and compile a team to investigate the recent incidents.  \"We are experiencing the safest period in aviation history, but we cannot take this for granted,\" said acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen. \"Recent events remind us that we must not become complacent.\" Aviation industry have told BBC News that a wave of recent retirements, that sped-up during the Covid pandemic shutdown, have created staffing shortages across the industry.  Those shortages are felt from airport baggage departments to pilots, all the way to the FAA, the federal agency in charge of air traffic control and air safety.  The FAA, which is led by an administrator appointed by the president, has had three administrators over the span of just five years, and has been without a permanent administrator since last April.

Katsutoshi Jitsukawa, 42, who works for Japan Airlines, was arrested on 28 October after failing a breath test. He was found to have 189mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in his system - the legal limit for a pilot is 20mg. The first officer pleaded guilty to exceeding the alcohol limit at Uxbridge Magistrates' Court on Thursday. Japanese broadcaster NHK reported that police were alerted by the driver of a crew bus who smelled alcohol on the pilot. He had been due to be part of a crew flying a Japan Airlines (JAL) flight JL44 to Tokyo but failed a breath test 50 minutes before the departure time.  The Boeing 777 aircraft took off after a 69-minute delay. JAL issued an apology and pledged to \"implement immediate actions to prevent any future occurrence\", adding that \"safety remains our utmost priority\". The drink-drive limit in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is 80mg per 100ml of blood, compared to 20mg for pilots. Jitsukawa was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at Isleworth Crown Court on 29 November. In June, British Airways pilot Julian Monaghan was jailed for eight months for being caught on duty with 86mg of alcohol in his system.

            "title": "Boeing's 'culture of concealment' to blame for 737 crashes",
            "text": "Two fatal crashes of Boeing 737 Max aircraft were partly due to the plane-maker's unwillingness to share technical details, a congressional investigation has found.  It blames a \"culture of concealment\" at Boeing, but says the regulatory system was also \"fundamentally flawed\". Boeing said it had \"learned many hard lessons\" from the accidents. But families of the victims accused the company and the regulator of continuing to hide information. The US report is highly critical of both Boeing and the regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). \"Boeing failed in its design and development of the Max, and the FAA failed in its oversight of Boeing and its certification of the aircraft,\" the 18-month investigation concluded. The Boeing 737 Max has been grounded since March 2019 after two crashes, in Indonesia and Ethiopia, caused the deaths of 346 people. The nearly 250-page report found a series of failures in the plane's design, combined with \"regulatory capture\", an overly close relationship between Boeing and the federal regulator, which compromised the process of gaining safety certification. \"[The crashes] were the horrific culmination of a series of faulty technical assumptions by Boeing's engineers, a lack of transparency on the part of Boeing's management, and grossly insufficient oversight by the FAA.\" \"Cost-cutting\u2026 that jeopardised the safety of the flying public\", a \"culture of concealment\" over issues with the aircraft, \"troubling mismanagement misjudgements\" - just a snapshot of the stinging charges against Boeing.  But the US aviation regulator, the FAA, comes off almost as badly. US representatives find it guilty of \"inherent conflicts of interest\" and \"grossly insufficient oversight\".  More seriously, they say the regulator was, in effect, in Boeing's pocket and that the FAA's management \"overruled\" its own technical and safety experts \"at the behest of Boeing\". Boeing admits \"mistakes were made\" and it now wants to focus on getting the 737-Max back in the air, saying the \"revised design\" of the aircraft has been \"thoroughly scrutinised\". Regulators in Europe and the US are relatively close to recertifying the 737-Max. But this is one of the biggest safety scandals facing a private company in modern times.  And other investigations are outstanding, including a giant lawsuit from the relatives of those killed in the second crash in Ethiopia.  Boeing said it had made \"fundamental changes\" to the company as a result of the accidents.  The FAA said it would work with lawmakers to \"implement improvements identified in the report\". The report said Boeing had failed to share information about a key safety system, called MCAS, designed to automatically counter a tendency in the 737 Max to pitch upwards. Boeing was at fault for \"concealing the very existence of MCAS from 737 pilots\", it found. MCAS was not in crew manuals and Boeing sought to convince regulators not to require simulator training for Max pilots, which would incur extra costs. The MCAS system has been blamed for both crashes that came within months of each other, shortly after the plane went into operation. \"The FAA should immediately halt the recertification process for the 737 Max in light of this report,\" said Michael Stumo, whose daughter Samya Rose Stumo died in the Ethiopian crash in March 2019. \"The FAA and Boeing hid information before and are doing it again,\" he added. \"Both Boeing and the FAA have refused to provide their data that support their efforts to unground the plane.  The Max should not fly until Boeing and the FAA provide this data, so independent experts and the public can confirm the aircraft is safe.\" British national Zipporah Kuria, whose father was killed in the same crash, said it would be \"grossly irresponsible\" to recertify the 737 Max. \"My heart is shattered. My dad lost his life and I lost him,\" she said  \"If I'd lost him because of a faulty sensor, I may have come to accept it as an incident, but I lost my dad to greed, corruption and lack of human decency.  \"This is why we need to axe the Max. The public shouldn't continue bearing the cost for corner-cutters who do not seem to have a conscience.\" Paul Njoroge of Canada, whose entire family was killed on their trip to Kenya to visit grandparents, said the report documented \"clear dereliction of duty by Boeing and the FAA in the design and certification process of the 737 Max\". \"It is, therefore, clear that at Boeing, safety comes after cost-cutting, profit-maximisation and share price pumpage,\" he added. \"Further, the report has undoubtedly cast the FAA as a 'captured' regulator - the FAA is therefore an agency promoting Boeing and the industry, instead of promoting the safety of the flying public.\" Regulators around the world are currently putting the modified 737 Max through its paces. The FAA began test flights in June, while the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) started its own testing programme earlier this month. EASA has maintained that clearance by the FAA will not automatically mean the plane is considered airworthy in Europe. \"Once the FAA and other regulators have determined the Max can safely return to service, it will be one of the most thoroughly scrutinised aircraft in history, and we have full confidence in its safety,\" Boeing said.",

            "title": "Boeing to temporarily halt 737 Max production in January",
            "text": "Boeing will temporarily halt production of its troubled 737 Max airliner in January, the manufacturer said. Production of the jet had continued despite the model being grounded for nine months after two deadly crashes. More than 300 people died when two 737 Max aircraft crashed in Indonesia and Ethiopia after reported problems with a new feature. Boeing had been hoping to have the planes back in the air by the end of this year. But US regulators made it clear that they would not be certified to return to the skies that quickly. Boeing is one of the largest US exporters. The company said in a statement that it would not lay off workers associated with the 737 Max, but the stoppage is likely to affect suppliers and the wider economy. \"Safely returning the 737 Max to service is our top priority,\" the aircraft manufacturer said.  \"We know that the process of approving the 737 Max's return to service, and of determining appropriate training requirements, must be extraordinarily thorough and robust, to ensure that our regulators, customers, and the flying public have confidence in the 737 Max updates.\" Last week a congressional hearing was told that US aviation regulators were aware, following the first crash in Indonesia in October 2018, that there was a risk of further accidents. The Federal Aviation Authority's analysis suggested there could be more than a dozen more crashes over the lifetime of the aircraft unless changes were made to its design. Despite that, the 737 Max was not grounded until after the second crash in Ethiopia in March 2019.  Boeing is redesigning the automated control system thought to have been the primary cause of the crashes. The manufacturer said it had 400 of the 737 Max aircraft in storage and would focus on delivering those to customers. While many airlines around the world have the planes on order, delivery was halted to allow Boeing's engineers to develop software fixes. The situation surrounding the 737 Max is extraordinary.  Nine months after the aircraft was grounded worldwide, it is still not clear when it will be certified to fly again. Regulators - criticised for allowing a flawed aircraft to fly in the first place - are now playing hardball. For Boeing, being forced to shut down the production line is deeply embarrassing - and likely to prove costly. But it is a huge business, and it can at least redeploy many of its workers. But if the stoppage goes on for long, suppliers could be badly hit.  Boeing sits at the top of a global supply chain, ranging from major businesses to small operators. Here in the UK, for example, the company works across 65 sites, including a factory in Sheffield. But it draws on a network of some 300 suppliers. For smaller firms in particular, losing 737-related work could prove serious - hitting revenues and potentially forcing them to lay off workers as well. Travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt said the decision to suspend production was unprecedented and likely to have a \"massive impact on Boeing, its suppliers and the airlines\". \"It's really going to create some chaos for the airlines that are involved in this as well as the 600 or so companies that are part of the 737 Max supply chain and Boeing itself.\" The suspension of the 737 Max has already cost Boeing around $9bn (\u00a36.75bn). Boeing shares fell more than 4% on Monday amid speculation production would be suspended. The production freeze is expected to be felt across the plane's global supply chain. Teal Group aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia described Boeing's options for managing the blow to its suppliers as \"bad and worse\".    He said the plane maker could either allow them to take a hit, or pay them to wait for when the 737 Max is finally cleared to fly. US carriers operate the largest 737 Max fleets, though airlines around the world also use it.  \"The Chinese carriers would [also] be quite badly affected. They're some of the biggest users of the Max,\" said Shukor Yusof, aviation analyst at Endau Analytics. In fact, China's three largest carriers were among the first to press Boeing for compensation over the grounded planes. Aviation analyst Chris Tarry told the Today programme: \"The last thing any manufacturer wants is to stop the production line and it's going to take time to get it going again when the aircraft takes to the skies. \"If we look at it in terms of the volume of the impact on capacity growth in the industry, it is significant and it will take time to recover the production. Boeing's reputation will take time to recover from this as well.\"  Some suppliers, such as fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems, are highly dependent on the jet, with half of its revenue attached to it, according to Mr Aboulafia.  So far, the supplier has only said it is \"working closely\" with Boeing to determine what impact the production suspension may have.  The move by Boeing is unlikely to affect passengers as airlines have leased additional aircraft to replace the 737 Max.   It's a different story for airlines, who have the added expense of leasing planes and managing their grounded aircraft. In July, Boeing set aside nearly $5bn to compensate those affected. However, that figure assumed that the 737 Max would fly again this year. ",

            "title": "Indonesia Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737 'black boxes' located",
            "text": "\"Black boxes\" from a passenger plane that crashed into the sea soon after take-off in Indonesia on Saturday have been located, officials say. Navy divers are confident that they will be able retrieve the two flight recorders when the search operation resumes on Monday. Aircraft parts and human remains have been found. The Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737 was carrying 62 people when it vanished from radar on its journey to Borneo. \"We have located the position of the black boxes, both of them,\" said Soerjanto Tjahjono, head of Indonesia's transport safety committee, quoted by AFP earlier on Sunday. \"Divers will start looking for them now and hopefully it won't be long before we get them.\" The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, or black boxes as they are often called, store data about planes. They can provide vital information in air accident investigations. Investigators are analysing items which they believe to be a wheel and part of the plane's fuselage. A turbine from one of its engines is also among the debris that has been recovered. The search operation has been suspended for the night but is due to resume on Monday morning.  However, there appears to be no hope of finding any survivors. A spokesman for the Jakarta police, Yusri Yunus, said two bags had been received from the search and rescue agency. \"The first bag contained passengers' properties, another bag contained body parts,\" he told reporters, adding: \"We are still identifying these findings.\" Police are asking families of the victims to provide DNA samples and dental records to help identify the remains. The missing aircraft is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model that was grounded from March 2019 until last December following two deadly crashes. The Sriwijaya Air passenger plane departed from Jakarta airport at 14:36 local time (07:36 GMT) on Saturday. Minutes later, at 14:40, the last contact with the plane was recorded, with the call sign SJY182, according to the transport ministry.  The usual flight time to Pontianak, in West Kalimantan province in the west of the island of Borneo, is 90 minutes. The aircraft did not send a distress signal, according to the head of national search and rescue agency Air Marshal Bagus Puruhito. It is thought to have dropped more than 3,000m (10,000ft) in less than a minute, according to flight tracking website Flightradar24.com. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. Relatives of the passengers have been waiting anxiously for news at the airport in Pontianak, as well as at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. Afrida's 29-year-old son Angga Fernanda Afrion was on the flight.  Angga, a merchant seaman, had been told to go to Pontianak because his ship was damaged, she said. Just a week ago he had become a father. \"If he is gone what I want is to be able to bring him home and bury him properly,\" she told BBC Indonesia. Meanwhile relatives of the plane's captain, Afwan, a former air force pilot, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, described him as a devout Muslim and a \"very good man\". \"He was a prominent figure in his neighbourhood and was well-known for his kindness,\" says his nephew Ferza Mahardhika. \"I'm devastated and can't believe that this is happening. Please pray for uncle and our family.\"  According to registration details, the plane was a 26-year-old Boeing 737-500. It was in good condition, Sriwijaya Air chief executive Jefferson Irwin Jauwena told reporters. Take-off had been delayed for 30 minutes due to heavy rain, he said.  Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-East Asian destinations.  The plane went missing about 20km (12 miles) north of the capital Jakarta, not far from where another flight crashed in October 2018.  A total of 189 died when an Indonesian Lion Air flight plunged into the sea about 12 minutes after take-off from the city. That disaster was blamed on a series of failures in the plane's design, but also faults by the airline and the pilots. It was one of two crashes that led regulators to pull the Boeing 737 Max from service. The model resumed passenger flights in December after a systems overhaul. The BBC's Jerome Wirawan in Jakarta says the latest events will bring up difficult questions and emotions in Indonesia, whose airline industry has faced intense scrutiny since the Lion Air crash.",

            "text": "It would be a small irony if, amid unprecedented political turbulence and incompetence, the UK government successfully repatriated 150,000 holiday-makers from the collapsed Thomas Cook travel firm, and without too much hassle. We're much more attuned to fiasco. And there's plenty that can go wrong in hiring a fleet of planes from scratch, and transporting up to 17,000 people per day. If Chris Grayling were still transport secretary, what would the chances be of him contracting an airline without any planes? Day one, and the joint effort with the travel industry had 95% of those who had been scheduled to come home actually doing so - even though some were landing at the wrong airport. Signs of that apparent initial success for Project Matterhorn quickly turned attention to the loss of 9,000 jobs in Britain, and more than that again overseas, whose work depended on Thomas Cook custom. It turned also to the cost for flight-only passengers of finding a ticket that could get them home, finding that prices were soaring. They can keep rising even as they search and decide. And of course, it turned to the pay and bonuses of senior executives while the travel company traversed turbulent times and eventually crashed. Well, here are a few thoughts, many of them contrarian in nature. You'd expect little else, right? On that executive pay, \u00a38m in pay and bonuses for the chief executive over the past five years looks like the going rate for a company of this size. You might say the \"going rate\" is obscene. And compared with pay for cabin crew and others working unsociable hours, in cramped unhealthy aluminium tubes, and putting up with the rudeness of tanked-up British holiday-makers, then you'd have a point. It's neither my role nor inclination to defend executive pay, least of all in a company that's gone under.   But much of these bonuses are usually paid in shares, which executives are, usually, not allowed to cash in for several years after they've been \"earned\".  These long-term incentive plans are intended to encourage bosses to think, well, long-term. So if these millions in bonuses were tied up in Thomas Cook shares, then they're worthless now. On profiteering rivals, anyone who books an airline ticket online these days expects to find search engine software that digs out the lowest price and offers a wide range of choice.  That has worked pretty well for the customer. If you don't believe me, book a British rail ticket now: compare and contrast.  It's that same software that is causing prices to soar.  Surge pricing is a feature of airline, hotel and Uber booking.  If demand surges and supply falls, the algorithm kicks in and prices can go berserk. There may be means by which the algorithms' inflationary effect can be capped.  But according to Skyscanner, the Edinburgh air ticket search company that knows a thing or two about this end of the industry, such spikes tend to be short lived. Prices quickly adjust back down. Yes, they'll probably be higher than they were. But if a large chunk of capacity has just been taken out of the air, by an airline going bust, then the laws of supply and demand mean you'll be paying at least some more. And that brings us to the opportunity that comes form Thomas Cook's collapse.  It's clear that it had failed to adjust to changes in its marketplace, not least the move to online booking, and to personalised itineraries, with declining demand for conventional package holidays. One of its rivals, Tui, claims to have hedged against that, and against currency fluctuations that did so much damage to Thomas Cook, by vertically integrating. That is, it owns many of the hotels and cruise ships, rather than contracting with foreign-owned providers.  It still has to staff and fuel them in foreign currencies, and it faces headwinds from the Boeing 737 Max grounding and from Brexit uncertainty. But in a statement to reassure investors on Tuesday, Tui was keen to distance itself from the Thomas Cook way of doing things. Its share price rose. So did the market valuation of Jet2, Ryanair, and IAG, owner of British Airways. Why? Because of that opportunity. Thomas Cook's failure does not mean the British have stopped wanting to go on foreign holidays. Not only were 150,000 Thomas Cook customers overseas when the company went bust, but a million or so more were booked for future holidays. And while they may have lost deposits and worse, these people still want a holiday to look forward to. Many more will book closer to the next holiday season. So the airlines and other travel companies that can grab market share have a big opportunity.  You can safely bet they're hard at work on exploiting it. For airlines, the rebound may be subdued.  For the past couple of years, there has been over-capacity in the lower-cost segment of the European market. The departure of Thomas Cook relieves some of the pressure on Ryanair and its ilk. For those successful in grabbing market share in this people-intensive industry, they will need to recruit skilled travel industry workers, from cabin crew to booking agents to foreign hoteliers. It's clearly very tough to lose one's job. And the evidence we're seeing is that Thomas Cook had a dedicated workforce, who deserved better. But in a tight labour market, there are much worse circumstances in which to be forced into the search for a new job. Not every sector can be so confident. While some see the demise of Thomas Cook as a victim of Brexit, others see it as an early sign of the corporate clear-out that comes with an economic downturn. If so, others will follow in other sectors. The harsh, sometimes brutal Darwinism of the marketplace will take the weak, goes the orthodoxy. It will clear space for growth of the more nimble, innovative and lucky. It may also re-shape the job market for those whose skills are aligned and adaptable to the future demands of fast-changing technology.",

            "title": "Ethiopian Airlines crash: FAA says Boeing 737 Max 8 is airworthy",
            "text": "The US Federal Aviation Administration has told airlines it believes Boeing's 737 Max 8 model to be airworthy, after two fatal crashes inside six months. An Ethiopian Airlines plane en route from Addis Ababa to Nairobi crashed six minutes after take-off on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board. The incident followed Lion Air 737 Max 8 crash in October that killed 189. Some in the aviation community have called for the aircraft to be grounded pending a full investigation. But late on Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a \"continued airworthiness notification\" saying the plane was safe to fly. China, Indonesia, and Ethiopia on Monday ordered their airlines to ground the jet. Aerolineas of Argentina, Mexico's Aeromexico and Brazil's Gol have also suspended flights of the aircraft.  The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore on Tuesday said it was \"temporarily suspending operation of all variants of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft into and out of Singapore\". The suspension will take effect from 14:00 local time (06:00 GMT).  Other airlines kept flying the 737 Max 8 after Boeing said it was safe. Shares in Boeing fell by 12.9% on Monday in the wake of the crash. US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said the FAA would \"take immediate and appropriate action\" if a defect was found in the plane. FAA chief Dan Elwell said the notification \"informs the international community where we are and (gives) ... one answer to the whole community\".  Paul Hudson, the president of FlyersRights.org and a member of the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee, called for the plane to be grounded. \"The FAA's 'wait and see' attitude risks lives as well as the safety reputation of the US aviation industry,\" Mr Hudson said in a statement on Monday. The aircraft came down near the town of Bishoftu, 60km (37 miles) south-east of the capital. The cause of the disaster is not clear, but the pilot had reported difficulties and asked to return to Addis Ababa. Investigators have found the cockpit voice recorder and digital flight data recorder  but it will be a while before the findings are made public. Visibility was said to be good but air traffic monitor Flightradar24 reported that the plane's \"vertical speed was unstable after take-off\".  The pilot was named as Senior Capt Yared Getachew, who Ethiopian Airlines said had a \"commendable performance\" over more than 8,000 hours in the air. Several witnesses who worked in the farmland below the plane's flight path told the Reuters news agency they heard loud rattling noises coming from the aircraft. \"When it was hovering, fire was following its tail, then it tried to lift its nose,\" said one witness, Gadisa Benti. \"When it passed over our house, the nose pointed down and the tail raised up. It went straight to the ground with its nose, it then exploded.\" Rolled out in 2017, the Max 8 is the latest iteration of the 737 line. By the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 of the model of 5,011 orders. The plane that crashed was among six of 30 that Ethiopian Airlines had ordered as part of its expansion. It underwent a \"rigorous first check maintenance\" on 4 February, the airline said. Boeing said it was \"deeply saddened\" by the crash and was sending a team to provide technical assistance. Following last October's Lion Air crash in Indonesia, investigators said the pilots had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling, a new feature of the jet. The anti-stall system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, despite efforts by pilots to correct this, preliminary findings suggested. The Lion Air plane was also new and the accident happened soon after take-off. After that accident, Boeing sent an emergency notice to airlines warning them of a problem with the anti-stall system.  Boeing is expected to release a software patch to the system to deal with the issue, Reuters reports. It is not yet clear whether the anti-stall system was the cause of Sunday's crash. Aviation experts say other technical issues or human error cannot be discounted. There were people of more than 30 nationalities on the flight, including 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians and nine Britons (two of whom were dual nationals travelling on non-British passports). Among the Canadians was a family of six, originally from India. Kosha Vaidya, 37, and her husband Prerit Dixit, 45 were taking their 14-year-old daughter Ashka and 13-year-old daughter Anushka to Nairobi - where Kosha was born - along with her parents, Pannagesh Vaidya, 73, and Hansini Vaidya, 67. There were also eight Italians, eight Chinese, eight Americans, seven French citizens, six Egyptians, five Germans, four Indians and four people from Slovakia on board. At least 21 passengers were affiliated with the UN and were travelling to a session of its Environment Assembly in Nairobi. \"It is one of the biggest catastrophes we have had in years,\" Michael Moller, director-general of the UN Office in Geneva, told the session on Monday. The investigation will be led by Ethiopian authorities in co-ordination with teams of experts from Boeing and the US National Transportation Safety Board. Ethiopian Airlines said it had grounded all of its 737 Max 8s \"until further notice\" as \"an extra safety precaution\". The airline's first flight to Kenya since the crash touched down at 10:25 local time on Monday, and a different model of plane was used.",

            "text": "Trump's Air Force One looks similar to the one that Obama flew. But plans for a bigger one are now under way.   The US president walked down the stairs of Air Force One at an airport in Morristown, New Jersey. He gave a thumbs-up to journalists standing on the tarmac and as he walked past the cameras, he straightened the lapel of his jacket.  An image-conscious businessman, he brags about the size of his hands and his ability to make a deal. For the new presidential aircraft, he wants both - a big machine that'll save the taxpayer money. Trump tweeted after the election that he wants to cut costs for the presidential aeroplane, but he's also said enviously that another head of state, the emir of Kuwait, has a bigger one. Air Force personnel are scrambling to make the new aeroplane happen - and meet the president's demands. They're looking at ways to ensure that the aircraft will be as cost-efficient as possible while at the same time embodies the heft that Trump wants.  Boeing executives said last week that they'd been awarded a contract for the aeroplane's redesign. \"We'll do our best to drive down costs,\" said Caroline Hutcheson, a Boeing spokeswoman. The president is tinkering with an icon, a symbol of \"the global reach of American diplomacy and power\", as Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst with a Virginia-based consultancy, the Teal Group, described it. The first Air Force One jet flew in 1959 with President Dwight D Eisenhower on board. It was red and gold. President John F Kennedy changed the colours to blue and white, the distinctive look it still has today.  A fleet of presidential aircraft are kept in a hangar at an Air Force base in Maryland. Trump went on a tour of the base before flying to New Jersey. He walked past an array of different-sized, blue-and-white aircraft emblazoned with the words: \"United States of America\". Any of them could serve as Air Force One, which is an air traffic control designation that's given to a plane when the president is on board. Aside from ferrying the president, the aircraft have several important traits - they have encrypted communications, for example, and they can withstand electromagnetic pulse from a nuclear explosion.  The most famous is a jumbo jet built on a Boeing 747-200B airframe. Trump flew on the jet to Paris in the summertime: it has several different cabins, one with thick carpets, powder blue melting into cobalt; chairs that swivel; and a table reserved for senior White House officials. Another one, a 757, or \"Baby Air Force One\", as it's known, has the same safety features built to scale. People were crammed into their seats on Friday on the flight from Maryland to New Jersey. Still the trip had luxurious aspects.  Butternut squash and linguine was served for dinner. Afterwards a flight attendant brought me two boxes of M&Ms as souvenirs from the journey. Decades ago passengers were given cigarettes and playing cards - along with other small items. \"They used to have barf bags,\" a military official said. There are only a few differences between his aeroplane and the one that Obama flew. The boxes used to have Obama's signature, and during his administration an overhead screen played CNN. Under Trump, it's Fox News. Otherwise the plane looks the same.  Trump can make small changes - he's complained about the softness of the hand towels and could replace them. At this point, though, they're the same (in my opinion, they have a nice, fleecy texture).  Bigger changes would have to undergo a vetting process for safety. That's what military personnel are doing now while they look at a redesign - and try to keep costs low.  Weeks after the election, Trump tweeted that Boeing was making a new presidential aircraft \"but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Since that time, Air Force officials and Boeing executives have tried to make it seem as though they're acting in a frugal manner. The air force recently bought two Boeing 747-8s at a bargain price. That's what they say - they haven't revealed the cost, though, so it's hard to know. The new aircraft will replace the older model, the 747-200B, but it won't be ready for several years.  \"When it's time for a president to buy a new Air Force One, you buy it for the next president,\" said Aboulafia. The new plane will have the same features - medical facilities, defence safeguards, and other perks.  And it's bigger - the wingspan is nearly 30 feet longer than the old one. By any measure, that's likely to please the boss.",

            "text": "Reaction Engines Limited (REL), the UK company developing a revolutionary aerospace engine, has announced investments from both Boeing and Rolls-Royce.  REL, based at Culham in Oxfordshire, is working on a propulsion system that is part jet engine, part rocket engine.  The company believes it will transform the space launch market and usher in hypersonic travel around the Earth.  The new investments amount to \u00a326.5m.  Included in this sum are contributions from Baillie Gifford Asset Management and Woodford Investment Management.  It lifts the total capital raised in the past three years to about \u00a3100m. The British government has already put in \u00a360m. BAE Systems initially injected \u00a320m in 2015 and has invested new funds in this latest financial round.  \"Rolls-Royce and Boeing - these are really big names, and it's fantastic to be in this position,\" said REL CEO Mark Thomas.  \"Rolls are super-positive about the technology. They want us to be independent and innovative, and to push our technology as hard as possible. And Boeing - that's amazing. They are the world's biggest aerospace company, have decades of expertise and future plans that, for us I'm sure, will be really exciting,\" he told BBC News.  REL is developing what it calls the Sabre engine. This power plant is designed to push a vehicle from a standing start all the way to orbit in a single step.  It would work like a conventional jet engine up to about Mach 5.5 (5.5 times the speed of sound) before then transitioning to a rocket mode for the rest of the ascent.  Key technologies include a compact pre-cooler heat-exchanger that can take an incoming airstream of over 1,000C and cool it to -150C in less than 1/100th of a second. This would permit Sabre to use oxygen direct from the atmosphere for combustion instead of carrying it in a tank with the weight penalty that implies.  Although Sabre is usually talked about in the context of an orbiting spaceplane, it could also be fitted to a vehicle that flies at very high speed from point to point on the Earth's surface.  This is an application that clearly interests Boeing, whose investment arm, HorizonX Ventures, is driving the tie-up in what is its first investment in a UK-based company.  \"As Reaction Engines unlocks advanced propulsion that could change the future of air and space travel, we expect to leverage their revolutionary technology to support Boeing's pursuit of hypersonic flight,\" said HorizonX vice president, Steve Nordlund.  Those who have followed the REL story over the years will be aware that Rolls-Royce is not really a newcomer to the project. The aero-engine giant was involved in Sabre's precursor years - a spaceplane concept back in the 1980s known as Hotol.  When that hit technical difficulties, Rolls-Royce let its interest go, as did British Aerospace. Both are now back, the latter in its current guise as BAE Systems.  \"We are delighted to become a strategic investor in Reaction Engines Limited, an innovative UK company that is helping push the boundaries of aviation technology,\" Rolls' CTO Paul Stein said in a statement.  \"We look forward to working with REL and assisting with the development of their technology, and we plan to incorporate this technology into our own future products.\"  REL is approaching important demonstration milestones.  In Colorado this summer, it will begin further testing of the pre-cooler technology, confronting it with conditions that simulate the very hot airstreams encountered when vehicles move at hypersonic speeds.  This will be done under contract with the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).  Also this summer, REL should take control of its new test facility in the UK at Westcott in Buckinghamshire. It is here that the company will mount a demonstration in 2020 of the full Sabre cycle.  Assuming this goes well, REL would then look to put the technology on some kind of flight vehicle.  The company is expanding fast with more than 160 staff at its Culham HQ. The new investments will allow it to continue the recruitment. \"The team here is outstanding. We have some of the most talented engineers I've ever worked with, a high percentage of whom are women engineers; and we have a great apprenticeship programme. It feels like we're a good-news story and I want to keep it that way,\" said Mark Thomas. Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

            "text": "Shares in Brazilian plane-maker Embraer soared more than 20% on Thursday, after the company said it had held talks with Boeing about a possible combination. A deal with the US aerospace giant would join two of the world's biggest plane-makers. Any deal would require permission from the Brazilian government, which is a stakeholder in Embraer. News of the talks comes a few months after rivals Airbus and Bombardier announced an alliance. Europe's Airbus said it would take a majority stake in Bombardier's CSeries jet project, a line of narrow-body planes that the firms said would drive growth in coming years. That deal prompted questions from analysts about whether Boeing, which has focused on larger planes, would pursue its own joint venture or partnership to compete. In October Boeing said it was reviewing its options and that a deal was one possible use for surplus cash. Like Bombardier, Embraer is known for its smaller commercial jets.  It claims it is the leading manufacturer of commercial jets of up to 150 seats.  Its stock increased by more than 20% on Thursday, after the Wall Street Journal reported it had held talks with Boeing. The two companies later confirmed the discussions. Embraer employs about 18,000 people globally. It was formerly state-run and the government continues to hold a \"golden share\", which gives it veto powers over certain changes, including change of control. Brazilian President Michael Temer has said he is open to a deal but opposes selling a majority stake, the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo reported. Bombardier's CSeries is the subject of a bitter trade dispute that has strained relations between the US and Canada and the UK. The US is weighing possible trade duties of almost 300% on the jets, after Boeing said the Canadian company had received unfair subsidies that allowed below cost sales.",

            "text": "Boeing is to pay out $200m (\u00a3177.5m) over charges that it misled investors about two fatal 737 Max crashes. The US stock market regulator said the aviation giant and its former chief executive Dennis Muilenburg made false statements about safety issues.  Boeing \"put profits over people\" in an effort to rehabilitate its image, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The 737 Max was grounded for 20 months after two crashes killed 346 people. As part of the settlement Mr Muilenburg will also pay a penalty of $1m. \"In times of crisis and tragedy, it is especially important that public companies and executives provide full, fair, and truthful disclosures to the markets,\" SEC chairman Gary Gensler said in a statement. Boeing and Mr Muilenburg \"failed in this most basic obligation,\" he added. The SEC's statement also said that both Boeing and Mr Muilenburg did not admit or deny the regulator's findings. \"We will never forget those lost on Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, and we have made broad and deep changes across our company in response to those accidents,\" Boeing said in response to the SEC's announcement. \"Fundamental changes that have strengthened our safety processes and oversight of safety issues, and have enhanced our culture of safety, quality, and transparency,\" the company added. The SEC said a fund will be established for investors who suffered losses due to the misleading information between 2018 and 2019. This settlement is largely symbolic. The 737 Max scandal has already cost Boeing tens of billions - another $200m will barely register. But it does give the SEC the chance to call out Boeing and its ex-chief executive Dennis Muilenburg for making assurances about the plane's safety, when they already knew it had a serious problem - thereby misleading investors. It's unlikely this will cause Boeing any meaningful harm. Its corporate reputation had already been severely damaged by the affair. The company is now working hard to restore it, and regain public and investor confidence. For Mr Muilenberg himself, the financial consequences of the settlement won't be that painful either. He received some $60m in compensation and benefits when he left the company. But the fact that the SEC chose to charge him personally sends out a powerful signal. There have been criticisms in some quarters that the ex-boss has not been properly held to account for his role in the affair. On this occasion, though, the finger has been pointed squarely in his direction. On 29 October 2018, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the Java Sea 13 minutes after taking off from Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, killing all 189 passengers and crew. Less than five months later, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, another Boeing 737 Max on its way to Kenya, crashed six minutes after leaving Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa. All 157 people on board were killed. The crashes were linked to a flight control system called the \"Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System\" (MCAS) in the Boeing 737 Max. The SEC said that \"after the first crash, Boeing and Mr Muilenburg knew that MCAS posed an ongoing airplane safety issue, but assured the public that the 737 Max was safe to fly. The crashes have cost Boeing more than $20bn, including payments to families of those killed in the crashes. In the wake of the incidents, the US Congress passed new legislation reforming how the country's aviation regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), certifies new planes.  A small number of trials are expected to start next year to resolve outstanding claims.",

The move affects billions of dollars worth of goods. including tractors, wine and cheese. It comes a day after the US agreed to suspend its tariffs on UK imports stemming from the dispute. The US said the step marked a \"fresh start\" to US-EU trade relations. European Commission Executive Vice-President and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis also called it a \"reset\" for the relationship, which grew strained under former President Donald Trump. \"Removing these tariffs is a win-win for both sides, at a time when the pandemic is hurting our workers and our economies,\" he said. \"This suspension will help restore confidence and trust, and therefore give us the space to come to a comprehensive and long-lasting negotiated solution.\" The dispute between the US and EU over the aircraft subsidies goes back nearly two decades.  In 2019, the World Trade Organization ruled that the EU had illegally provided support to Airbus, clearing the way for the US to respond with tariffs worth up to $7.5bn (\u00a35.4bn) in annual trade. Roughly one year later, in a parallel case, it ruled that the US benefits to Boeing also violated trade rules, authorising the EU to hit the US with tariffs worth roughly $4bn. Since then, both sides have taken steps to remove the assistance found at fault. However, it was not clear whether the tariffs would be lifted under Mr Trump, who had embraced such taxes as part of his trade policy, at one point calling himself a \"Tariff Man\".  In December, the UK said it would voluntarily suspend its tariffs on US goods. Officials said they hoped to kickstart compromise talks, casting the measure as an example of the benefits to the UK's ability to act as an independent trading nation following Brexit. The US did not respond in kind until this week.",

Bombardier won a landmark case in the US, overturning a decision to impose huge tariffs on imports of its C-Series planes, partly built in the UK. It followed a ruling by the US Commerce Department that the UK and Canada had given it unfair subsidies. MPs say pressure must be maintained on Boeing. Boeing has yet to decide whether to appeal its defeat at the US International Trade Commission last month.  The ruling overturned huge penalty tariffs about to be imposed on US imports of Bombardier's C-Series planes, risking jobs in Belfast. The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee says the government must continue to protect Bombardier's Northern Ireland operations from punitive action.  In a report, the committee says existing government contracts with Boeing should be reviewed and past behaviour taken into account when bidding takes place for future contracts. Committee Chair, Dr Andrew Murrison, said the government must ensure that UK based businesses are \"watertight\" against similar action in the future. \"It's such a relief for workers and the Northern Ireland economy but we are left wondering about the needless damage Boeing's flimsy claims might have caused. \"When spurious complaints like Boeing's can mean months of uncertainty for UK workers, the government must be robust.\" He added that multinational companies should \"expect a frosty reception\" if they engage in action that harms the UK economy.",

            "text": "Boeing has said it does not expect its 737 Max plane to return to the skies before the summer, which is longer than initially expected. The jet has been grounded since March after two fatal crashes, which together killed 346 people. Boeing has been working on fixes to try to get the 737 Max planes back up and running. But the company has struggled to convince regulators that the planes are safe to fly. It previously said it expected the planes to be cleared for approval before the end of 2019. But in December, Boeing announced plans to halt production of the aircraft and last week, it confirmed it had found a new problem in the software. Boeing shares dropped by more than 5% on Tuesday as word of the delay started to spread, prompting the New York Stock Exchange to temporarily halt trading until the company's formal update. Boeing said its new guidance for \"mid-2020\" was \"informed by our experience to date with the certification process\". \"Returning the Max safely to service is our number one priority, and we are confident that will happen.\" The grounding has already cost Boeing more than $9bn, and the consequences are starting to spread, with at least one major supplier announcing layoffs. Several airlines dependent on the Max had already said they were not counting on the plane until the summer. This is a major admission from Boeing, and one that reflects the new realism of the company under David Calhoun - just over a week into his tenure as chief executive. Getting the 737 Max back in the air remains a priority - but Boeing is not in control of the situation. The plane can only fly again once regulators in the US and elsewhere are satisfied it is wholly safe. And the FAA, burned by the criticism it has faced over its relationship with Boeing, is re-examining the aircraft's design in minute detail. While the flaw that triggered the two accidents involving the plane has been addressed, other issues have been found, and delays have mounted up. Yet under ex-chief executive Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing repeatedly insisted the plane would fly again before the end of 2019. That didn't happen - and such bold statements merely undermined the relationship between the manufacturer and the FAA. Now, the company is acknowledging the process is likely to take a lot longer - not only due to problems it is already aware of, but also because of \"further developments that may arise\" during the certification process. It's an admission that comes less than two weeks after Boeing released a trove of damaging internal messages. These tended to reinforce the impression of a company whose corporate culture had become deeply dysfunctional. It certainly looks as though David Calhoun wants to get all the damaging information out there as soon as possible. He can then present his own regime as a fresh start - and focus on getting the 737 Max back in the air, without the time pressures that hamstrung his predecessor. This is the first update on the 737 since new chief executive David Calhoun started last week, and one week before he faces investors when Boeing publishes its quarterly results. Boeing has been under intense scrutiny since two 737 Max planes crashed within five months of each other, first in Indonesia and then in Ethiopia. Air safety officials investigating the tragedies have identified an automated control system in the plane, known as MCAS, as a factor in both crashes. Boeing has said the MCAS software system, which relied on a single sensor, received erroneous data, which led it to override pilot commands and push the aircraft downwards. It has said it is fixing the software and has overhauled its review procedures. But US lawmakers, who are investigating the company, have said the firm was aware that the software system could be unreliable. They have accused the company of trying to hide the risks and rush the plane back into service, while criticising the US regulator - the Federal Aviation Administration - for failing in its duty of oversight. The 737 Max is Boeing's fastest selling aircraft. An updated version of the company's short- and medium-haul workhorse, it was designed to be more fuel efficient than its predecessors.",

            "text": "This is a traumatic time for families who lost 298 loved ones on flight MH17. Now they hope the trial of four men will provide answers to the downing of the Malaysian Airlines plane over eastern Ukraine in July 2014.  In the first week of the trial they have heard how distinctive bow tie-shaped steel fragments, consistent with those in a surface-to-air Buk missile warhead, were among those found lodged in the bodies of the crew, passengers' luggage and wreckage.  Listening in the high-security court next to Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, Silene Fredriksz was transported back to the horror of imagining the final moments of her 23-year-old son Bryce. \"The thought of what happened with the children when the plane was hit, how long were they conscious or not? Were they in shock, or what?\" she said. These agonising, exhausting questions plague so many of the relatives. There were 80 children on board flight MH17, which was shot down over a combat zone in eastern Ukraine, en route from Amsterdam to the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. Three Russians and a Ukrainian are accused of downing the plane and murdering everyone on board. All are suspected of being key pro-Russian separatists and none are attending the trial.  The most senior, Igor Girkin (also known as Strelkov), was commanding Russian-backed separatists in the area. Only one, Oleg Pulatov, has employed a team of Dutch lawyers to represent him. All the accused deny involvement in the crash of flight MH17, the use of a Buk missile system by separatists and the presence of a Buk in the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine. As the trial began, the judges said the key questions were whether the plane was shot down by a Russian-made missile, where the missile was fired from, and whether the four men on trial had played a role in the attack.  Extensive telephone intercepts were provided to show how the surface-to-air missile defence system arrived at the alleged launch site: Pervomaiskyi was a town controlled by Russian-backed separatists.  Mr Pulatov has said the references to the Buk were intended to fool Ukrainian forces.  However, investigators say the missile was transported from a Russian army base belonging to the 53rd anti-aircraft brigade in Kursk. Prosecutors produced a witness account of a missile being launched from a field near Pervomaiskyi. Presiding judge Hendrik Steenhuis concluded that Buk fragments found at the scene showed there were \"no other possible conclusions\".     Such was the meticulous sequencing of events in court that Silene Fredriksz was able to connect and retrace her son's and his girlfriend's movements. \"In my head I had the timeline of Bryce and Daisy in my head simultaneously,\" she told me. \"How they woke up, went to Schiphol, entered the plane and flew to this area, where the Buk was and there the two timelines come together.\" The court also heard details of prosecution witnesses from the pro-Russian side, including fighters present at the launch site. Most were referred to by a number so as to protect their identities: Russia has repeatedly disputed the investigators' findings and complained of prosecutors' unwillingness to use Russia's own conclusions. In March 2020, the prosecution told the court that Russia had frequently presented false claims in the seven years since the plane was shot down. Photoshopped images, with dates and altered satellite pictures, were presented by Moscow as alternative facts in the days after the crash, they say. Open source material has been widely used to reveal what happened on 17 July 2014, but the array of evidence and witness statements laid out in court shows how much work the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has done to corroborate aspects of their case.  \"What I found particularly interesting was the [Buk's] route back to Russia after MH17 was shot down,\" said Eliot Higgins, whose Bellingcat group pioneered the use of open source data.  \"There's very little information on that in open sources, so the details laid out in court provided a lot of previously unknown details, and demonstrated the range of evidence and witnesses they had to establish the details of that journey,\" he told me. According to Mr Higgins, investigators have been able to respond to Moscow's claims, as many of them \"Russia stole from internet MH17 conspiracy theorists and presented as their own\". That gave the team plenty of opportunity to familiarise themselves with the claims before Russia made them: \"many of them had already been debunked by various online communities.\" Before the trial began I joined a group of families as they laid 298 empty chairs on a stretch of lawn in view of the Russian embassy. It's become a ritual for the relatives, who still seek \"responsibility and full clarity\" - as it says on a plaque attached to a wooden bench they have placed there. Among them was Hans de Borst, whose only child Elsemiek, 17, was on board. She loved travelling and playing the piano.   He delivered a letter, care of the embassy, asking Russian President Vladimir Putin to provide any material that could help reveal the truth about what happened that day and why. Now the trial has begun, Mr de Borst is satisfied with the extensive evidence presented in court. \"It gave me a complete image of the days before [the crash],\" he told me. \"The bringing in of the Buk, the change in attitude [of the accused] after they found out what happened, the hierarchy in responsibilities and the exit.\" The trial resumes on 17 June. The prosecution and defence will present their cases. Eventually it will also hear testimony from relatives, who will explain the gravity and impact of their loss.  Hans de Borst has learned to be dispassionate about the trial: \"I can separate the grief I feel about losing Elsemiek and what is happening; otherwise I would be crying all day in the courtroom.\"  The court will also deal with 299 claims for compensation from the next of kin.  Days after the atrocity, I watched as a Hercules transport plane brought back victims' remains to a military base in Eindhoven while a bugler played the Last Post.  Flags represented countries that had lost citizens - the Netherlands, Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia, the UK, Germany, Belgium, the Philippines, Canada and New Zealand. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte later vowed that the person who pushed the button to fire the missile would be brought to justice.  For many that seemed an impossible task. But with the start of this trial, and the evidence presented in the past few days, there is a flicker of faith that the relatives may find out. Even if there is little expectation anyone will ever be extradited or confess to mass murder.",

England take on Croatia at the Luznihki Stadium in Moscow on Wednesday night in the World Cup semi-final. One England fan told the BBC he spent \u00a37,000 on tickets for the semi-final and flights. British Airways said 860 passengers had booked onto flights to Moscow and St Petersburg, amid a \"party atmosphere\". The airline put on bigger planes for the two routes in order to cope with the demand for seats. Part of the airport was transformed to get fans in the mood for the semi-final. Much larger Boeing 777 planes, which can carry about 390 passengers, replaced the normal domestic-sized planes which tend to carry 140 passengers on the routes to the Russian cities. British Airways said \"searches for flights to Russia went up by 2000%\" after England beat Sweden in the quarter-finals. One fan, Charlie, 15, said his schoolfriends \"did not know\" he had managed to get tickets to go. He said: \"I think it is coming home, and England are going to win 2-1 in extra time.\" Another fan, Steve, said he \"had been through five hours of sheer hell\" to get his hands on match tickets which cost him $750 in a re-sale. BBC London's Greg McKenzie Lots of England fans young and old have rushed by me towards the planes taking them to Russia. Just like any other day, there are some who have made the flights with seconds to spare - which is just as well as there are no more seats left. For those here early, they were given a free navy waistcoat to mark Gareth Southgate's touchline look. It is certainly a fun atmosphere, some fans I have spoken to feel this is the opportunity of a lifetime had have spent a lot of money to follow England.",

            "text": "Bombardier workers face uncertainty after the Canadian aerospace giant announced 5,000 job cuts around the world. The struggling plane and train manufacturer said more than half of the cuts, to be made over the next 12-18 months, would be made in Canada. The company said the job cuts would be made to \"streamline\" operations as part of a broader restructuring plan.  Bombardier employs 70,000 people worldwide.  The Montreal-based company has production and engineering sites in 28 countries. The company estimates the job cuts - about 7% of the global workforce - will save $250m (\u00a3190m).  The cuts will come mostly from its aerospace division with some from the firm's rail division.  Bombardier says that 2,500 workers will be cut in the Canadian province of Quebec and 500 workers from the province of Ontario.  A spokesman said the firm does not yet have details on the remaining expected job losses.  The announcement came as Bombardier unveiled its third-quarter results, in which pre-tax profits doubled to $267m for the three months to September compared with the same period last year. Sales were down 5% to $3.6bn, but revenue is expected to jump 10% to at least $18bn next year. The firm will also sell two of its \"non-core\" businesses, its Q Series aircraft for $900m and the de Havilland trademark,  for $300m. \"We continue to make solid progress executing our turnaround plan,\" said chief executive Alain Bellemare in a statement.  \"We have set in motion the next round of actions necessary to unleash the full potential of the Bombardier portfolio.\"  Earlier this year, Bombardier sold a majority stake in its loss-making C-Series aircraft to Europe's Airbus, with the plane being renamed the A220. Mr Bellemare was brought in three years ago to shore up Bombardier, which was facing serious financial trouble with the C Series programme and had to be rescued by the Quebec government with a $1bn bailout.",

            "text": "The world's longest commercial flight has left Singapore for New York, beginning a journey scheduled to cover more than 15,000km in almost 19 hours. Singapore Airlines is relaunching the service five years after it was cut because it had become too expensive.  Flight SQ22 departed at 15:37GMT with 150 passengers and 17 crew. The inaugural flight from Changi Airport to Newark's international airport, which services New York, took off amid much fanfare. However, Singapore Airlines told passengers before take off that their flight to Newark, while still the world's longest flight by distance, could only take some 17 hours.  Qantas launched a 17-hour non-stop service from Perth to London earlier this year, while Qatar runs a 17.5-hour service between Auckland and Doha.  Singapore Airlines (SIA) said there was demand for customers for non-stop services which help cut travelling times compared with flights which have a stopover. Ahead of the take-off, the airline told the BBC that business class seats for the flight were fully booked, and there were \"a very limited number\" of premium economy seats left.  The airline is not planning to offer any economy bookings on the route.    A business class ticket will entitle passengers to two meals, and the choice of when they are served, plus refreshments in between. They will also have a bed to sleep in. Premium economy fares will get three meals at fixed times, with refreshments in between.  The brand new Airbus plane that SIA is using has been configured to seat 161 passengers in all - 67 business passengers and 94 premium economy passengers. \"The thinking behind that is that they are selling a premium product - it's for the top end of town,\" says aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas, who was booked on to Thursday's flight.  \"This is a route between two massive financial hubs, and so they will fill this plane up with business people, or well-heeled travellers who want the convenience of a non stop flight. \"It's also been proven that when carriers introduce a new non-stop route, the traffic on that route increases threefold.\" Mr Thomas, the editor-in-chief of airline rating site Airlineratings.com, has been on several such inaugural flights, including Qantas' new long-haul from Perth to London, inaugurated earlier this year.  He said: \"The Qantas flight to London was a huge event.  We were basically on our feet for the entire flight, it was incredibly exciting. There's almost a party atmosphere on board.\" Qantas meanwhile is in advanced discussions with Airbus and Boeing over an aircraft capable of making a 20-hour flight between London and Sydney. The Australian national flag carrier also plans to fly non-stop from Australia to North America - slightly shorter than the London-Sydney non-stop flight. But Max Kingsley-Jones, group editor of Flight Global, warned that plans for new non-stop routes had a habit of changing in line with the economics of the world. \"In the boom times you get a lot of what we call direct-connect flights between smaller cities\u2026 [then] each time there's a downturn you see all those tail off, and then we go back to people flying over hubs,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.  \"Even though it costs more for an airline to fly over a hub, they'll always charge you less because of the disadvantage of going via somewhere else.\" Of two possible routes that SIA could take to Newark, SIA has told passengers it will take the North Pacific route.  Mr Thomas says it will cover a distance of some 15,341km, but reminds non-aviation experts that while the distance between destinations remains constant, the distance flown and flight times can vary because of tailwinds, headwinds and any need for weather-related diversions. \"When you've got some good strong jet streams going in an easterly direction, which is the way we'll go, then we will fly over Japan, then over the North Pacific, possibly touching into Alaska, then down through Canada into Newark.\" The A350-900 ULR (ultra-long-range) that set off on Thursday from Singapore to Newark belongs to Airbus' family of long-range, twin-engine aircraft.   The planes have been designed to replace Boeing's older 777 series and use between 20% and 30% less fuel than the 777s did - which is a good thing amid rising oil prices.  Singapore Airlines launched the same non-stop route between Changi and Newark in 2004, but by 2013 the carrier was forced to cancel it. The A340-500 it was using at the time used a lot of fuel and eventually the route became too expensive to run.  Several carriers already use the newer A350-900s on their long-haul routes. They have higher ceilings, larger windows and lighting designed to reduce jetlag - all good things for busy business travellers.  But the ultra-long-range version that SIA has bought from Airbus has the longest capability of any aircraft flying today, thanks in part to a slightly modified fuel system. It can fly for 20 hours non-stop, which most aviation experts will tell you is the future of very long-haul travel for business and pleasure.  Mr Thomas says it's been proven over and over again that people want to fly non-stop, \"so these sorts of aeroplanes are set to gain terrific momentum\". \"Qantas' flight from Perth to London is seeing a load factor in economy of 92% - and in premium it's 94%. So from an airline perspective, these routes are money-making.  \"We really are entering a new era of travel.\"",

            "text": "A modified Boeing 737 has been used to fight a wildfire for the first time, Australian authorities say. The former passenger jet was deployed as a water-bombing aircraft in New South Wales on Thursday and Friday.  It can carry more than 15,000 litres (4,000 gallons) of water and fire retardant - a large amount, though less than some other water-bombing planes. However, officials say it offers greater flexibility because it can hold up to 63 firefighters in addition. The plane dropped several loads of retardant on a fire that has threatened houses at Port Stephens, 150km (90 miles) north of Sydney. Late on Friday local time, the blaze was not considered an immediate threat to lives. It had burnt through about 1,500 hectares. The 737 was converted into an air tanker by Canadian company Coulson Aviation, and is on contract to the NSW Rural Fire Service.  The fire-fighting agency has nine other water-bombing aircraft, including one with a 45,000-litre capacity. However, spokesman Chris Garlick said the modified 737 was a \"more versatile\" option. \"It's got all the capacity to drop big loads of water and retardant, but because it was a former passenger plane, we can also carry people in it and across interstate lines,\" he told the BBC. Mr Garlick said they were \"stoked\" with how it had performed.  The fire has damaged some minor structures, such as sheds, amid strong winds.  Earlier this week a giant dust storm moved across the state, which has endured months of drought. The state's bushfire season runs from October until April. ",

The aircraft maker is under investigation in the UK and France into its use of middlemen in plane sales. Mr Enders said he saw no reason to resign, but added he would be ready to do so if needed. The Airbus board said last week that it had full confidence in Mr Enders.  The UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and later its French counterpart opened investigations into Airbus after the firm reported itself in 2016. In an interview with German newspaper Handelsblatt, Mr Enders said: \"You can be assured: once I am no longer part of the solution, and I hope I would realise myself when that is, I will draw the consequences [and step down]. \"But for now, I don't think we're at this point,\" he added, according to a pre-released version of the paper's Monday edition. The SFO opened an investigation in August 2016 into allegations of \"fraud, bribery and corruption\" in the civil aviation business of Airbus. The firm, which employs more than 130,000 people globally - including about 10,000 in the UK - asked the regulator to look at documentation about its use of overseas agents. On Friday, Mr Enders said it was \"not impossible that the fine will be significant\" from the UK and French probes. Airbus also faces an investigation in Austria over a \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.8bn) deal struck more than a decade ago for its Eurofighter jet. The firm confirmed in April that Mr Enders was a subject of the Austrian inquiry, adding that the allegations were \"completely unsubstantiated\".",

            "text": "The bosses of EasyJet and Lufthansa have said some airlines may not survive without government support if the coronavirus pandemic drags on. The warnings came just hours after Qantas became the latest major airline to cancel its international flights. At the same time India is reportedly preparing a rescue package to support its carriers.  It comes as airlines around the world are being forced to cancel services as travel demand dries up. \"The longer this crisis lasts, the more likely it is that the future of aviation cannot be guaranteed without state aid,\" said Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr. Lufthansa has already held talks with the German government about providing special loans.  Mr Spohr's comments were echoed by the boss of UK carrier EasyJet, Johan Lundgren, who also warned that airlines could go bankrupt without state aid. \"If you take EasyJet as one of the more stable operators in normal times, if this goes on for an extended period of time you're going to have a lot of failures around the airline industry,\" Mr Lundgren told the BBC's Today programme. \"I have been working in the industry for 30 years and I have never seen anything like this.\" India may be set to join a growing list of governments offering aid to its aviation industry. The Finance Ministry is considering a proposal worth up to $1.6bn (\u00a31.4bn) that includes temporary suspension of most taxes levied on the sector, according to reports. Earlier on Thursday, Qantas became the latest major airline to cancel international flights as it struggles during the pandemic. The carrier said it would send home two-thirds of its 30,000-strong workforce. The Australian flag carrier and its low-cost unit Jetstar will suspend all overseas flights from late March to at least the end of May. \"Demand has evaporated,\" Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said in a note to employees. \"We have no work for most of our people. We have to make difficult decisions to guarantee the future of the national carrier.\" The airline industry is facing its biggest crisis since the September 11 attacks almost two decades ago, with several airlines on the brink of collapse.  \"If you were not financially healthy going into the crisis, then you are very vulnerable now,\" said Greg Waldron at Flight International magazine. \"What we are seeing is unprecedented.\"",

            "text": "The boss of Ethiopian Airlines has called for the grounding of all Boeing's 737 Max 8 aircraft until it is established they are safe to fly. Many countries have already suspended the plane after one of the airline's jets crashed on Sunday minutes after take-off, killing 157 people on board. Tewolde Gebremariam told the BBC that although the exact causes were still unknown, there were similarities to a Lion Air crash last October. But US officials say the jet is safe. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said a review had showed \"no systemic performance issues\" and that there was no basis for grounding the aircraft. Sunday's Nairobi-bound plane was the same type as the Indonesian Lion Air jet that crashed in October, killing 189 passengers and crew, and Mr Tewolde said there were other similarities.  He accepted that Boeing and the FAA must have their reasons for arguing that the 737 Max 8 is safe. But \"extreme precaution\" was needed and \"all of us who have grounded the plane have very good justification,\" Mr Tewolde said. Both aircraft were brand new and in both cases there were problems minutes after take-off, he said. Regulators, including across the European Union, Hong Kong, Singapore, China and Australia, have banned 737 Max aircraft from flying in or over their airspace. Those authorities must have good reason to ground the aircraft, Mr Tewolde said, adding that safety is paramount and \"grounding is the right thing to do\". Meanwhile, a number of US politicians have called on the FAA to temporarily ground the Boeing model until their safety is confirmed. But the FAA said other civil aviation authorities had not \"provided data to us that would warrant action\". Boeing confirmed that it had been developing a \"flight control software enhancement\" for the aircraft, but said it was confident they were safe to fly. The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA union said the 737 MAX fleet should be grounded out of \"an abundance of caution\". The Allied Pilots Association said members who had safety concerns would \"not be forced to fly\". Southwest Airlines and American Airlines, both major operators of the Boeing 737 Max, are continuing to use the planes.  The Boeing 737 Max fleet of aircraft are the latest in the company's successful 737 line. The group includes the Max 7, 8, 9 and 10 models. By the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 of the Max 8 model out of 5,011 orders. A small number of Max 9s are also operating.  The Max 7 and 10 models, not yet delivered, are due for roll-out in the next few years. The Max 8 that crashed on Sunday was one of 30 ordered as part of Ethiopian Airlines' expansion. It underwent a \"rigorous first check maintenance\" on 4 February, the airline said. Following last October's Lion Air crash in Indonesia, investigators said the pilots had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling, a new feature of the jet. It is not yet clear whether the anti-stall system was the cause of Sunday's crash. Aviation experts say other technical issues or human error cannot be discounted. Eyewitnesses say they saw a trail of smoke, sparks and debris as the plane nosedived. Have you been personally affected by this story? Please get in touch with us by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

            "title": "Coronavirus: Tui urges opening up tourism to safer countries",
            "text": "Travel firm Tui is pressing for tourism to resume to countries where the coronavirus threat has abated. It plans to reopen some hotels in Germany \"in the coming days\". The company, which says it has 27 million customers, added operations in other European destinations were also ready to welcome holidaymakers. Tui has identified Austria, Greece and Cyprus as being more viable among European destinations because the virus there appears to be contained. It was forced to cancel the majority of its travel programme in March and on Wednesday warned that up to 8,000 jobs would go as it strives to cut costs by 30% in a major restructuring. TUI has cancelled all holidays until June and cruises until July. It would normally be running hundreds of flights a week at this time of year. Travel restrictions across Europe and further afield mean that the crucial summer season for many though is still in doubt, leaving millions of holidaymakers unsure of their plans. In the UK, the Foreign Office is still advising against all non-essential foreign travel, with no indication of when the policy might change. On Tuesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was unlikely that \"big, lavish international holidays\" were going to be possible this summer. A spokesman for Tui said countries were \"knocking at its door\", eager to see it reopen hotels and bring back tourists.  Tui said it was trying hard to resume operations and had worked out a number of protocols to make its holidays safe. It has a 10-point plan of guidance on how to reopen safely, including limited buffet services, restrictions on some sports and games and longer opening times at restaurants. But the company said blanket travel restrictions were making resumption impossible. Spain, for example, is introducing a 14-day quarantine period for incomers - which covers the length of most package holidays. The issue of holiday travel is becoming politically sensitive as parts of Europe begin to either recover from or emerge as less affected by the first onslaught of the virus. The European Commission said on Wednesday a summer holiday season shouldn't be ruled out this year, contrasting with the UK health secretary's comment on the unlikelihood of a trip abroad this summer.  Tui chief executive Fritz Joussen said: \"The demand for holidays is still very high. People want to travel. \"Our integrated business model allows us to start travel activities as soon as this is possible again. The season starts later, but could last longer.  \"For 2020, we will also reinvent the holiday: new destinations, changed travel seasons, new local offerings, more digitalisation.\" Tui said it was ready to resume providing holidays this year, using new social distancing and cleaning measures. \"The health and well-being of both customers and colleagues remain paramount and we are assessing how we can responsibly adapt to measures so that leisure travel can resume,\" the firm said. \"We are preparing new procedures for the airport process, on board our aircraft, in hotels and on our ships, so that any social distancing recommendations or guidelines can be implemented, without compromising customer enjoyment and travel experience.\" Tui said its restructuring would affect its airline business and would also involve selling off \"non-profitable activities\". \"We are targeting to permanently reduce our overhead cost base by 30% across the entire group. This will have an impact on potentially 8,000 roles globally that will either not be recruited or reduced,\" it said in a statement. Last month it told its UK workforce they would face a cut of up to 50% in hours worked, with a matching cut in basic pay.  The firm said its turnover and earnings would be significantly lower in the current financial year, with cost savings only partly compensating for the slump. Tui, which has a global workforce of 70,000, was recently bolstered by a \u20ac1.8bn (\u00a31.6bn) state-backed loan in Germany, where it has its headquarters.",

            "title": "Boeing admits it 'fell short' on safety alert for 737",
            "text": "Boeing has admitted it \"fell short\" when it failed to implement a safety alert system on the 737 Max. The aircraft was grounded globally in March after two crashes within months. Boeing boss Dennis Muilenburg said a mistake had been made in the software for a cockpit warning light called an \"angle-of-attack (AOA) disagree alert\". He said: \"We clearly fell short and the implementation of this angle-of-attack disagree alert was a mistake, right, we did not implement it properly.\" In an interview with Norah O'Donnell of CBS News he said Boeing was now fixing the problem. The alert could have notified pilots and maintenance crews that there was a problem early in the flight. One flight safety expert said if there had been an AOA disagree alert on board the Ethiopian airlines flight it \"would have been the very first clue\" for the pilots that something was wrong.  Chris Brady, a pilot and author of The Boeing 737 Technical Guide said: \"I'm fairly confident that the Ethiopian Airlines flight probably would not have crashed if they had had the AOA disagree alert\" on the aircraft.  Ethiopian Airlines flight ET 302 crashed after an erroneous reading from one of the AOA sensors triggered a flight control system (MCAS) which repeatedly pushed the nose of the aircraft down.  All 157 people on board were killed. Mr Brady believes that if there had been an alert warning light showing that the AOA sensors were giving different readings, then the pilots might have followed an emergency procedure at an earlier point in the doomed flight.  The procedure, detailed by Boeing in a bulletin to airlines and pilots in November subsequent to the Lion Air crash off Indonesia, involves flipping two switches, and turns off an automatic control system for the plane's stabilisers. Boeing said in a statement a month ago that the \"alert has not been considered a safety feature on airplanes and is not necessary for the safe operation of the airplane\". This is perhaps the clearest admission so far from Boeing that at least one aspect of the aircraft's build wasn't done properly.  We can't say for certain that an angle of attack disagree alert, which was missing, would have made a big difference.  However, it could have provided the pilots with a useful clue, possibly within seconds of take-off, that something was not right.  Ask any pilot if they would have wanted the alert in their cockpit and you'll get a resounding \"yes\".  The alert is about flagging that the readings from the plane's two angle of attack sensors don't match.  And the fact that an erroneous reading from one of those sensors kick-started a flight control system, which pushed the plane's nose repeatedly down before it crashed, means the missing alert will surely be of interest to investigators and lawyers representing relatives of those who were killed.  Mr Muilenburg also admitted in the CBS interview that the company knew that the alert system was not active on all 737 Max jets in 2017 and yet did not tell the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for 13 months.  He said: \"Our communication on that was not what it should have been.\" And he issued another apology, saying \"it feels personal\". He said that the crashes have had \"the biggest impact on me\" of anything in his 34 years at the planemaker. The head of the airline industry's trade body, IATA has said the 737 Max is unlikely to re-enter service before August. Director General Alexandre de Juniac said \"we do not expect something before 10 or 12 weeks\", although he added a final decision was up to regulators. Mr de Juniac told reporters in Seoul on Wednesday that IATA was organising a summit with airlines, regulators and Boeing in five to seven weeks to discuss what is needed for the 737 Max to return to service, he said. He hoped that regulators could \"align their timeframe\" on when the aircraft would  be back in the skies. US operators United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and American Airlines have removed the 737 Max from their flight schedules until early to mid-August. Earlier in the day, Mr Muilenburg had told shareholders Boeing aimed to ramp up its long-term production rate of the 737 Max to 57 a month after cutting monthly output to 42 planes in response to the groundings.",

            "title": "Boeing takes $5bn hit over grounding of 737 Max",
            "text": "Boeing is taking a $4.9bn hit to cover costs related to the global grounding of its 737 Max aircraft. The charge is set to wipe out profits when the world's biggest planemaker posts quarterly results next week. In a statement, Boeing also said its \"best estimate at this time\" is that the aircraft will return to service in the last three months of this year. A 737 Max crash in Indonesia in October, and another in Ethiopia in March, killed 346 people in total. Boeing is facing one of the worst crises in its history after regulators banned its best-selling aircraft from flying after the disasters. Crash investigators have concentrated their efforts on the aircraft's control system and Boeing has been working with regulators to roll out a software upgrade.  The manufacturer, facing intense scrutiny over the regulatory clearance for the aircraft to fly, has cut the monthly production rate from 52 to 42 as airlines hold off purchases.  Most of the $4.9bn charge will be used to compensate Boeing's customers for schedule disruptions and delays in aircraft deliveries. On Friday, Boeing's share price jumped 4% at the start of trading, a sign that investors seem comfortable with the charge. Analysts knew that Boeing faced a heavy financial cost following the disasters and had been awaiting clarity. In April, Boeing halted share buybacks, and said that the grounding of the 737 Max fleet had cost it an additional charge of at least $1bn so far. Theo Leggett, BBC international business correspondent $5bn, and very probably counting. The money set aside by Boeing is meant to cover compensation for customers who either haven't received their aircraft, or can't use the ones they already have. Airlines who are waiting for overdue deliveries are having to make alternative arrangements, by cancelling services, leasing aircraft from specialist companies, or by keeping older, less fuel-efficient models in service for longer. All three options come at a cost. And for those who already had Max aircraft in service, there will be financing costs that still have to be paid, even when the planes themselves are not earning their keep. Not to mention the money that needs to be spent on maintaining them while they are on the ground.  All of this, ultimately, is likely to come back to Boeing. The $5bn figure assumes that the process of approving the Max to go back into service will begin in the autumn. But we have already seen that regulators seem determined to take a very tough line when it comes to ensuring the safety of the aircraft. The schedule could well slip again, and costs rise further. Let's not forget either that lawsuits filed by relatives of accident victims are mounting up, and this charge does not take them into consideration at all. So the final bill for Boeing may well be a lot higher. Boeing chairman and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg, said: \"This is a defining moment for Boeing. Nothing is more important to us than the safety of the flight crews and passengers who fly on our airplanes. \"The Max grounding presents significant headwinds and the financial impact recognised this quarter reflects the current challenges and helps to address future financial risks.\"  Boeing said it continues to work with aviation authorities to get the 737 Max back into the air, which it hopes will be in the fourth quarter of 2019. But the statement added: \"This assumption reflects the company's best estimate at this time, but actual timing of return to service could differ from this estimate.\"  Boeing also warned that if this timetable slips, and its anticipated resumption of deliveries to customers is delayed, that this \"could result in additional financial impact\".    However, in a speech on Thursday, the US transportation secretary appeared less certain that the aircraft would be cleared to fly again this year. Elaine L Chao said the Federal Aviation Administration, \"is following a thorough process, rather than a prescribed timeline... the FAA will lift the aircraft's prohibition order when it is deemed safe to do so.\" She was not referring directly to Boeing's statement. On Thursday, Southwest Airlines, the biggest user of the 737 Max, joined its US rivals in cancelling more flights until early November.  The move also prompted the low-cost carrier to freeze new pilot hiring.",

The airport wants to lengthen the runway by 164m (538ft) to increase the number of flights and allow the use of larger planes. It insists its revised plans include \"significant mitigation\" to noise and environmental impacts. Southampton City Council voted to continue to oppose the extension. Managing director at Southampton Airport Steve Szalay previously said the airport's future would be in doubt if it was not allowed to extend the runway to accommodate planes such as the Airbus 320 and Boeing 737. Local campaigners and Southampton City Council objected to the plans on the grounds of climate change and noise levels. Southampton Airport amended the proposals last year following a number of public consultations. Changes included caps to passenger number growth and increasing the financial compensation for acoustic insulation to nearby households to \u00a35,000. The city council\u00a0had to decide whether additional information\u00a0provided by airport bosses was relevant enough for the plans to be scrutinised again, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. The airport's planning consultant Robin Henderson told the council's Rights of Way Panel: \"We feel that the mitigation is significant and when you balance that against the significant contribution that the airport will continue to make to the economy we believe that balance does fall in favour of the proposed development.\" The panel heard that without the extension, passenger numbers would be one million per year, beneath its break even point of 1.2 million passengers. Despite the changes, the panel voted to uphold its objections. Chair Lisa Mitchell said: \"It has not been very long since we last discussed this and given that it doesn't appear there have been many changes, particularly around the things that we raised when this came to us.\" A final decision on the plan will be made by Eastleigh Borough Council, in whose jurisdiction the airport is situated, although a date is yet to be confirmed.",

            "text": "The French government has abandoned plans to build a huge new terminal at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. The coronavirus pandemic and changing environmental priorities were the reasons given for the move. A fourth terminal would have allowed the airport to handle up to 40 million extra passengers a year. France has radically changed its transport priorities, with airport developments now requiring plans for electric or hydrogen-fuelled planes.  Ecology Minister Barbara Pompili told Le Monde newspaper that the project was now \"obsolete\". \"We will always need planes, but we must move towards a more reasonable use of air travel, and reach a reduction in the sector's greenhouse gas emissions,\" she said. Julien Bayou, head of France's Green Party, said it was \"a great victory for environmentalists\" against what he called \"an idiotic project\". Charles de Gaulle airport, which opened in 1974, is the second busiest airport in Europe after London Heathrow, with more than 76 million passengers passing through in 2019. First announced three years ago and with building work set to begin in the months ahead, Terminal 4 was described as an airport within an airport - the equivalent of putting Paris's second airport Orly inside Charles de Gaulle.    By the end of the 2030s it was projected to handle 450 extra flights at the airport every day.  But since approval, two things have happened.   First, in order to respect carbon emission targets, the government now says any airport development must accommodate electric and hydrogen-fuelled planes of the future.  The second change is Covid. With air traffic today just a quarter of its pre-crisis levels, mammoth expansion schemes like Terminal 4 appear distinctly irrelevant.",

            "text": "The US has said it will hold off an a threatened hike in tariffs on $7.5bn (\u00a35.75bn) worth of European and UK goods that it imposed as punishment for subsidies for plane-maker Airbus. The move comes as the two sides wrestle to put to an end their 16-year trade battle over state aid for Airbus and American rival Boeing. The US last year raised border taxes on more than 100 items, including jumpers, single-malt whiskies and cheese. It has said the EU has not done enough. \"The EU and member states have not taken the actions necessary to come into compliance with WTO decisions,\" America's top trade official, Robert Lighthizer, said on Wednesday.  \"The United States, however, is committed to obtaining a long-term resolution to this dispute.  The European Union cautiously welcomed the US decision not to increase the amount of goods subject to tariffs. \"The commission acknowledges the decision of the US not to exacerbate the ongoing aircraft dispute by increasing tariffs on European products,\" an EU spokesperson said. Airbus last month said it would alter some deals responsible for the dispute, saying the changes, including increasing its interest rates on loans with France and Spain, eliminated \"any justification\" for the US border taxes. The move prompted EU officials to call for an end to \"unjustified\" tariffs. Many American businesses have also protested the duties, which raise prices for American buyers. On Wednesday Airbus spokesman Clay McConnell said in a statement the company \"profoundly regrets that, despite Europe's recent actions to achieve full compliance, USTR [US Trade Representative] has decided to maintain tariffs on Airbus aircraft - especially at a time when aviation and other sectors are going through an unprecedented crisis.\" The US announced tariffs on $7.5bn worth of goods last year after the World Trade Organization ruled that state aid provided to Airbus to launch its A380 and A350 jets was illegal and authorised American retaliation.  In February, the US raised the rates being charged on aircraft from 10% to 15%, leaving the 25% duty on other items unchanged. This summer, American officials again threatened to raise tariff rates or make new items subject to the import tax. The items threatened with new duties included salmon fillets, gin and olives. The US is required by law to review the tariffs periodically. On Wednesday it announced minor tweaks to the list, for example, removing sweet biscuits like shortbread made in the UK and adding jams from France and Germany. Trade lawyer Jamieson Greer, former chief of staff to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, told the BBC: \"The reality is that this can all be solved if Airbus took some action to provide restitution.\" The European Union, which brought its own case challenging American subsidies for Boeing, has threatened to hit the US with tariffs of its own. It is waiting for the World Trade Organization to decide how big such a punishment might be.  The US in May said it had eliminated the benefits in dispute. That WTO ruling is expected later this year.  \"In the absence of a settlement, the EU will be ready to fully avail itself of its own sanction rights,\" Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said last month. The issue has also complicated trade talks between the US and the UK. UK Trade Secretary Liz Truss raised the matter in talks with Mr Lighthizer this month, as the two sides held a third round of negotiations. Ms Truss said that while she welcomed the US's decision not to lift levies: \"The announcement does not address tariffs that already exist on goods like single malt Scotch whisky.\"  She said: \"These tariffs damage industry and livelihoods on both sides of the Atlantic and are in nobody's interests. I am therefore stepping up talks with the US to remove them as soon as possible.\"",

            "text": "Survivors and relatives of some of the 47 people killed in one of the worst British air disasters have gathered for a service to remember the dead.  A Boeing 737, carrying 126 people, crashed on to the M1 in Leicestershire on 8 January 1989.    Witnesses described the \"devastation\" as the plane plunged into the embankment and smashed into pieces. Reverend Lauretta Wilson said the \"fateful night\" had never been forgotten in Kegworth. British Midland flight 92 had been diverted to East Midlands Airport after leaving Heathrow for Belfast when one of the plane's engines caught fire.  The pilots then mistakenly switched off the wrong engine on the way to the airport. Witnesses said the plane \"bounced\" over the motorway, hit the central reservation and crashed into the embankment. About 150 people attended the service at St Andrew's Church in the village, where floral tributes were laid outside. Opening the commemorations at the 30th anniversary service, Reverend Wilson said: \"Kegworth has never forgotten that fateful night on January 8 1989.  \"Whatever our motivations, it is good to have the opportunity to remember and honour those who lost their lives.  \"The dreadful event shook all of our communities.\"  Wreaths and flowers have also been placed at Kegworth Cemetery to remember those who died. Members of the emergency services, who were first at the scene when the aircraft crashed, also attended. Leslie Bloomer, 57, was on his way home having visited the London Boat Show with his friends, Mervyn Finlay and Desmond Clarke, who also survived. \"We shouldn't have even been on that flight. We got to Heathrow early and I changed the flights from 21:20 to 19:20 BST,\" he said. Describing the crash, he added: \"We could see small bits of debris, sparks coming out of the left-hand engine. \"You could feel [the plane] wavering as the pilot struggled to keep it straight and then it thumped on the ground with an awful bang. \"When it came to a halt I suddenly realised 'I'm sitting here alive'\u2026 There was a hole at the side of the plane which I started to clamber out through.  \"This guy came walking up and just grabbed me and carried me down the banking.\" Physiotherapist Helen Esplen, who was 25 in 1989, was travelling home on the M1 following a holiday when the plane crashed. She was one of the first people at the scene and managed to get to the cockpit where Captain Kevin Hunt and co-pilot David McClelland were trapped.  Mrs Esplen helped to save the life of Mr McClelland, spending two hours keeping him conscious. She said: \"Every time he shut his eyes I kept talking to him; he would have known so much about my life. Later, he wrote a lovely letter thanking me.\" Once the pilots were freed from the cockpit she was passed through the fuselage to help trapped passengers. She attended two teenage boys, one of whom died. The other she believes may have been Stephen McCoy.  \"I was used to seeing trauma and blood, it was a matter of life and death, and hopefully I saved lives,\" she said. She received a Royal Humane Society award for her actions. A lifeboat crew, from Withernsea, Yorkshire, were travelling back from a training exercise when they saw the plane coming down.  Barry Bingham, who with his colleagues helped with the rescue, said \"A lot of sparks came out from the engines and that was the point where one of them blew up.  \"The wreckage was in three parts. There were flames coming up from the engine.\" Mr Bingham said the only person they saw \"was a chap who was wandering around the motorway in a uniform\".  \"It was only later I realised it was a steward out of the aeroplane, he fell out the back,\" he added.

            "title": "ViaSat-2: Satellite goliath goes into orbit",
            "text": "The most powerful commercial broadband satellite ever built has just gone into orbit on an Ariane rocket. ViaSat-2, which is to be stationed above the Americas, has a total throughput capacity of about 300 gigabits per second.  The spacecraft was part of a dual payload on the Ariane flight. It was joined by Eutelsat 172B, a UK/French-built platform to go over the Pacific.  Both satellites will be chasing the rampant market for wi-fi on aeroplanes.  Airlines are currently in a headlong rush to equip their fleets with connections that will allow passengers to use their mobile devices in mid-air.  More than 6,000 commercial aircraft worldwide were offering an onboard wi-fi service in 2016; it is expected more than 17,000 will be doing so by 2021.  In-flight internet has traditionally had a terrible reputation, but there is a feeling now that the latest technology really can give passengers a meaningful slice of bandwidth and at a competitive price.  Inmarsat rides SpaceX Falcon Intelsat rolls out next-gen system The Ariane left the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana at 20:45 local time, Thursday (23:45 GMT), ejecting the satellites into their transfer orbits about half an hour later.  Both must now get themselves into their final positions. Noteworthy is the fact that ViaSat-2 and 172B will be using electric engines to do this.  These work by accelerating and expelling ions at high speed. The process provides less thrust than a standard chemical engine, but saves substantially on propellant mass.  That saving can be traded to get either a lower-priced launch ticket, or to pack even greater capacity into the satellite's communications payload for no additional weight.  The US, Boeing-built ViaSat-2 uses a mix of chemical and electric propulsion, but Eutelsat's platform is all-electric - the first such design to come from Europe's biggest space manufacturer, Airbus.  ViaSat-2 will be providing broadband services to fixed customers across North America, Central America, the Caribbean, and a portion of northern South America.  But the satellite is also configured to service planes and ships, and in particular it is looking to grab a significant share of business out over the Atlantic.  The aviation sector currently is a key battleground for satellite operators; it is where they are seeing double-digit growth.  In the US, working with airlines such as JetBlue, ViaSat has already found success through its existing high-throughput ViaSat-1 spacecraft.  With the extra capacity on ViaSat-2, it aims to do better still.  \"We think people want to use their devices in the air the way they do on the ground; that's the bet we've made,\" said ViaSat Chief Operating Officer Rick Baldridge.  \"JetBlue delayed their in-flight wi-fi offering, waiting for us, and now they're giving it away for free and we're providing 12 megabits per second to every seat, including streaming video,\" he told BBC News.  ViaSat-2's \"footprint\" touches the western coast of Europe, but aeroplanes travelling further east will be handed seamlessly to a better-positioned Eutelsat spacecraft, which should enable passengers to stay connected all the way across to Turkey if needs be.  This is one of the benefits of the strategic alliance that the two satellite companies have formed. And in time this will see the pair operate a ViaSat-3 platform together over Europe. This spacecraft is being built to have a total throughput capacity of one terabit per second.  From its position very close to the International Date Line, Eutelsat's 172B spacecraft is going to target - amongst other business - the flight corridors of the Asia-Pacific region. And it has some very smart British technology to do this in the form of a multi port amplifier.  This can flexibly switch power between the satellite's 11 spot beams to make sure the available bandwidth is always focused where it is needed most - whether that be on the planes moving east-west from Japan to California, say, or when they go in the other direction as a cluster at a different time of day.  \"To oversimplify, in-flight connectivity has mostly been restricted to the US. But now it is expanding into the Asia-Pacific region and it's also coming to Europe,\" said Rodolphe Belmer, Eutelsat's chief executive officer. \"We see spontaneous demand from airlines and it's booming. It's true the technology hasn't always delivered, but you will see with the introduction of very high throughput satellites in the next few years that we will be able to\u2026 bring a massive quantity of bandwidth onboard the plane, meaning you can stream Netflix in HD. That's a game-changer.\"  Euroconsult is one of the world's leading analyst groups following the satellite industry. Its research confirms the rapid growth now taking place, and says this will only accelerate.  Euroconsult's recent report on in-flight-connectivity (IFC) predicted nearly half of all commercial planes would be enabled by 2021, pushing revenues for the suppliers of onboard services from $1bn to $6.5bn inside 10 years. But Euroconsult's CEO, Pac\u00f4me Revillon, said there will be winners and losers in this IFC race and this would likely be decided in the very near future.  \"Going to 2020, approximately 50% of aircraft could have opted for their chosen connectivity solutions, and certainly all of the major airlines will have made that choice. By that stage the market share could decide who are the winners and losers, and we anticipate seeing some consolidation in this sector, with two to three companies coming to dominate the market,\" he told BBC News.

            "text": "EU aviation regulators have scheduled flight tests for Boeing's troubled 737 Max plane. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said the tests would take place in Vancouver, Canada in the week beginning 7 September. Boeing's best-selling aircraft was grounded last year after two crashes killed all 346 people on the flights. The announcement comes two months after US regulators began similar test flights for the jet. However, EASA has maintained that clearance by the US Federal Aviation Administration will not automatically mean a clearance to fly in Europe. The agency said it had been \"working steadily, in close co-operation with the FAA and Boeing, to return the Boeing 737 Max aircraft to service as soon as possible, but only once it is convinced it is safe\". It said the process of scheduling the test flights had been hindered by Covid-19 travel restrictions between Europe and the US It added: \"While Boeing still has some final actions to close off, EASA judges the overall maturity of the re-design process is now sufficient to proceed to flight tests. These are a prerequisite for the European agency to approve the aircraft's new design.\" EASA said simulator tests would take place from 1 September at London's Gatwick airport. Meanwhile, the FAA has put forward a wide-ranging list of changes it wants to be made before the planes can fly again commercially. These include updating flight control software, revising crew procedures and rerouting internal wiring. Boeing hopes to get the 737 Max back in the air early next year. Aviation regulators grounded the 737 Max following two crashes - a Lion Air flight and an Ethiopian Airlines flight - within five months of each other.  The crashes killed all 346 passengers and crew on the flights. The ruling triggered a financial crisis at the 103-year-old company, sparked lawsuits from victims' families and raised questions about how Boeing and the FAA conducted their safety approval process. Investigators blamed faults in the flight control system, which Boeing has been overhauling for months in order to meet new safety demands.",

            "title": "Afghanistan: Striking image captures Kabul exodus",
            "text": "It's one of the most striking images from the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban. Hundreds of Afghans packed into a US military cargo plane as they flee Kabul.  The faces, many male but with some women and children, look up towards the camera, their expressions a mixture of anxiety and possibly some relief.  The image was initially obtained by the US defence analysis website, Defense One, but was released by the US Air Mobility Command public affairs office on Tuesday. On Sunday, panicked civilians had scrambled up the loading ramp, Defense One quoted a US official as saying, but the crew decided it was best to take off rather than force the Afghans off the plane.  The number onboard - 640 - is among the highest carried by that type of plane, a C-17 Globemaster.  It's approaching, though still some way off, the record for the number of people transported by any plane - an Israeli Boeing 747 carrying more than 1,000 Jewish migrants from Ethiopia in 1991. The US defence official quoted by Defense One, says the flight from Kabul to Qatar was one of several which managed to extract hundreds of Afghans from Kabul.  The photo stands in contrast to the chaotic images which emerged from Kabul airport on Monday as it was overrun by Afghans terrified at the prospect of Taliban rule. US soldiers struggled to keep control.  An image of the same type of plane from Monday showed hundreds of Afghans running alongside the moving aircraft, some clinging to the side. Local media reports said at least two fell to their deaths once it took off.  Some have questioned why it is predominantly men seen at the airport.  One explanation is that many women have been staying indoors, fearing how they will be treated by the Taliban.  Another is that many families would want their men to leave first so they can help from outside Afghanistan, financially, and eventually find a way to bring their loved ones out of the country.  While the airlifts will be welcomed by many, the numbers could be a drop in the ocean of those who feel compelled to leave in fear of the Taliban.  The UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, has called on countries not to force the return of Afghans previously deemed not to need protection.   It estimates 550,000 Afghans have been internally displaced by the conflict since the beginning of the year.  Between 20,000 and 30,000 are thought to be fleeing across borders every week, the UNHCR's Afghanistan representative, Caroline Van Buren, told CNN. And government figures suggest 120,000 moved to Kabul as Taliban forces closed in. Many of those in fear for their lives have worked with US-led forces, notably as translators or contractors. But the Taliban's treatment of women during its previous rule in the 1990s and its use of barbaric punishments is another major spur to leave.  At the beginning of August, the White House announced a plan to allow thousands of Afghans with links to the US to resettle there. On Monday, President Joe Biden announced $500m (\u00a3362m) in aid for Afghan refugees.  The US has relocated some 2,000 Afghans out of the country under its Special Immigrant Visa scheme, officials say, and plans to transport thousands more.  Other countries are helping out too, including Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel told party leaders that Germany may need to evacuate some 10,000 people, including 2,500 support staff.  UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC Breakfast that 150 British nationals were flown out on Sunday.  Last week, the UK extracted 289 Afghans. Several hundred more will leave in the next 24 hours, he said.  But the turmoil in Afghanistan has raised fears in Europe of a new influx of migrants. A stark illustration is Turkey's decision to boost security at its lengthy border with Iran where Turkey is building a concrete wall.   Have you or a loved one been evacuated from Afghanistan?

            "text": "Boeing needs to pay more heed to how pilots react to emergencies in its safety assessment of the 737 Max plane, US transport chiefs have said. The 737 Max has been grounded since March following two fatal crashes.  The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) must decide if the plane is safe. But according to the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the crews in the fatal crashes \"did not react in the ways Boeing and the FAA assumed they would\". The 737 Max plane has not flown commercially since an Ethiopian Airlines aircraft crashed shortly after take-off on 10 March, killing 157.  It followed a Lion Air crash on 28 October last year which killed 189. In both incidents, investigators have focused on the role played by a software system called MCAS (Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System), which was designed to make the aircraft easier to fly.  Inquiries have shown the software - and the failure of sensors - contributed to pilots not being able to control the aircraft. Boeing has said it is revising the plane's software to improve safeguards. But the director of the NTSB's Office of Aviation Safety, Dana Schulze, said Boeing \"did not look at all potential flight deck alerts and indications that pilots might face when this specific failure condition occurred in Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines\". Earlier this month, Europe's aviation safety watchdog, the European Aviation Safety Agency (Easa), said it would not accept a US verdict on whether the 737 Max was safe. Instead, it will run its own tests on the plane before approving a return to commercial flights. \"I think the crew were just overloaded with information\". This was what a pilot in Ethiopia told me earlier this year when we were discussing the 737 Max that crashed near Addis Ababa. The NTSB's recommendations seem to bear out that theory. It says that during simulator tests, Boeing assessed pilot responses to a generic MCAS failure. But it did not incorporate the kinds of problems that could lead up to such a failure. This meant that when the real thing happened, pilots were faced with a variety of alerts and warnings that had not occurred in the simulator - linked to the sensor failure that caused MCAS to deploy at the wrong time.  As a result they did not respond in the way Boeing had assumed they would, and did not immediately take the steps it had assumed they would take.  Given that those assumptions underpinned the manufacturer's own safety analysis, it is a worrying conclusion, and potentially one with wider implications. ",

            "text": "Cathay Pacific has announced immediate major cuts to its flight schedule, including cancelling passenger and cargo services to and from Hong Kong. The airline did not provide details on how many flights would be grounded but it said it would operate a skeleton passenger schedule in January. It comes after Hong Kong announced tighter Covid-19 quarantine rules for air cargo crew earlier this week. The move was aimed at tackling the threat of the Omicron Covid variant. Cathay pilots have previously told the BBC the restrictions have affected their mental health and personal lives. Late on Thursday Cathay Pacific said it was tentatively planning to cancel some passenger flights in and out of the Asian financial hub in the first three months of the new year. It also said that long haul freight and cargo-only passenger flights including from Europe, Riyadh and Dubai would be suspended until 6 January. Cathay Pacific had already announced last week that it would cancel some of its flights in January. The latest decision is likely to put further strain on the already struggling global supply chain. Like much of the rest of the global aviation industry, Cathay has been hit hard by the pandemic. It posted a net loss of $2.8bn (\u00a32bn) in 2020 and lost $972m in the first half of 2021. Airlines around the world have cancelled thousands of flights in the Christmas period alone due to the coronavirus. In line with mainland China, Hong Kong has a zero-Covid policy as it aims to persuade Beijing to allow cross-border travel. As a result the city has some of strictest quarantine rules in the world, raising concerns that it may be left behind as other major financial centres open up as they adopt approaches that see them live with the coronavirus rather than remaining closed off to keep case numbers low. Hong Kong is one of the world's biggest aviation hubs but also has some of the strictest coronavirus regulations in the world. Two pilots with Cathay Pacific recently told the BBC that the rules have seriously affected their mental health and putting a strain on their personal lives.   \"You're just in a perpetual state of quarantine,\" one pilot, who has spent almost 150 days in isolation this year alone, said. Though Hong Kong has recorded barely any local coronavirus cases in recent months, the city has imposed an extensive testing and quarantine regime, in line with mainland China's zero Covid policy.

            "title": "How can Boeing regain trust?",
            "text": "Boeing's boss has admitted that a failure in its 737 Max jet's anti-stall system, MCAS, was a factor in last month's Ethiopian Airlines crash. That disaster, and a Lion Air 737 Max crash in Indonesia five months ago, left a total of 346 dead.  Boeing is working on changes to the MCAS system to restore trust. However, apart from talk of cancelled orders from some carriers, airlines have, so far, stuck with the plane and 5,000 orders remain on Boeing's books. We spoke to three analysts to see whether they thought the aviation giant can reassure customers, both airlines and passengers, that its plane is safe.  Peter Morris, chief economist, aviation consultancy, Ascend  I think you have here the fundamentals of the \"rolling unravelling\" of a strong Boeing brand. Boeing's strength was built up over decades, but it meant many made the mistake of regarding the first incident [Lion Air] as a \"one-off\". When it became \"two-off\" on a fleet of just over 350 aircraft, which were also a new variant and a 4th generation design of an aircraft that had design roots in the 1960s, the alarm bells sounded.  Boeing has several groups it needs to convince.  Global regulatory authorities used to accept the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) certification, but it is now unlikely to be waved through with the same trust bearing in mind the FAA was so behind the rest in grounding the aircraft.  Boeing will have to deal with at least four separate regulatory authorities as it seeks to return the aircraft to service safely.  Airline customers are unlikely as yet to cancel current orders - although at the very least the market for Max aircraft is likely to soften for a while. There's a further cost to consider, as carriers awaiting aircraft and having to put emergency plans in place are going to seek financial compensation. Then there are the human elements. The pilots and crew understand far more of the deep technical issues and will be understandably vociferous about the absolute integrity of the revised hardware, software and procedures. In the light of the evidence to date, they are likely to be very critical and need significant reassurance and explanation. While many passengers probably do not recognise their aircraft type, events like this inevitably get people talking. Any further incidents, even if slightly related to these issues, would be utterly disastrous for public opinion and really shake trust in aviation safety.  But in the long term, given there are more than 14,000 single-aisle aircraft in service globally and half of these are Boeings, it is hard to see a scenario where the Max is not returned safely to service and in the long run accepted by the travelling public as a safe aircraft. Compensation is going to be significant factor, and the sums involved are likely to be eye watering. John Strickland, director of aviation consultancy, JLS Consulting Boeing has a big reputational challenge, although to put it in context the company is well over 100 years old and is one of only two big suppliers [with Airbus] known for producing safe and dependable aircraft.  It has to restore the trust of airline customers and the public but I think its customers will still be confident that safety can be restored. It is actually difficult to cancel an order, there are cost penalties and there are only two companies in this market. Airlines build their fleets around one brand of plane, it makes sense in terms of parts supplies and the specialist training for engineers and pilots.  Not only that, both Airbus and Boeing have packed order books, so switching to the other company just delays delivery of the new planes. For the passengers? We're emotional beings. I've had friends around me asking whether I'll be flying on a Max. Mostly people simply don't know what they're flying on and don't really care. When I ask people 'what did you fly on?' - most don't even know if it's an Airbus or a Boeing. This though will sharpen people's attention, for the short term at least. These incidents do fade from the memory. Back in the 1970s there was an aircraft, the McDonnell Douglas DC10 which had a couple of unrelated bad accidents. However, that plane went on to have a safe and reliable career. The other constituents that need reassurance are pilots, after all, they're the ones with the responsibility for safety in their hands. So Boeing has to go out with clear messages of explanation and assurance. Marc Szepan, lecturer in international business at the University of Oxford Sa\u00efd Business School and former aviation executive There is an old saying in the aviation industry that illustrates how airlines tend to look at aircraft and engine manufacturers: \"You sell (engine) thrust, we buy trust!\"  Throughout Boeing's history there has been a strong commitment to safety. In the spirit of this tradition, Boeing - in co-operation with regulatory authorities and the airline community - should focus on identifying the root cause or causes of the recent 737 Max accidents and then put in place well tested substantial solutions rather than premature \"symbolic\" band-aids. Boeing needs to be aware of the disconnect between the speed of modern day social media-driven news cycles on the one hand and the significant time a thorough root-cause analysis requires on the other.  So it is important for Boeing to communicate candidly and honestly - and empathetically - both with airlines and passengers as the accident investigation and product improvement process moves along.  The video statement by Boeing's chief executive is a good step in that direction.",

Birmingham Airport called the move \"disappointing\" and said it was trying to restore the schedule. The change affecting four regular services is a result of closures to Pakistan airspace, the airline says. Pakistan airspace was restricted after air strikes by the Indian military.  The suspended services are: AI113 Delhi-Birmingham; AI114 Birmingham-Delhi; AI117 Delhi-Amritsar-Birmingham; and AI118 Birmingham-Amritsar-Delhi. Before the change, Air India flew from Birmingham six times a week. The airline said its four daily flights through London Heathrow were unaffected, but its Madrid flights were suspended. On Twitter, the airline said it regretted \"the inconvenience caused to our valued passengers\" and suggested they would be entitled to a full refund. UK and Europe regional manager Debashis Golder added: \"The flight cancellation is due to extraordinary circumstances namely closure of Pakistan airspace and resultant impact which is beyond control of Air India. \"In fact besides Birmingham, many other flights in our network have been cancelled, combined or being operated with restricted payload, to reduce impact on passenger travel to the minimum.\" One passenger took to Twitter to say the suspended flights were a \"huge blow to Birmingham Airport\". An airport spokeswoman said: \"It is naturally disappointing that Air India is temporarily suspending its services from Birmingham Airport to Delhi and Amritsar from 16 March 2019. \"The airport is very understanding of the current situation which means that Pakistan airspace cannot be overflown and the operational impact that this is having on Air India. \"Passengers that are already booked on Air India flights from Birmingham will be contacted by the airline to re-book or to gain a refund. \"We are working closely with Air India to restore these flights to Birmingham Airport's schedule as soon as possible.\" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, and sign up for local news updates direct to your phone",

            "text": "Protesters who broke into Stansted Airport to stop a plane deporting people to Africa have won an appeal against their convictions. The group, known as the Stansted 15, cut through the perimeter fence and locked themselves together around a Boeing 767 jet in 2017. They were convicted of the intentional disruption of services at an aerodrome. The Lord Chief Justice said they \"should not have been prosecuted for the extremely serious offence\". A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: \"We will consider the judgment carefully in the next 28 days.\" The jet they surrounded in March 2017 had been chartered by the Home Office to transport people from UK detention centres for repatriation to Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone. The protesters put their arms inside pipes which were then filled with expandable foam, and secured themselves around the nose wheel and wing of the aircraft, the court was told during their trial. They were convicted under the Aviation and Maritime Security Act (Amsa) 1990. In February 2019, three were given suspended jail sentences, and the other 12 were handed community orders. Sitting with Mr Justice Jay and Mrs Justice Whipple, Lord Burnett said the protesters' \"conduct did not satisfy the various elements of the offence\". \"There was, in truth, no case to answer,\" he said. \"We recognise that the various summary-only offences with which the appellants were originally charged, if proved, might well not reflect the gravity of their actions. \"That, however, does not allow the use of an offence which aims at conduct of a different nature. \"All the appellants' convictions must be quashed.\" At the appeal hearing in November, lawyers for the activists argued the legislation used to convict the 15 is rarely used and not intended for this type of case. The Stansted 15's barristers argued that the Amsa law is intended to deal with violence of the \"utmost seriousness\", such as terrorism, not demonstrators. Lord Burnett said in the judgement that it could not be established on the evidence in the case that the group's actions caused disruption which was \"likely to endanger\" the safe operation of the airport or the safety of people there. After the judgment was published, one of the protesters, Lyndsay Burtonshaw, tweeted: \"We got the judgement from our appeal for our terrorism-related conviction for the #Stansted15 action. WE WON!\"  The Court of Appeal's judgment in favour of the 15 underlines a fundamental safeguard in the law: You can only be prosecuted for something you've actually done - and that means the evidence has to fit the wording of the offence.  The crime the 15 were charged with had its genesis in the need to protect airports from terrorism - yet the prosecution didn't suggest at the trial that the incident was remotely that kind of attack.  And the protesters insisted that despite their plan to stop the flight, they never intended to do anything that was likely to endanger safety at the airport. The three senior judges agreed that this critical test had not been met and so the prosecution was unjustified. The 15 may have created a health-and-safety risk by going onto the airport tarmac - but that was well below a genuinely dangerous situation that would have justified charging them with this very serious offence.  In a statement on behalf of the group, May MacKeith, one of the protesters, said: \"The nightmare of this bogus charge, a 10-week trial and the threat of prison has dominated our lives for four years. \"Despite the draconian response we know our actions were justified. \"Eleven people, including survivors of trafficking, who would have been deported that night are still in the UK. \"Mothers, fathers, colleagues, friends and family members are rebuilding lives the Government attempted to destroy.\" The 15 are: Helen Brewer, 31; Lyndsay Burtonshaw, 30; Nathan Clack, 32; Laura Clayson, 30; Melanie Evans, 37; Joseph McGahan, 37; Benjamin Smoke, 29; Jyotsna Ram, 35; Nicholas Sigsworth, 31; Melanie Strickland, 37; Alistair Tamlit, 32; Edward Thacker, 31; Emma Hughes, 40; May MacKeith, 35; and Ruth Potts, 46.

            "title": "5G phones: How serious is the threat to US flights?",
            "text": "US mobile networks AT&T and Verizon have agreed to postpone the expansion of their 5G service at some airports. The service was due to start operating in more places on Wednesday after two earlier delays. But ten leading US airlines say the new technology could cause thousands of flights to be delayed.  5G is the next generation of mobile internet connection. It lets people download and upload data much more quickly, and allows more devices to access the mobile internet at the same time. To do this, it relies on greater use of radio signals. In the US, the radio frequencies being used for 5G are in part of the spectrum known as C-Band.  These frequencies are close to the ones used by radio altimeters on aeroplanes, which measure the height of the aircraft above the ground, and also provide data for safety and navigation systems.  The concern is that interference from 5G transmissions could stop these instruments from working properly, and cause safety problems, particularly when aircraft are coming in to land. It is potentially very serious.  In late 2020, the RTCA - a US organisation which produces technical guidance on aviation issues - published a report warning of the possibility of \"catastrophic failures leading to multiple fatalities, in the absence of appropriate mitigations\". More recently, the US aviation regulator, the FAA, warned that 5G interference could lead to problems with a number of different systems aboard Boeing's 787 Dreamliner.  These could make it difficult to slow the plane down on landing, causing it to veer off the runway. Planes won't be allowed to use radio altimeters in circumstances where there could be a risk of serious interference.  But that will restrict the ability of some aircraft to land, for example, in poor visibility.  Airlines for America, which represents ten major carriers, has warned that this could lead to more than 1,000 flights being delayed or cancelled in bad weather and mean at times \"the vast majority of the travelling and shipping public will essentially be grounded\".  It has also suggested a large part of the US aircraft fleet will be \"deemed unusable\" because of restrictions on their operation. Not to the same degree. That's because the way in which 5G is being rolled out varies from country to country.  In the EU, for example, networks operate at lower frequencies than those which US providers are planning to use - reducing the risk of interference. 5G masts can also operate at lower power.  Nevertheless, some countries have taken further steps to reduce possible risks.  In France, there are so-called \"buffer zones\" around airports where 5G signals are restricted, while antennas have to be tilted downwards to prevent potential interference. Regulators in the US have already taken a number of steps.  The FAA has established temporary buffer zones around 50 airports, where 5G providers will limit their activities. But these are much smaller than the zones already being used in France, and US transmitters will operate at significantly higher power levels.  It has also begun identifying which altimeters can be used safely in areas where 5G has been deployed - and those which are not reliable enough and will need to be replaced.  It has also identified airports where GPS systems can be used to guide approaching aircraft rather than radio altimeters.  But the airlines insist this isn't enough: they claim the 5G network should not be activated at all within two miles of affected airports. Verizon and AT&T have agreed to \"temporarily\" delay the rollout of 5G at what AT&T said was a \"limited number of towers around certain airport runways\".  Some 5G masts won't be switched on while talks continue to find a permanent solution.  This should reduce the possibility of interference with onboard systems. In a statement, President Biden said the delay would only affect about 10% of the masts involved in the expansion of 5G. The firms had already postponed the 5G rollout twice, and had agreed to the temporary buffer zones mentioned above.  Both companies expressed their frustration at the latest hold-up. AT&T said regulators had had two years to plan for the start of 5G service.  They also pointed out that 5G has already been implemented in some 40 countries. Last month the US wireless industry body CTIA accused the aviation industry of \"scaremongering\", and warned that delaying the introduction of 5G would cause real economic harm. UK regulators and airlines do not seem unduly worried.  In a safety notice published in December, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said that \"there have been no confirmed instances where 5G interference has resulted in aircraft system malfunction or unexpected behaviour\".  It also stressed that \"different national mobile telecommunication strategies may mean that some [countries] have a higher threat exposure than others\".  The UK regulator says it plans to work internationally to gather further data on the issue.",

            "text": "More than 100 people have died after a Boeing 737 airliner crashed near Cuba's main airport in Havana, the country's worst air disaster in decades. Three women were pulled alive from the wreckage, but are said to be in a critical condition.  The plane, which was nearly 40 years old, was carrying 105 passengers and six crew members. Cuban authorities have launched an investigation, and two days of national mourning have been declared. The Boeing 737-201 crashed at 12:08 (16:08 GMT) on Friday, shortly after taking off from Havana on an internal flight to Holguin on the east of the island. All six crew members on board were Mexican and the majority of the passengers were Cuban, with five foreigners reported to be among them. \"There has been an unfortunate aviation accident. The news is not very promising, it seems that there is a high number of victims,\" Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said after visiting the crash site. It's too early to say what caused the crash, but eyewitnesses on the ground describe seeing the jet burst into flames before crashing into a field close to a wooded area near Havana's main airport. \"I saw it taking off,\" supermarket worker Jose Luis told the AFP news agency. \"All of a sudden, it made a turn, and went down. We were all amazed.\" \"We heard an explosion and then saw a big cloud of smoke go up,\" Gilberto Menendez, who runs a restaurant near the crash site, told Reuters. Mexico's transport department said on its website that \"during take-off (the plane) apparently suffered a problem and dived to the ground\". Boeing said that it was ready to send a technical team to Cuba, \"as permitted under US law and at the direction of the US National Transportation Safety Board and Cuban authorities\". A US trade embargo has been in force against Cuba for many decades. Four people survived the crash but one died after being transported to hospital, the director of Havana's Calixto Garcia hospital, Carlos Alberto Martinez, told Reuters. The three survivors are all women, according to Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma: one aged between 18 and 25, one in her thirties and the third aged 39.  \"She is alive but very burnt,\" one of the women's relatives at the hospital told Reuters. Both the Argentine and Mexican governments have confirmed nationals from their countries were among the dead. The plane had been leased to state airline Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n by the Mexican company Aerolineas Damojh. The Mexican authorities said the plane was built in 1979 and had been successfully inspected last November. Mexico has said it was sending two civil aviation specialists to join the investigation. Aerolineas Damojh, also known as Global Air, has three planes in operation. According to industry research, last year was the safest in history for commercial airline travel with no passenger jet crashes. But there have been several serious air disasters this year. Cuba's deadliest air crash was in 1989, when a Soviet-made Ilyushin-62M passenger plane crashed near Havana killing 126 people on board and another 24 people on the ground.",

            "text": "A wing-walking display plane crashed into the sea at an air show after an oil pipe failure caused a complete loss of power, investigators have found. The Boeing A75N1 (PT17) Stearman biplane came down and flipped in Poole Harbour during the Bournemouth Air Festival in September 2021. Pilot David Barrell and wing-walker Kirsten Pobjoy escaped with minor injuries. The Cirencester-based duo returned to the event this year. The pair had been taking part in a display during the third day of the show off Bournemouth Beach last year when the AeroSuperBatics biplane developed engine trouble. Noticing a loss of power, the pair aborted their performance and flew westwards before ditching into the sea near Sandbanks. Witnesses praised Mr Barrell for an \"incredible feat of flying\" in bringing the plane down. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) found a metal strap supporting the oil pipe failed, preventing oil reaching the engine. \"The fatigue failure was initiated at an area of mechanical damage on the surface of the support strap, which had been caused by over-tightening of the retaining nut,\" it added. As a result of the crash, the AAIB said the operator had initiated new hand signals between pilot and wing-walker to warn of oil or fuel leaks, or an impending ditching. Mr Barrell and Ms Pobjoy returned to make a successful appearance at the 2022 Bournemouth Air Festival. Speaking ahead of their performance, Ms Pobjoy told the BBC that quitting the profession following the incident was not an option. \"I was never going to let that stop me. You fall in love with something and you have to accept it for what it is. You take every show as it comes. \"I always have my trust in Dave, he's been my pilot for years and we do have a very special relationship... he is my hero.\" Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

            "text": "Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed on Sunday morning killing all 157 people on board.  It's led to a serious crisis for Boeing. The company manufactured the 737 Max 8 plane that was involved. The model has now been grounded globally as the pressure mounts in a search for answers. Current estimates of the number of 737 Max 8 and 9s grounded ranges from 350 to 370.  That represents a significant cost for airlines using the plane as routes, schedules and passengers are affected.  The race is on for investigators to find answers - and fast. The flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), or black boxes as they are often called, arrived in France on Thursday morning for inspection by the Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA), the French version of the UK's Air Accident Investigation Branch. Ethiopian inspectors chose to send the black boxes to France even though there are similar facilities in Nigeria, Dubai, Singapore, Germany and here in the UK at Farnborough.  But it is the country where the accident happens that makes the decision on where the black boxes go.  The BEA in France is a highly respected organisation with considerable expertise in this area.  In addition, part of the engines on the Boeing 737 Max 8 are manufactured by a French American conglomerate so this may have played a part. One of the biggest challenges in air accident investigation is locating the black boxes after a crash.  In modern aircraft, the black boxes are fitted at the back of the aircraft as history has shown that this area tends to sustain crash impact better. In the instance of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, the plane is reported to have hit the ground nose first at high speed. The rear of the aircraft was therefore closer to the surface which made it easier to find and retrieve the black boxes. Firstly, what state are they in? Black boxes are engineered to withstand huge force in order to protect the all-important data chips inside. But the casing could be crushed which means soldering it open.  Connectors inside could also be damaged which means starting the analysis could be delayed further. Once data chips are in hand, the information stored needs to be interpreted.  But the way that data is stored is not the same across the industry. Recording differs between specific aircraft models, operators and airlines.  For completely accurate data, conversion information held by Ethiopian Airlines will be necessary. It is hoped that conversion detail is readily available. Each black box holds 25 hours of flight information.  The last flight will be the prime focus but previous flights (over the 25 hour period of the recording) are also likely to be looked at to see if there were any anomalies.  The investigation in Ethiopia will be led by an investigator from that country, but will be assisted by teams from around the world, all with an interest in the crash.  The US will have sent investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, as the Boeing 737 Max-8 was manufactured there.  It is also thought French investigators are on site due to the black boxes making their way to France.  Three investigators from the UK arrived in Ethiopia on Tuesday to provide assistance, but plans are being made for them to return to the UK. How investigators work on the ground differs from country to country dependent on the lead investigator. But generally, separate teams will focus on different disciplines.  Core areas include:    The investigation in the field is only the start of a very long process.  Once everything has been documented and photographed, and witnesses have been contacted, the wreckage is usually recovered and transported to a secure facility for extensive analysis. Work on the black boxes will begin in Paris on Friday.  The first image of a black box reveals the damage it sustained after the crash and subsequent explosion.  When any data has been extracted, it will then be passed back to the lead investigator in Ethiopia, who will decide on the course of action and what information to release. A former investigator told me that the team in Paris will work day and night because of the global interest in this crash and the impact it is having on airlines, passengers and, most importantly, the bereaved families.  Interest in the what happened with Ethiopia Airlines flight 302  has been heightened because of reported similarities with a Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October 2018. Both flights were using the Boeing 737 Max 8.  But it could be tomorrow, the weekend or next week before we start to get the first answers. ",

            "text": "The captain of a Turkish AnadoluJet flight aborted its take-off at Israel's main airport after passengers received plane crash images on their phones. Israel's aviation authority said the aircraft was taxiing at Ben Gurion Airport when the incident happened. Passengers and crew were taken off and the luggage reinspected. Several young Israelis were identified as suspects and are being questioned. The plane departed five hours late after being cleared to leave. The AnadoluJet Boeing 737, with 160 passengers on board, was on its way to the take-off position when passengers alerted crew that they had received the photos. The captain was informed and decided to return to the terminal.  The Hebrew Ynet news site reported that the images were shared via AirDrop, an Apple service which enables users to send files from one Apple device to another across short distances. All the images were received on iPhones, it said.  The pictures included images of a Turkish Airlines plane which crashed in the Netherlands in 2009 and another plane crash in the United States in 2013, Ynet said. Passengers were told they could reboard the reinspected plane, which was headed to Istanbul, or stay in Israel. The incident comes two weeks after another security scare at Ben Gurion Airport. It happened when a family from the US produced a live artillery shell at check-in, which they had planned to take home as a souvenir. There was pandemonium as travellers fled the area, with one person requiring hospital treatment after falling over a conveyor belt in the rush to escape.",

            "text": "Boeing has successfully completed the first test flight of the world's largest twin-engined plane, the 777X. It comes as the firm attempts to boost its image after its 737 Max plane was grounded last year following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. The flight took off near Seattle and lasted four hours. Two attempts were called off this week due to high winds. Further tests are needed before the aircraft enters service with Emirates next year. The 252-foot-long passenger plane had been due to launch this year but has been delayed by some technical difficulties. The 777X is a larger and more efficient version of Boeing's successful 777 mini-jumbo. Standout features include folding wingtips and the world's largest commercial engines. \"It represents the great things we can do as a company,\" said 777X marketing director Wendy Sowers. Boeing says it has sold 309 of the plane - worth more than $442 million each at list prices.  The plane will go head-to-head with the Airbus A350-1000 which seats about 360 passengers. Boeing has been in crisis since the 737 Max crashes, which occurred within five months of each other - first in Indonesia in October 2018 and then in Ethiopia last March. It is facing multiple investigations amid accusations that it sacrificed safety as it rushed to get its jets to customers. It is attempting to have the plane re-approved for flight. The grounding of the 737 Max, which had been Boeing's best-selling plane, is estimated to have already cost Boeing more than $9bn.",

            "text": "The US Air Force has successfully launched its Atlas V rocket, carrying a X-37B space plane for a secretive mission. The rocket launched on Sunday from Cape Canaveral, a day after bad weather halted plans for a Saturday launch.  The aircraft, also known as an Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV), will deploy a satellite into orbit and also test power-beaming technology. It is the plane's sixth mission in space.  The launch was dedicated to front line workers and those affected by the pandemic. A message including the words \"America Strong\" was written on the rocket's payload fairing.  X-37B is a classified programme and United Launch Alliance, which operates the Atlas rocket, was required to end its webcast earlier in the flight than it would normally do. The Pentagon has revealed very few details about the reusable vehicle's missions and capabilities in the past, but Secretary of the Air Force, Barbara Barrett, said earlier this month: \"This X-37B mission will host more experiments than any other prior mission.\" It's known that one of the onboard experiments will test the effect of radiation on seeds and other materials.  The X-37B programme started in 1999. The vehicle (the project has two) resembles a smaller version of the crewed space shuttles that were retired by the US space programme in 2011. It can glide back down through the atmosphere to land on a runway, just as the shuttle did.  Built by Boeing, the plane uses solar panels for power in orbit, measures over 29ft (9m) long, has a wingspan of nearly 15ft and a weight of 11,000lbs (5,000kg). The first plane flew in April 2010 and returned after an eight-month mission.  The most recent mission ended in October 2019, after 780 days in orbit, bringing the X-37B programme's time in space to more than seven years. The length of this latest mission is currently unclear.

            "text": "India's national airline has told its crew to end every in-flight announcement with the patriotic phrase, \"Jai Hind\" (Hail the motherland) - and this has tickled social media users.  Air India's company advisory instructs crew to say the phrase after a \"slight pause and with much fervour\".   This quickly inspired tweets of imaginary in-flight announcements that end with \"Jai Hind\". But many wondered if patriotism was the right focus for the struggling airline. Air India, which is in severe debt, has not turned a profit since 2007 and a recent government offer to sell a controlling stake in it failed to attract any takers.  The directive from Air India comes at a time when patriotism is particularly high in India.  The country has been at loggerheads with its nuclear-armed neighbour Pakistan over the past few weeks, following a deadly suicide bombing that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary troops in the disputed Kashmir region.  The incident which led to airstrikes by India and the subsequent capture and release of an Indian pilot by Pakistan, saw increasing nationalist sentiment fuelled by national and social media. While some people welcomed the Air India directive on Monday, others joked about how unusual it might sound to end in-flight announcements - mundane or otherwise - with an energetic \"Jai Hind\".  One Twitter user even suggested a competition to see which passengers respond with the loudest \"Jai Hind\" - with the winner getting a free upgrade.  Air India, the country's oldest commercial airline, has long been the butt of jokes focusing on its customer service and old planes. It was recently in the news for a bed bug infestation on one of its aircraft. So Twitter users did not miss the opportunity to also poke fun at the airline for delays and cancellations. ",

            "text": "Indonesia has ordered inspections on all the country's commercial Boeing 737-Max 8 planes, after one crashed into the sea with 189 people on board. The Lion Air jet went down shortly after take-off near the capital, Jakarta, on Monday. There are no known survivors. Searchers have recovered debris, bodies and personal items. They are looking for the fuselage and flight recorders. Boeing launched its 737-Max 8 model last year.  The plane that crashed went into service just a few months ago. On Tuesday Indonesia's transport ministry said all Max 8 aircraft belonging to Indonesian commercial airlines would be inspected, but it stopped short of grounding them. Meanwhile Lion Air, the country's largest low-cost airline, said it would meet a Boeing team on Wednesday.  \"We have many questions for them. This was a new plane,\" Lion Air director Daniel Putut told reporters. Boeing has said it stands \"ready to provide technical assistance to the accident investigation\".  Indonesia, a vast archipelago, is heavily reliant on air travel but many of its airlines have a poor safety record. Lion Air was banned from flying into European airspace until 2016. We do not know yet. Flight JT610 was heading for the western city of Pangkal Pinang when it went down 13 minutes after taking off from Jakarta. Officials say the pilot had asked to return to Soekarno-Hatta airport before losing contact with air traffic control.  A log obtained by the BBC showed the plane had experienced technical problems while flying from Bali to Jakarta the previous day. The log showed one instrument was giving \"unreliable\" airspeed readings and the captain had to hand over to the first officer. Altitude readings also differed on the captain and first officer's instruments.  Lion Air chief executive Edward Sirait said on Tuesday that the plane had been repaired before being allowed to fly again. By Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Jakarta Another day of waiting for the families and loved ones of those on board.  Now they sit outside Jakarta's police hospital, where bodies are being brought. Lion Air is providing free flights from Bangka for the families of those onboard, like Surya's.  \"They have all come hoping for some closure and certainty,\" she says.  Her younger sister was on the plane. \"We want a body to grieve. She was the youngest in our family, so we all loved her very much. It feels very painful to lose the baby of the family.\" Outside the hospital I meet Murtado Kurinawan, whose newly-wed wife was on the plane, travelling for work.  He has brought her toothbrush in the hope it will help with the identification process.  \"I can't stop thinking about her. Her face fills my mind all the time,\" he said.  The plane plunged in waters that are about 30m (100ft) deep just north-east of Jakarta. Investigators say they are hopeful of finding the main fuselage. Teams are using an underwater drone, as well as underwater \"pinger locators\" to try to pick up the sonar signals from the cockpit recorders. Several bags of body parts recovered from the sea are being taken to Jakarta for identification.  Search official Yusuf Latif said it would be \"a miracle\" if survivors were found.",

            "text": "A pilot whose heroics became a Hollywood film says he knows the desperation that engulfed the cockpits on Boeing's two doomed 737 Max planes. Captain Chesley Sullenberger said flight control flaws would have left the pilots in a \"fight for their lives\" and unable to quickly grasp why the aircraft were not responding. He was speaking at a US Congressional hearing into the two fatal crashes. The movie \"Sully\" is about his landing of a passenger jet on a New York river. He told the committee: \"I'm one of a relatively small group of people who have experienced such a crisis and lived to share what we learned about it. \"I can tell you first hand that the startle-factor is real, and it's huge. And it absolutely and it quickly interferes with one's ability to quickly analyse the crisis and take effective action. \"Within seconds, these crews would have been fighting for their lives in the fight of their lives.\" Preliminary reports into both accidents have suggested the disasters were triggered by a flight control override system deploying at the wrong time, due to a faulty sensor. Last month, Congressman Sam Graves argued that \"facts in the preliminary report reveal pilot error as a factor\". But on Wednesday, Mr Sullenberger strongly rejected the suggestion. While everyone has a duty to keep passengers and crew safe, he said, \"first, we should design aircraft for them to crew that do not have inadvertent traps set for them\". The failure of single sensor reading \"quickly caused multiple instrument indication anomalies and sudden loud, and in some cases false warnings, creating major distractions... making it harder to quickly analyse the situation and take effective corrective action.\" He recently went through the cockpit scenario in a Max simulator and said that even knowing what was going to happen, \"I could see how crews would have run out of time before they could have solved the problem\". The US Federal Aviation Authority has been criticised for its lack of oversight and the certification process that cleared the Max to fly. All Boeing 737 Max planes were grounded in March after an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed, killing 157 people. Five months earlier, 189 people were killed when a Boeing 737 Max operated by Lion Air crashed. Mr Sullenberger said there was a multiple chain of events that caused the two crashes. But he added that the chain \"began many years ago with the decision to upgrade a half-century old design\". \"These crashes are demonstrable evidence that our current system of design and certification has failed us,\" he told the committee. Boeing is working with regulators to get the Max back in the air as soon as possible. But Mr Sullenberger said he did not expect accident investigators to complete their work for many months, putting a question mark over whether the aircraft can resume flights before the end of the year. He called for better pilot training before 737 Max is cleared to fly, saying that just reviewing Boeing's modifications to the aircraft on a computer was insufficient. \"Pilots must develop the muscle memory to be able to quickly and effectively respond to a sudden emergency,\" Mr Sullenberger told the House of Representatives subcommittee hearing. \"Reading about it on an iPad is not even close to sufficient; pilots must experience it physically, firsthand,\" he said. The hearing was the third by Congress into the crashes, and again focused on the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). In both Max crashes, the MCAS pointed the plane sharply downward based on a faulty sensor reading, hindering the pilots' effort to control the aircraft after takeoff.",

In a speech to mark his first 100 days, he also said he would ban public officials from flying first class. Pedro Castillo was elected narrowly in June, but the results were delayed when the opposition contested them. Selling the elderly Boeing might not be easy - ex-president Alan Garc\u00eda tried to auction it twice and failed. One of the reasons given was the asking price of $18.5m (\u00a313.8m).  Mr Garc\u00eda had acted after an incident known as the \"party plane\" scandal, which involved a group of allegedly drunk officials travelling on the jet in Spain. If the plane - which was acquired by another former president, Alberto Fujimori, in the mid-90s - does sell this time, the profit will go towards children's health and education. Peru's healthcare system has struggled to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.  For a period earlier this year, the country recorded the world's highest death rate from the virus, as a proportion of its population. In his speech, the president also announced a 7.5% rise in the minimum wage on 1 December from 930 to 1,000 sols ($230-$247; \u00a3172-184). Mr Castillo will hope his attempt to sell the presidential plane fares better than that of his Mexican counterpart, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador made it a priority to sell the plane when he came to power in 2018, including by lottery. But three years on, there are still no buyers. Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador has admitted that it is hard to sell because it was made bespoke, at a cost of $200m (\u00a3149.4m). The Mexican plane carries only 80 people, and has a full presidential suite with a private bath. Converting it to a commercial jet would be expensive.",

            "title": "Lion Air crash: Investigators say plane was 'not airworthy'",
            "text": "Indonesian investigators have said the Lion Air plane that crashed last month killing 189 people was not airworthy and should have been grounded. The Boeing 737 Max plane crashed into the Java Sea shortly after departing from Jakarta on 29 October. A preliminary report has found technical problems had been reported on previous flights. The 737 Max is a new version of Boeing's original 737 and has become its fastest selling plane.  The preliminary report details what is known by authorities about the short time the plane was in the air, but investigators said it did not give a definitive cause for the accident. The findings by the National Transport Safety Committee (KNKT) suggest that Lion Air put the plane back into service despite it having had problems on earlier flights. The pilots appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling - a new feature in the 737 Max family. Anti-stall systems prevent a plane from pointing upwards at too high an angle, where it could lose its lift. However, during the 29 October flight, the plane's automatic anti-stalling system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, even when the plane was not stalling - possibly due to a faulty sensor, the report said.  Pilots tried to correct this by pointing the nose higher, until the system pushed it down again. This happened more than 20 times. It is unclear why the pilots did not employ procedures to disable the automated system. Nurcahyo Utomo, aviation head at the National Transport Safety Committee, said it was \"too early to conclude\" whether the anti-stall system had contributed to the crash.  He added that the plane experienced similar problems during its previous flight from Denpasar in Bali to Jakarta. \"In our opinion, the plane was no longer airworthy and it should not have continued,\" he said. The committee's report itself, though, does not spell out that conclusion.   The report said that Lion Air's safety culture should be improved and the airline should ensure the operations manual is followed \"in order to improve the safety culture\". It also says the carrier must ensure \"all operations documents are properly filled and documented\". In a statement, plane manufacturer Boeing said that it was \"deeply saddened\" by the loss of the Lion Air flight. \"As our customers and their passengers continue to fly the 737 Max to hundreds of destinations around the world every day, they have our assurance that the 737 Max is as safe as any airplane that has ever flown in the skies.\" Boeing said that \"the appropriate procedure to address unintended horizontal stabiliser movement\" was contained in the relevant flight manuals. It said that the preliminary report showed that the correct procedures to counter the plane's nose being pushed down were carried out during the Denpasar flight the day before the crash. However, it was not clear if they procedures were followed during the 29 October flight that crashed, Boeing added. In an interview with the BBC, KNKT aviation head Nurcahyo Utomo appeared to dispute Boeing's account about the flight manuals. \"We haven't found the information in the manual relevant to the new feature to the 737- MAX, related to the feature for the stall prevention system,\" he said. Some pilots have also complained that they were not given all the relevant information about the differences between the latest anti-stall system, and older models, US media report.  The plane was making a one-hour journey to the western city of Pangkal Pinang when it went down. The jet crashed following a request from the pilot for permission to turn back to the airport minutes after taking off from Jakarta. Investigators had previously revealed that the plane, on previous flights, had experienced technical problems related to airspeed and altitude readings. Therefore the \"angle-of-attack\" sensor, which contributes to those readings, had been changed the day before the crash.  The plane's flight data recorder has been retrieved but authorities are yet to locate the cockpit voice recorder which could provide more information about how the pilots reacted. Victims' families are suing Boeing over alleged faults with the jet's design, focusing on the automated safety feature. Rebecca Henschke, BBC Indonesia editor, Jakarta Rini Soegiyono's sister and brother-in-law were on the flight. After hearing the preliminary findings, she said she had mixed emotions.  \"Sad, grieving, mourning, angry and disappointed - these are all the words that describe how I am feeling. But I am trying to be objective and strong.\" She, like many grieving families, is mostly frustrated that the search for the remaining passengers has officially ended.  \"There are still 64 families who haven't had their loved ones' remains identified and we have had to really push to get Lion Air and the authorities to search again for them. It's not good enough.\"  They want the airline to fund a search to find the remaining passengers as well as the cockpit voice recorder that hasn't been retrieved. It will be key, she says, to understanding what went wrong.  \"We are watching and waiting to understand who is responsible. I know the world is also watching. It's important to know so it will not happen again. We don't want any family to have to go through what we are going through.\" Budget airline Lion Air has in recent years risen to become a major player in South East Asia's low cost aviation sector.  The airline, which also operates Batik Air and Wings Air, has a dubious safety record, though, and has had more accidents than other airlines in the country.  Overall, Indonesia's aviation safety record has improved a lot since the days when even its national carrier Garuda was blacklisted from European and US airports over safety concerns. ",

            "text": "Aerospace giant Boeing is reportedly hiring 160 pilots to be embedded at airlines in a bid to help the 737 Max return to smooth service.  The new \u201cGlobal Engagement Pilots\u201d will act as instructors or cockpit observers on 35-day assignments.  The planes were grounded worldwide in March 2019 following two deadly crashes that killed 346 people. Brazil's Gol recently became the first airline to resume commercial flights with the model. \u201cWe continue to work closely with global regulators and customers to safely return the 737-8 and 737-9 to service worldwide,\u201d Boeing told the BBC in a statement.  The move is part of a broader programme to support customers on all Boeing commercial models.   The pilots will be paid an equivalent annual salary that could reach $200,000, for a total potential cost of $32m, according to Reuters news agency. Pilots in the programme must have 1,000 hours of instructor experience and \u201cno incidents, accidents, losses or violations,\u201d and be licensed on the 737 and other Boeing jetliners.  The strategy also includes 24/7 surveillance of 737 Max flights globally and talking points for flight attendants to reassure passengers.  Lion Air Flight 610 crashed after take-off from Jakarta in October 2018, while Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed after take-off from Addis Ababa airport in March 2019.  Before the 737 Max was cleared to fly again, Boeing updated flight control software, revised crew procedures and rerouted internal wiring. When it was cleared to fly again, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration Steve Dickson said he was \"100% confident\" in the safety of the plane. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency is yet to clear the plane for a return to service, but is expected to do so in January.  A smooth return to service is seen as vital for Boeing, which announced its fourth straight quarterly loss in October, along with deeper job cuts.  The 737 MAX issue saw annual orders drop to their lowest level in two decades.  Boeing\u2019s problems have also been compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has affected the entire aviation sector.",

            "title": "Canada joins ban on Boeing crash aircraft",
            "text": "Canada has grounded the world's third largest fleet of Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, following the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet on Sunday. The country's regulator said that three Canadian airlines, operating 41 Max 8 jets, would be unable to use them in Canada's airspace. Canada joins a long list of countries to halt the aircraft's use. But the US regulator says it is safe to fly. Canada's transport minister said it had received new evidence about the crash. Marc Garneau said that satellite data showed possible similarities between flight patterns of Boeing 737 Max planes operating in Canada and the Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed. He said: \"As a result of new data that we received this morning, and had the chance to analyze, and on the advice of my experts and as a precautionary measure, I issued a safety notice. \"This safety notice restricts commercial passenger flights from any operator of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 or MAX 9 variant aircraft, whether domestic or foreign, from arriving, departing or overflying Canadian air space. \"This safety notice is effective immediately and will remain in place until further notice.\" The Polish Civil Aviation Authorities also announced on Wednesday that it had closed its aerospace to the Boeing 737 Max 8. The UK, the European Union, China, Australia and India are among the countries that have suspended the Boeing 737 Max from their airspace.  However, the US Federal Aviation Administration said a review had showed \"no systemic performance issues\" and that there was no basis for grounding the aircraft.  On Wednesday, the chief executive of Ethiopian Airlines, Tewolde Gebremariam, told the BBC that all 737 Max aircraft worldwide should be grounded until the causes of the crash were known. Meanwhile, it has emerged that pilots in the US had complained about problems controlling the Boeing 737 Max 8 during take-off, echoing difficulties that contributed to the fatal Lion Air crash in Indonesia last October. Documents reveal that pilots reported engaging autopilot only for the aircraft's nose to pitch lower, prompting the warning system to exclaim: \"Don't sink! Don't sink!\" The Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed just six minutes into its flight. Two US pilots reported separate incidents involving the 737 Max's automatic anti-stalling system in November. The feature - new to the the 737 Max family, which began flying commercially in 2017 - is designed to keep the plane from stalling. The system prevents the aircraft from pointing upwards at too high an angle, where it could lose its lift. However, according to filings with the US Aviation Safety Reporting System, which pilots use to disclose information anonymously, it appeared to force the nose down.  In both cases, pilots were forced to intervene to stop the plane from descending. One first officer said that they had discussed what had happened at length with the captain  \"I reviewed in my mind our automation setup and flight profile but can't think of any reason the aircraft would pitch nose down so aggressively,\" they said. Investigators have recovered the flight data recorders from the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash but have yet to determine what caused the accident. Flightradar24 reported that that the plane vertical speed was unstable after take off. After the Lion Air crash, Boeing issued guidance on what to do regarding erroneous readings from the sensor, which sends out information about what angle a plane is flying at. But another pilot said that \"it did nothing\" to address the problems with the sensor.  They said: \"I think it is unconscionable that a manufacturer, the FAA, and the airlines would have pilots flying an airplane without adequately training, or even providing available resources and sufficient documentation to understand the highly complex systems that differentiate this aircraft from prior models.  They added: \"I am left to wonder: what else don't I know? The flight manual is inadequate and almost criminally insufficient.\" ",

In the week, overnight flights faced problems, while two passenger flights were diverted to Leeds and Manchester on Friday afternoon. The airport, Leicestershire Police and the organisers of the nearby Download Festival said they were closely monitoring the situation. The three-day rock and heavy metal festival is taking place until Sunday at Donington Park in Leicestershire, about one mile (1.6km) from the airport. The airport's runway was closed for an hour from 23:15 BST and six passenger and two cargo flights were forced to reroute. Clare James, the airport's managing director, said: \"It beggars belief that someone would do this. \"It's a criminal offence, it is very inconvenient for passengers, it costs thousands of pounds for cargo carriers but most of all it is a flight safety risk. \"We have detection equipment here, we are working with police, so my message to whoever is doing this is just stop or face prosecution.\" In a joint statement on Friday, the police, airport and festival team said: \"Both the festival organisers and the police have enhanced the number of patrols on site and the surrounding areas. \"The public are reminded that flying a drone in proximity to an operational airport is an offence under the Civil Aviation Act 1982 and is a huge risk to public safety. The police will take appropriate action if necessary.\" As well as a busy passenger airport, East Midlands hosts the UK's largest dedicated air cargo operation, which handles more than 440,000 tonnes of goods a year.

            "text": "Boeing has reached an agreement with the families of the 157 people who died in the Ethiopia 737 Max crash in 2019. The plane maker accepts liability for their deaths, according to court documents in Chicago. In return, families of the victims will not seek punitive damages from the company. Lawyers for the victims' families said Boeing would still be held \"fully accountable\", welcoming the agreement as a significant milestone. Boeing shares fell 1% to $218.50 on the news.  The agreement opens the way for families outside the US, in countries such as Ethiopia and Kenya, to claim compensation through the US courts, rather than in their home countries, which might be more difficult and result in lower payments. Mark Pegram in the UK, whose son Sam was one of the victims, said: \"The main positive for us is that Boeing is admitting liability, and not diverting blame onto Ethiopian Airlines or the pilots... we wanted them to hold their hands up.\" Sam's mother Debbie told the BBC: \"All we are looking to do with any compensation is set up a charity in Sam's name. It's what we want to do and it's what Sam would have wanted us to do.\" At the time of the crash, the 737 Max was Boeing's best-selling plane.  But two fatal accidents within five months - the Ethiopia Airlines flight out of Addis Ababa and before that a Lion Air jet that came down into the sea off Indonesia - signalled there were serious faults with the aircraft. The planes were grounded for 20 months, while investigations took place, but have since been allowed to return to operations after the firm made significant changes to their software and training. Words are important and in this agreement Boeing accepts responsibility for the crash of ET302 - a disaster which claimed the lives of 157 people from 35 different countries.  The world may have moved on and the 737 Max may be flying again, but for many of the families of those who died, the grief and sense of loss remains very raw indeed.  In the period since the two accidents involving the 737 Max, Boeing has faced criticism for appearing to deflect blame elsewhere, for example by questioning the abilities of the pilots.  So that admission of liability really does matter.   For Boeing, the agreement provides some protection, by removing the possibility of relatives seeking potentially very high punitive damages and by making it unlikely current or former executives will be called to testify in court. Alongside the settlement reached in a lawsuit bought by shareholders last week - who had been suing the company over unsafe business practices - it removes much of the legal jeopardy the aerospace giant had been facing.  But the company has made a significant concession. It has agreed that all compensation claims can be made under US law, which provides for much higher levels of compensation than would apply in many other countries.  The agreement reached in Chicago, Illinois, where Boeing is headquartered, opens the way for compensation claims to be made.  While it does not stipulate any specific level of compensation for the victims' families, the agreement will limit the scale and scope of any further procedures. Legal experts say it makes the prospect of current or former Boeing executives testifying in court much less likely. \"Boeing is committed to ensuring that all families who lost loved ones in the accidents are fully and fairly compensated for their loss,\" the plane maker said in a statement. \"By accepting responsibility, Boeing's agreement with the families allows the parties to focus their efforts on determining the appropriate compensation for each family.\" Lawyers for the victims released a statement saying that under the agreement, Boeing admitted \"that the 737 Max had an unsafe condition, and that it will not attempt to blame anyone else\" for the crash. \"This is a significant milestone for the families in their pursuit of justice against Boeing, as it will ensure they are all treated equitably and eligible to recover full damages under Illinois law, while creating a pathway for them to proceed to a final resolution, whether through settlements or trial,\" the lawyers said. In January, Boeing agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice, including $2.5bn (\u00a31.9bn) in fines and compensation stemming from the 737 Max crashes, including the Lion Air crash in October 2018.",

            "text": "Boeing's apology for the Ethiopian Airlines crash last month is \"too little, too late\", the pilot's father has told the BBC.  Dr Getachew Tessema was speaking a day after the US manufacturer admitted for the first time that the plane's anti-stall system was a factor in the crash.  Boeing's chief executive officer also said the company was \"sorry for the lives lost\".   The Boeing 737 Max crashed just after take-off killing all 157 on board. A preliminary report from the Ethiopian authorities issued on Thursday said the pilots of flight ET302 \"repeatedly\" followed procedures recommended by Boeing before the crash south of the capital, Addis Ababa.  The pilots were responding to the plane nose-diving as the anti-stall system malfunctioned. Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges said that despite their efforts, the pilots \"were not able to control the aircraft\". The accident came only five months after another 737 Max crashed. Lion Air flight JT 610 plunged into the sea off Indonesia killing all 189 people on board - again after the pilots encountered problems with the anti-stall system.  Dr Tessema is grieving for Yared Getachew, the 29-year-old pilot who had more than 8,000 hours of flying experience when he was killed.  Yared had been planning to marry another pilot this year.   His father collapsed and was hospitalised when told of the accident as he struggled to grapple with what had happened.  \"I am very proud about my son and the other pilot, both of them,\" he told the BBC's Emmanuel Igunza.  \"To the last minute they struggled as much as they could but unfortunately they were not able to stop it.  \"I don't regret that he was a pilot. He died in the course of his duty.\" Dr Tessema levels the blame for the accident squarely at Boeing, questioning why the company did not stop the 737 Max flying after the Indonesia crash.  \"Why did they let them fly? Because they were in competition. They want to sell more. Human life has no meaning in some societies.\" Dr Tessema says he has not ruled out taking legal action, but will wait and speak to relatives and friends before making a decision.   CEO Dennis Muilenburg issued a video statement on Thursday.  On the human cost, he said: \"We at Boeing are sorry for the lives lost in the recent 737 accidents and are relentlessly focused on safety to ensure tragedies like this never happen again.\" It was, he said, \"apparent\" that in both the Ethiopia and Indonesia flights, the software for the anti-stall system - or MCAS - was \"activated in response to erroneous angle of attack information\". He added: \"As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high workload environment. It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it and we know how to do it.\" Boeing is planning to release a software update for the MCAS, along with more pilot training for the 737 Max. At the same time, pilots will always be able to override MCAS and control the aircraft manually, Boeing says.  ",

            "text": "European aircraft maker Airbus has cut production of its A380 superjumbo for the second time in a year. Deliveries of the double-decker will now fall from 15 this year to 12 in 2018 and eight in 2019, Airbus said. Chief Executive Tom Enders said that prospects of further sales of the A380 in the short-term were not \"necessarily high\".  Airbus, which has not had an A380 order for two years, makes the wings at its factory at Broughton, north Wales. The company said on Thursdays that production of the A380 continued to operate at a marginal loss. In June, Airbus unveiled an upgraded version of the world's largest passenger jet, promising greater fuel efficiency and room for more seats. Airbus hopes it will be the catalyst for more orders from airlines. Also on Thursday, Airbus posted second-quarter operating profits which fell 27% to 859m euros (\u00a3765m) on revenues of 15.27bn euros. That fell short of the 910m euro profit expected by analysts polled by Reuters. On Wednesday, shares in rival Boeing hit a record high after its second-quarter profit and cashflow came in well ahead of Wall Street estimates. Production at Airbus has been hit by delays in delivery of US engine-maker Pratt & Whitney's engines for the A320neo aircraft. The fuel-saving Geared Turbofan engine has suffered reliability problems. On Thursday, Airbus chief executive Tom Enders said Pratt & Whitney had to \"work harder\" to fix the problems. \"It should be a winning engine but they need to fix it,\" he told reporters. \"Pratt & Whitney has introduced some fixes but we are still waiting for these improvements to come through.\" He also said that Airbus was in \"constructive talks\" with Qatar Airways over a recent cancellation of four A350 aircraft, adding, \"I think we will find a way out\" of the issue.",

            "text": "The European Union and India have banned the Boeing 737 Max from flying over their airspace to ensure passenger safety.  They join a long list of countries in suspending the plane, including the UK.  It comes after an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed on Sunday, killing 157 people on board. It was the second fatal accident involving the 737 Max 8 model in less than five months. US officials say the aircraft are still safe to fly. However, the US Association of Flight Attendants-CWA union is now calling for the Federal Aviation Administration \"to temporarily ground the 737 Max fleet in the US out of an abundance of caution\". India's Ministry of Civil Aviation announced that it would ground the Boeing 737-Max planes \"immediately\". It said: \"These planes will be grounded till appropriate modifications and safety measures are undertaken to ensure their safe operations.\" It following a similar decision by the EU Aviation Safety Agency which said it is suspending the aircraft \"as a precautionary measure\". Earlier today, the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it was banning the plane, joining other countries including China. Investigators have recovered the flight recorders from the Ethiopian Airlines plane and are currently examining the data to determine what caused the crash. EU Aviation Safety Agency said: \"The accident investigation is currently ongoing, and it is too early to draw any conclusions as to the cause of the accident.\"  The CAA said its directive would remain in place until further notice. It said it took the decision because it did not currently have \"sufficient information\" from the flight data recorder about the fatal crash. Tui Airways and Norwegian both operate the Boeing Max 8 in the UK as part of their fleets. One Turkish Airlines flight to Birmingham turned around and returned to Istanbul. And a Norwegian Air plane from Stockholm to Tel Aviv turned back over Romania. A Tui statement confirmed their 737 Max 8 aircraft were grounded. \"Any customers due to fly home today on a 737 Max 8 from their holiday will be flown back on another aircraft,\" it read. \"Customers due to travel in the coming days will also travel on holiday as planned on other aircraft.\"  Norwegian said it had also suspended flights of the aircraft and apologised for the inconvenience to passengers. India's SpiceJet, which has an estimated 13 Boeing 737 Max 8 planes in its fleet, has suspended the aircraft.  The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has declared the 737 Max 8 airworthy. But the largest operator of 737 Max 8s in America, Southwest Airlines, is offering passengers scheduled to fly on one of the Boeing planes the chance to change their bookings. Rival American Airlines said its \"standard policies for changes still apply\". Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running to be the Democrats' presidential candidate, called on the FAA \"to get these planes out of the sky.\" Boeing has confirmed that for the past few months it has been developing a \"flight control software enhancement\" for the aircraft, but says it is confident they are safe to fly. More than $27bn (\u00a321bn) has been wiped off the company's market value since the close of trading on Friday. In the aftermath of the accident, Ethiopia, Singapore, China, France, Ireland, Germany, Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia have all temporarily suspended the 737 Max. Singapore's Changi Airport is the world's sixth busiest and a major hub connecting Asia to Europe and the US, but only a handful of airlines operate the Max 8 aircraft in and out of the country. No Australian airlines operate the Boeing 737 Max, and only two foreign airlines - SilkAir and Fiji Airways - fly the model into the country.  The Boeing 737 Max fleet of aircraft are the latest in the company's successful 737 line. The group includes the Max 7, 8, 9 and 10 models. By the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 of the Max 8 model out of 5,011 orders. A small number of Max 9s are also operating.  The Max 7 and 10 models, not yet delivered, are due for roll-out in the next few years. The Max 8 that crashed on Sunday was one of 30 ordered as part of Ethiopian Airlines' expansion. It underwent a \"rigorous first check maintenance\" on 4 February, the airline said. Following last October's Lion Air crash in Indonesia, investigators said the pilots had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling, a new feature of the jet. It is not yet clear whether the anti-stall system was the cause of Sunday's crash. Aviation experts say other technical issues or human error cannot be discounted. Eyewitnesses say they saw a trail of smoke, sparks and debris as the plane nosedived. Have you been personally affected by this story? Please get in touch with us by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

            "title": "Gatwick: Norwegian axes 1,000 jobs at airport in long haul cuts",
            "text": "Budget airline Norwegian has axed its long-haul network, leading to the loss of 1,100 pilot and cabin crew jobs based at Gatwick Airport. The carrier's board of directors said it will continue to operate with a \"simplified business structure\". It comes following the \"profound\" impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the aviation industry, the board said. A Gatwick spokeswoman said the demand for slots at the airport remained strong.   The airline will now focus on its European short-haul network, using smaller aircraft. Norwegian shook up the UK's long-haul aviation market in recent years by offering transatlantic flights at knockdown prices. Some of its most popular deals included \u00a399 trips to New York. But its entire Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet has been grounded since March 2020. In August 2020, the airline announced it needed financial support to get through the pandemic, after a loss of \u00a3442m for the first six months of the year. Chief executive Jacob Schram said: \"By focusing our operation on a short-haul network, we aim to attract existing and new investors, serve our customers and support the wider infrastructure and travel industry. \"Our focus is to rebuild a strong, profitable Norwegian so that we can safeguard as many jobs as possible.\" A Gatwick spokeswoman said the airport would remain \"an important part\" of Norwegian's future plans. \"The demand for slots at Gatwick - both long and short-haul - remains very strong,\" the spokeswoman added.  \"We will continue to pursue new opportunities with Norwegian and other airlines to offer passengers a variety of choice for their 2021 future travel plans.\" Norwegian wasn't the first airline to try to prove that low cost and long haul could go together on international flights - but for a while it seemed to be the most credible.  The company was determined to prove that a new generation of fuel-efficient aircraft could make cheap transatlantic services viable, in a way that had not previously been the case.  Using a fleet of Boeing 787s to fly routes such as London Gatwick to New York JFK, it did at one point seem to have established long distance carriers thoroughly rattled - even attracting a couple of takeover bids from British Airways' owner IAG. However, all was not well. Rapid expansion had left the airline weighed down with debt and struggling to make money, even before the Covid pandemic plunged the entire industry into a deep crisis. Norwegian has been a hair's breadth from collapse for months, and is still desperate for new investment. And so a business model which looked questionable even during the good times has been cast aside in a simple bid for survival.  About 2,160 jobs will be lost around the world - including at Gatwick - as the firm also has long-haul bases in France, Italy, Spain and the US. Customers with affected bookings will be contacted by the airline and refunded. The firm has resumed talks with the Norwegian government about further state support.",

            "text": "More than 200 flights were cancelled at Frankfurt airport after construction work damaged broadband cables and caused check-in and boarding problems for German airline Lufthansa.  But the airline said all of its systems were now back up.  Earlier on Wednesday, thousands of passengers were stranded as their flights were cancelled or delayed across the world.  The airline expect flights at Frankfurt to return to normal on Thursday.  The company said engineering works on a railway line mistakenly cut a bundle of cables in Frankfurt on Tuesday.    It has asked customers flying on domestic flights to book train tickets and said customers could ask for a refund on its website.  \"We are working on a solution swiftly,\" Lufthansa tweeted. More than a hundred flights have also been delayed, according to data from flight tracking website FlightAware. Some travellers on social media claimed the German airline switched to using pen and paper to organise boarding and was not able to digitally process baggage.  One customer tweeted that Frankfurt airport staff were only assisting individuals that were manually checked in. Others said they were confused about how to get their refunds and had not received any support from the company.  \"Lufthansa asks affected passengers to check the status of their flight on the company's app or website before arriving at the airport. Passengers with domestic flights can switch to Deutsche Bahn until Sunday,\" the airline said in a statement.  \"We regret the inconvenience this will cause our passengers,\" a spokesperson from the company added.  Air traffic controllers have diverted flights from Germany's busiest airport Frankfurt, but the problem has affected services worldwide. Lufthansa and Germany's national train operator blamed the fault on a drill which cut through a Deutsche Telekom fibre optic cable bundle. This meant passenger check-in and boarding systems at Lufthansa seized up on Wednesday and prompted German air traffic control to suspend incoming flights.  However, these have since resumed, with some 40 landings per hour at Frankfurt airport since midday on Wednesday which Germany's DFS air traffic controllers said is nearly normal traffic.  Deutsche Telekom said in a statement: \"Two cables have already been repaired overnight by our technical team and many customers are already back online.\" Separately, German airport workers are due to go on strike on Friday in a dispute about pay.   Last month, domestic flights were grounded across the US after a contractor deleted files on a crucial computer server used by pilots. More than 11,000 flights were delayed and at least 1,300 were cancelled on 11 January after the Notice to Air Missions (Notam) system went offline.",

Ukraine has called for negotiations over the compensation and for those behind the attack to face justice. The Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737 was struck by two missiles shortly after taking off from Tehran. After initially denying responsibility, Iran admitted it had shot down the UIA flight \"unintentionally\". Tehran called it a \"disastrous mistake\" by the Revolutionary Guards Corps. The victims included 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians including nine crew members, four Afghans, four Britons and three Germans. Iran's air defences had been on high alert at the time. Hours earlier, the country had fired ballistic missiles at two US bases in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani by a US drone strike in Baghdad. In a statement, Iran's government said it would pay the compensation \"as soon as possible\". On Wednesday Tehran also said it had sent its final report on the crash to the countries which had been investigating it - Ukraine, the US, France, Canada, Sweden, the UK and Germany. But Ukraine's foreign ministry said compensation amounts should be arrived at through negotiations according to international practice, and demanded those behind the attack face prosecution. \"The Ukrainian side expects from Iran a draft technical report on the circumstances of the aircraft shooting down,\" ministry spokesman Oleh Nikolenko said. \"This situation is especially unacceptable, since we are talking about the fate of innocent people,\" he said, adding that Ukraine would continue to try to ensure that those responsible faced justice. Earlier this month an independent Canadian report questioned Iran's investigation into the incident. Many crucial details had not been disclosed, such as the names of those determined to be responsible for carrying out the attack, and questions such as why Iranian airspace had not been closed on the night of 8 January had not been answered, the report, written by the Canadian government's special counsel on the incident, said. \"The party responsible for the situation is investigating itself, largely in secret. That does not inspire confidence or trust,\" said the report. Hamed Esmaeilion, spokesman for the Association of Families of Flight PS752, said families wanted those responsible to face justice in an independent court and a fully accountable investigation into the incident. Iran also delayed releasing the plane's \"black box\" voice recorder for six months, but in July sent it to France for examination. On 8 January, at 06:12 local time (02:42 GMT), UIA flight PS752 took off from Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran. The plane was a Boeing 737-800 - one of the international airline industry's most widely used aircraft models. Before leaving the airport's air space, the plane appeared to turn around to return to the runway. Shortly afterwards, it crashed. The government in Tehran initially said the UIA plane had suffered a technical problem shortly after take-off. It cited witnesses including the crew of another passenger plane who said it had been on fire prior to impact. Authorities said they had lost radar contact when the plane was at an altitude of about 8,000ft (2,400m), minutes after taking off. A later report by the Civil Aviation Organisation of Iran said the air defence unit that targeted the passenger plane had recently moved and had failed to calibrate its equipment correctly. As a result, it misidentified the civilian plane as a hostile object. The report also said the missile battery had been unable to communicate with its command centre, and had fired on the plane without receiving official approval.",

            "title": "Iran plane downing: Person who filmed video 'arrested'",
            "text": "Iran says it has arrested the person who filmed the footage showing a Ukrainian passenger plane being shot down by a missile. It is believed the person being detained will face charges related to national security.  Flight PS752 was brought down after it took off from Tehran on Wednesday last week, killing all 176 people on board.  Iran has said it was shot down by accident and announced the arrest of several people over the incident.  President Hassan Rouhani said his country's investigation would be overseen by a \"special court\". \"This will not be a regular and usual case. The whole world will be watching this court,\" he said in a speech. Mr Rouhani also stressed that the \"tragic event\" should not be blamed on one individual. \"It's not only the person who pulled the trigger, but also others who are responsible,\" he said. Iran initially denied that the aircraft was hit by a missile, but later conceded that the passenger jet was hit by its air defence systems. When the video was shared on social media, it led analysts to say it showed the plane was hit by a missile. Iranian media reported that Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards had taken a person who posted a video last week of the missile striking the plane into custody. But an Iranian journalist based in London who initially posted the footage has insisted that his source is safe, and that the Iranian authorities have arrested the wrong person. Earlier on Tuesday, Iranian judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said that several people had been detained over the downing of the plane. He added that about 30 people had been arrested for \"taking part in illegal gatherings\" - an apparent reference to recent anti-government protests. Separately the New York Times said security camera footage showed two missiles were fired at the plane, more than 20 seconds apart.  The paper said this would explain why the plane's transponder seemed to have stopped working before the missile strike - it had been disabled by the first missile. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC on Tuesday that he was \"glad\" Iran had acknowledged making a \"terrible mistake\" in shooting down the plane. \"It's good that they've apologised. The most important thing now is that tensions in the region calm down,\" he added.  Mr Johnson said the next step for Iran was to \"repatriate in a dignified way\" the bodies of the passengers and crew of flight PS752, who included three Britons. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said on Monday that five of the countries that had citizens on board the airliner - Canada, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Sweden and an unnamed country - would meet in London on Thursday to discuss possible legal action. He said the \"grieving nations\" would work out what steps to take individually and collectively to \"bring the perpetrators to justice and how we can repay those families who have suffered\". Canada, which lost 57 citizens, will meanwhile play a more active role than international rules require in the investigation into the shooting down of the airliner, according to Kathy Fox, the head of its Transportation Safety Board (TSB).",

            "text": "Instagram blocked posts using a hashtag in memory of the victims of a Ukrainian airliner shot down by Iranian security forces two years ago. Families of the 176 victims found posts with the hashtag #IWillLightACandletoo, as well as its Persian version, were not visible to users. A cybersecurity expert said it appeared that Iran had orchestrated the block by reporting the posts. The social media giant said the hashtag was \"restricted by mistake\". Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 was hit by two missiles after taking off from Tehran on 8 January 2020. Iran has blamed human error for the disaster, saying an air defence unit had mistaken the Boeing 737-800 for a US missile. Nine crew members were killed, along with 167 passengers. Ukraine has rejected the findings of an Iranian investigation into the crash as a \"cynical attempt\" to conceal the truth. The Association of Families of the Victims began using the #IWillLightACandletoo hashtag as a show of solidarity just days before the second anniversary of the crash, but found it had been blocked. \"It was deeply disappointing, there was nothing offensive about the hashtags, but sadly big firms like Facebook [now called Meta and which owns Instagram] are easily deceived by the cyber armies of authoritarian regimes,\" said association spokesperson Hamed Esmaeilion, who lost both his wife and daughter in the incident. Instagram's auto response said the posts had \"been limited because the community has reported some content that may not meet Instagram's Community Guidelines\". It is unclear who reported the hashtag or why, but Middle East cybersecurity expert Amir Rashidi suspects it was orchestrated. \"It is likely that users close to Iran have reported the hashtag and machines that lack enough knowledge of local politics decided to ban them. This enables authoritarian regimes to exploit social media platforms\", said Mr Rashidi, director of digital rights and security at the Miaan Group.  The block was lifted after almost 24 hours and only after several Persian speaking activists and media organisations reached out to Instagram/Meta.  In a response to a BBC enquiry, a Meta spokesperson said: \"We became aware that these hashtags had been restricted by mistake, and worked quickly to fix it. You should now be able to use these hashtags as normal, and we're so sorry for any inconvenience or confusion caused.\"  But this is not the only incident in which a hashtag or a post has been limited by Instagram.  According to several Iranian users, Instagram has banned content showing police brutality in recent weeks, citing the violent nature of the videos.  \"If they don't want to be used as tools for suppression, social media platforms like Meta must collaborate with trusted internet freedom organisations and people with local knowledge about the political and cultural context of each country,\" said Mr Rashidi. \"These are not decisions that can be left to machines.\" ",

            "title": "BA Gatwick Airport double vodkas pilot jailed",
            "text": "A British Airways pilot who turned up for work after drinking three double vodkas has been jailed. Julian Monaghan boarded a plane to Mauritius at Gatwick Airport but was led away in handcuffs after colleagues smelled alcohol and called police. He had 86mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in his system in January - the legal limit for a pilot is 20mg. Monaghan, 49, admitted being over the prescribed limit and was jailed for eight months at Lewes Crown Court. During sentencing Judge Janet Waddicor told Monaghan, who resigned from his British Airways job, \"you took a risk and it didn't pay off because you were caught\". \"You are in charge of a huge aircraft. The safety, if not the lives, indeed, of passengers and crew members are in the hands of the pilot. They are entitled to feel that they are safe.\" On arrest, Monaghan, from South Africa, told police he drank a glass of wine on his overnight flight as a passenger from Cape Town to Heathrow. He said he consumed \"a measure\" of vodka with diet Pepsi in his hotel room on an empty stomach and barely slept before he was due on board the long-haul flight to Mauritius. The court heard Monaghan had since remembered drinking three miniature bottles of vodka. He insisted he obeyed the airline's eight-hour \"bottle to throttle rule\", which forbids pilots from drinking for that amount of time before going on duty. He had initially queried the results of tests but resigned two months after his arrest when further tests confirmed the samples were accurate. Amy Packham, prosecuting, said the reading taken at 22:30 GMT remained so high that he must have drunk a \"significant amount\" just before the eight-hour limit. Some 300 people were on the 12-hour flight, which had been scheduled to leave at 20:20. But the Boeing 777 was left waiting at the gate while airline staff looked for a third pilot. It eventually took off just before 23:00. Monaghan would not have had to take up the role of pilot until three-and-a-half hours into the flight, the court heard. Emlyn Jones, defending, said Monaghan - whose childhood dream was to be a pilot - had been \"extremely stupid\" and bitterly regretted his actions. \"Certainly he will never fly as a commercial pilot again. His career and livelihood and personal and professional reputation are all up in smoke.\" Det Con Stuart Macpherson, of Sussex Police, said: \"Had Monaghan been required to take control of the aircraft in the event of an emergency on the flight deck in the early stages of the flight, his judgement and abilities would have been impaired.\" A British Airways spokeswoman said: \"This behaviour is completely unacceptable and not what we expect from our highly professional fleet of pilots. \"The safety and security of our customers and colleagues is always our top priority.\"",

            "text": "Boeing's 737 Max jet has been banned from operating in Irish airspace by the country's aviation authority. The decision comes after an Ethopian Airlines plane crashed on Sunday, killing 157 people on board. It was the second fatal accident involving the 737 Max 8 model in the past five months. The Irish airspace ban means that several flights between Dublin and the United States, operated by the airline Norwegian, have been cancelled. The airline uses Boeing's 737 Max planes on its routes from Dublin Airport to New York Stewart International Airport and to Providence Airport in Rhode Island. The Irish Aviation Authority's (IAA) said it was suspending flights by Boeing's 737 Max \"from any operator arriving, departing or overflying\" the country's airspace from 15:00 local time on Tuesday. Norwegian's 14:55 departure from Dublin to Providence and its 15:20 flight to Newburgh on Tuesday were cancelled, along with Wednesday's 07:20 arrival from Newburgh. The airline it was reallocating other planes from its fleet to cover routes that its Boeing 737 Max aircraft were due to fly in order to \"minimise inconvenience caused for our passengers\". \"Affected passengers will be informed via SMS and our web pages,\" added the airline. The decision was made to guarantee the \"continued safety of passengers and flight crew, which is the IAA's number one priority\", it added. The IAA said that the ban was \"precautionary\" and it had taken account of the \"unprecedented loss of two Boeing 737 Max in recent months\". Other countries have also ordered the grounding of the jets, including the UK, France, Germany and China. The UK's Civil Aviation Authority put a ban in place \"as a precautionary measure\". However, US officials say the aircraft are still safe to fly. Norweigan said it would not operate any flights using the Boeing's 737 Max \"until further notice\". Tomas Hesthammer, the airline's chief operating officer, said: \"We would like to apologise to customers for any inconvenience caused. \"However, safety will always remain our top priority.\"",

            "text": "As temperatures climb in Phoenix, Arizona, more than 40 flights have been cancelled - because it is too hot for the planes to fly. The weather forecast for the US city suggests temperatures could reach 120F (49C) on Tuesday. That is higher than the operating temperature of some planes. American Airlines announced it was cancelling dozens of flights scheduled to take off from Sky Harbor airport during the hottest part of the day. The local Fox News affiliate in Phoenix said the cancellations mostly affected regional flights on the smaller Bombardier CRJ airliners, which have a maximum operating temperature of about 118F (48C). The all-time record for temperatures in Phoenix is just slightly higher, at 122F, which hit on 26 June 1990. The cancelled flights were scheduled to take off between 15:00 and 18:00 local time. At higher temperatures, air has a lower density - it is thinner. That lower air density reduces how much lift is generated on an aircraft's wings - a core principle in aeronautics. That, in turn, means the aircraft's engines need to generate more thrust to get airborne. It's a well-known problem - a 2016 report from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) even warned that higher temperatures caused by climate change could \"have severe consequences for aircraft take-off performance, where high altitudes or short runways limit the payload or even the fuel-carrying capacity\". Those problems are why many countries in the Middle East, and some high-altitude airports in South America, tend to schedule long flights for the evening or night, when it is cooler. Bigger aircraft like Boeing 747s and Airbus models have a slightly higher operating temperature, and have not been affected by the heat in Phoenix. An American Airlines statement provided to The Arizona Republic newspaper said those jets should be fine up to 126-127F (53C) - just a little higher than what is expected. Those temperatures, however, are forecast for the aptly named Furnace Creek in Death Valley, in California, with some areas expecting new temperature records on Tuesday. The Death Valley National Parks Service has issued a warning to visitors to avoid hiking after 10am, and to \"travel prepared to survive\".",

The jet had been chartered by the Home Office to take people from UK detention centres to Africa on 28 March 2017. A jury heard the so-called Stansted 15, who cut through a perimeter fence, had \"placed the safety of the airport in a likelihood of danger\". Amnesty International branded the verdicts a \"blow for human rights\". The group will be sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court at a later date. One of the activists, Benjamin Smoke, 27, of Rowley Gardens, London, told the court: \"I was fighting to stop the plane deporting people to a place where they would be at risk of being killed or seriously harmed.\" Amnesty International's UK director Kate Allen described the verdicts as a \"crushing blow for human rights in the UK\". The court was told the protesters secured themselves around the nose wheel and wing of the Boeing 767, which was due to transport people for repatriation to Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone. They locked themselves together with pipes and foam, having cut a 3ft by 3ft (1m by 1m) hole in the perimeter fence. Airport security and police spent hours removing the defendants before their arrests and flights in and out of the Essex airport were delayed as a result.  The defendants had denied a single charge of intentional disruption of services at an aerodrome. Ms Allen said: \"The terrorism-related charge against these individuals was always a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. \"It's deeply disturbing that peaceful protesters who caused disruption but at no time caused harm to anyone, should now be facing a possible lengthy prison sentence.  \"This whole case will send a shiver down the spine of anyone who cares about the right to protest in our country.\" Brighton Pavilion MP and former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said she found the convictions \"absolutely shocking\". Judith Reed, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"Fifteen protesters used equipment such as industrial bolt cutters, chains, expanding foam, scaffolding poles and lock box devices to prevent the take-off of a plane. \"These people placed themselves, the flight crew, airport personnel and police at serious risk of injury or even death due to their actions on the airfield. \"The CPS worked with the police to build a strong case which reflected the criminality of the defendant's actions, regardless of their motivation.\" Those found guilty are:  Twelve of the defendants' given addresses are in north London, Burtonshaw's is in Brighton, Potts's is in Bristol and McGahan's is in Reading.",

            "text": "Flight data from the Ethiopian Airlines disaster a week ago suggest \"clear similarities\" with a crash off Indonesia last October, Ethiopia's transport minister has said. Both planes were Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft. Last Sunday the Ethiopian Airlines jet crashed after take-off from Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board. Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges told journalists that a preliminary report would be released within 30 days. \"Clear similarities were noted between Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Indonesian Lion Air Flight 610, which would be the subject of further study during the investigation,\" Ms Dagmawit told journalists on Sunday. In both cases flight tracking data showed the aircraft's altitude had fluctuated sharply, as the planes seemed to experience erratic climbs and descents. Boeing Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg later reaffirmed that the company was supporting the investigation.  In a statement, he added that Boeing was going ahead with a software update that will address the behaviour of the flight control system \"in response to erroneous sensor inputs\".   Also on Sunday, ceremonies took place both in Kenya and Ethiopia to honour the victims. Thousands of people gathered in the Holy Trinity cathedral in Addis Ababa where empty coffins were draped in the national flag. None of the bodies has yet been formally identified because of the impact. Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 took off from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport on the morning of 10 March, bound for Nairobi in Kenya. Minutes into the flight, the pilot reported difficulties and asked to return. Visibility was said to be good but air traffic monitor Flightradar24 said the plane's \"vertical speed was unstable after take-off\". An eyewitness at the scene told the BBC there was an intense fire as the aircraft hit the ground. French air safety investigators examined the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder - or black boxes as they are often called - and have handed over their findings to their Ethiopian counterparts. On 29 October Lion Air Flight 610 crashed after taking off from Jakarta airport, killing 189 people.  Investigators later identified problems with the anti-stall system, which is designed to stop a plane from pointing upwards at too high an angle where it could lose its lift. During flight JT610, the system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, even when the plane was not stalling - possibly due to a faulty sensor. Pilots tried to correct this by pointing the nose higher, until the system pushed it down again. This happened more than 20 times. Following the second crash, airlines around the world grounded their Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft.",

Australian media have reported similar laser incidents in the past, which intelligence officials have blamed on small Chinese vessels.  A statement from the Australian department of defence said the plane targeted was a Boeing  P-8A Poseidon - a marine patrol aircraft equipped with weapons systems and sensors for detecting submarines. It said the ship was one of two Chinese Navy vessels sailing east in the Arafura Sea before passing through the Torres Strait between Australia and Papua New Guinea, and into the Coral Sea. \"These actions could have endangered the safety and lives of the Australian Defence Force personnel,\" the ministry said. \"Such actions are not in keeping with the standards we expect of professional militaries.\" China is Australia's biggest trading partner, and in the past, the two have maintained good relations. But in recent years that has broken down. Australia has accused Beijing of interfering in its domestic politics, banned Chinese telecom giant Huawei from building Australian tech infrastructure and called for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19, first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Beijing in turn cautioned students and tourists against going to Australia, citing racist incidents in light of the pandemic. In September, China said a new security alliance between Australia, the UK and the US risked \"severely damaging regional peace... and intensifying the arms race\". The Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper said at the time Australia had \"turned itself into an adversary of China\".",

Sam Pegram, of Lancashire, was on board the plane when it crashed shortly after taking off from Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) told the BBC. The Boeing 737 Max 8 was flying to Nairobi when it came down on Sunday with 157 people on board. Geneva-based Mr Pegram, 25 and from Penwortham, was an NRC intern. The plane crashed near the town of Bishoftu, 60km (37 miles) south-east of the capital at 08:44 local time (05:44 GMT). Among those on board were 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians and nine Britons, of whom two were dual nationals travelling on non-British passports. The Lancashire Evening Post reported Mr Pegram had attended Runshaw College in Leyland before going on to study at Leeds University and for a masters degree at the University of York. It quoted his mother Deborah, who said: \"Sam was so looking forward to going to Nairobi. He loved the work he was doing.  \"We can't believe this has happened. We're totally devastated.\" Paying tribute on Facebook, Mr Pegram's former school Penwortham Priory Academy said: \"Many of our current staff taught Sam and will remember him with great fondness.  \"We send our deepest condolences to Sam's family and friends at what will be a terribly difficult time.\" The University of Leeds where Mr Pegram completed an International Relations degree said he was \"a compassionate and kind person\". Dr Gordon Clubb said: \"I've never been so proud of a former student - he had a real drive to help others.\"",

An Airprox report said \"a white object believed to be a drone\" appeared \"suddenly\" and \"narrowly avoided hitting the aircraft\". The pilot said they \"did not know it did not hit the aircraft\". At about 17:23 the pilot reported a drone passing down the left side of the nose cone as they descended at approximately 2800ft (832m). \"It managed to pass without hitting the aircraft,\" the report said. \"The whole event happened too quickly for any avoiding action to be taken.\" The incident was reported to air traffic control who passed the information to other aircraft due to approach the airport. \"There were no further sightings and the aircraft following all landed without incident,\" the report said.

            "text": "A Boeing 737 cargo plane with two people on board has ditched off the coast of Hawaii after experiencing engine trouble. The aircraft was en route from Honolulu to the island of Maui, but went down in the water soon after taking off from Daniel K Inouye International Airport. The Coast Guard rescued both pilots from the sea early on Friday morning. One was found clinging to the plane's tail and airlifted to safety, Reuters news agency reports. According to officials from the state's transport department, quoted by local outlet Hawaii News Now (HNN), he was airlifted to Queen's Medical Center and taken to intensive care in critical condition. Rescuers brought the other pilot to shore by boat, HNN said. He is reportedly in a serious condition with a head injury. Footage broadcast by NBC shows a man thought to be one of the pilots being taken away in a wheelchair. He appears to be conscious. The pilots knew they were in trouble. \"We've lost number one engine,\" a crew member tells air traffic control, according to a recording posted online. \"We're going to lose the other engine, too. It's running very hot.\" A Boeing statement reported by US media said they were in contact with authorities about the incident and are \"closely monitoring the situation\". The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the incident. \"The pilots had reported engine trouble and were attempting to return to Honolulu when they were forced to land the aircraft in the water,\" the FAA said in a statement. Flight tracking website Flightradar24 tweeted that it was a 737-200 cargo aeroplane operated for the carrier Transair since 2014. It was built in 1975 and first delivered to Pacific Western Airlines. Transair Flight 810 left Honolulu bound for Kahului at 01:33 local time (11:33 GMT), Flightradar 24 said, but turned back quickly afterwards, and crashed into the water after just minutes in the air. According to its website, Transair has been in business since 1982 and is one of Hawaii's biggest air cargo operators. It has a fleet of five Boeing 737s, it said. This aircraft is not the same as a Boeing 737 Max, the aircraft temporarily grounded by authorities after two fatal passenger airline crashes in 2018 and 2019 respectively. The 737 Max was cleared to fly again by US regulators in 2020, but it recently came under further scrutiny.",

Red roses were placed on 298 white chairs in memory of the mainly Dutch passengers and crew of flight MH17.  All those on board the Boeing 777 aircraft died when it broke apart in a missile strike over eastern Ukraine. Investigators last month said the missile belonged to Russian forces. Russia denies the allegation. The chairs, placed on a lawn near the embassy, represent 196 Dutch citizens and the others who perished on 17 July 2014.  Flight MH17 was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur and was travelling over conflict-hit Ukraine when it was struck.  The incident occurred at the height of the conflict between government troops and pro-Russian separatists. In September 2016, an international team of criminal investigators said evidence showed the plane had been destroyed by a Russian-made Buk missile. In May this year, the Dutch-led team of investigators said the missile had come from a unit based in western Russia. Russia insists that none of its weapons were used.",

            "title": "Iran plane downing: President Rouhani calls on military to explain",
            "text": "Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has said the country's military should elaborate more on how it shot down a passenger plane by mistake last week. Separately, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif acknowledged that Iranians \"were lied to\" for days afterwards. He insisted that he and the president were also kept in the dark. Iran's Revolutionary Guards killed 176 people when they \"unintentionally\" shot down the Ukrainian aircraft amid escalating tensions with the US. Hours before, Iranian missiles had targeted two airbases in Iraq housing US forces. Speaking on state television on Wednesday, President Rouhani called on the military to take the next steps of the investigation with \"more coordination and monitoring\". \"The first thing is to inform people honestly. People's grief will alleviate when they know that we feel responsible for what happened and talk with them honestly,\" he said. He urged the forces \"to explain to people what sessions and meetings were held since the moment that the incident happened\".  Mr Zarif, during a televised interview while on a trip to India, said: \"I and the president did not know [what brought the plane down] and, as soon as we did, we communicated it.\" He also praised the military for being \"brave enough to claim responsibility early on\". However, critics have decried the three-day delay and said they only owned up after Western authorities claimed to have contrary evidence.  New footage - verified by the New York Times - shows two missiles, fired 30 seconds apart, striking the plane. It was initially though to have been hit once.  Flight PS752 was brought down after it took off from the capital, Tehran, on 8 January, when the Revolutionary Guards - a force set up to defend Iran's Islamic system - mistakenly perceived it as a threat amid escalating conflict with the US. Everyone on board died.   The deaths and the apparent initial cover-up - when the act was denied and the crash site was bulldozed - have sparked protests in various Iranian cities. Police in Tehran have been accused of using live ammunition against demonstrators.  Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is expected to deliver Friday prayer sermons in the capital this week for the first time since 2013, in an apparent bid to ease domestic tension.   Last Wednesday, Iran launched a series of strikes on two military bases in neighbouring Iraq, which were housing US troops. It was a retaliatory move after US President Donald Trump ordered a strike in Iraq that killed top Iranian General Qasam Soleimani.  A few hours after the Iranian strikes, Flight PS752 crashed near Tehran in initially unclear circumstances, although Iran's authorities immediately blamed technical difficulties.  On Thursday, various Western powers - including Canada, which had 57 citizens onboard the plane - said they had evidence that Iran's military had downed the plane.  Iran reiterated its denials until Friday, when it conceded that the passenger jet was hit by its air defence systems. Mr Zarif has now personally insisted that he and President Rouhani only found out about what had really happened on that day.  Brig-Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the Revolutionary Guards' aerospace commander, has said a missile operator acted independently and alone, mistaking the plane for a \"cruise missile\" as there had been reports that such missiles had been fired at Iran. He also claimed government officials had been alerted soon afterwards.  On Tuesday, Iran's judiciary spokesman, Gholamhossein Esmaili, announced that several people had been arrested.  He added that about 30 people had been detained for \"taking part in illegal gatherings\" - an apparent reference to recent anti-government protests. Also on Tuesday, President Hassan Rouhani said the investigation into the aircraft strikes would be overseen by a \"special court\" and insisted that it would be about more than just the person who \"pulled the trigger\". Iran is leading the investigation domestically and has refused to hand over recovered black-box flight recorders to manufacturer Boeing or to the US. Meanwhile, the Revolutionary Guards have also arrested the person who filmed footage that showed the plane being shot down. The video was shared on social media soon after the crash, leading analysts to deduce that the plane was directly hit. It is believed the person being detained will face charges related to national security.  However, an Iranian journalist based in London who initially posted the footage has insisted that his source is safe, and that the Iranian authorities have arrested the wrong person.",

Boeing was forced to take the 737 Max out of service following two crashes within five months of each other, which together killed 346 people. The aircraft manufacturer has since implemented a series of modifications including updating flight control software, revising crew procedures and rerouting internal wiring. Gol's vice-president for operations, Celso Ferrer, said he had full confidence in the plane's safety following the modifications. \"For the past 20 months, we have been carrying out the most intensive safety review in the history of commercial aviation. Safety comes first and foremost,\" he wrote in a statement.  A company spokesman told AFP news agency that passengers could reschedule at no extra cost if they did not want to travel on the Boeing 737 Max. \"They will be able to reschedule the trip without fees or fare difference, maintaining the same origin and destination, within the validity period for the ticket, which is 12 months from the date of purchase,\" the spokesman said. The resumption of commercial flights is a boost for Boeing. As well as being the first commercial airline to use the Boeing 737 Max on commercial routes, Gol also confirmed it had 95 standing orders for the 737 Max with Boeing.  The news comes less than a week after Irish airline Ryanair said it had placed an order for 75 Boeing 737 Max aircraft.",

            "text": "Surging demand for air travel and pandemic-fuelled workforce disruptions are likely to blame for a string of close calls on US airport runways. That's according to leaders in the aviation industry, who met on Wednesday at an impromptu safety summit to address the spate of recent incidents. The gathering took place a day after the launch of yet another federal probe into a near-collision between planes. It is the seventh aviation incident to be investigated this year alone. Federal officials are currently reviewing six \"runway incursions\" - as well as one plane's terrifying nosedive and near-plunge into the Pacific Ocean - for root causes and commonalities. The latest near-miss occurred on 7 March at Washington DC's Reagan National Airport, when a Republic Airways flight crossed a runway without clearance and forced a United Airlines flight that had already been cleared for departure to abort its take-off. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which is investigating the incident, said an air traffic controller had intervened to safely re-route the United pilot. Officials at Wednesday's FAA-hosted safety summit in the Washington area agreed there had been an \"uptick\" in incidents, with several calling for the near-misses to be treated like real accidents. \"The absence of a fatality or an accident doesn't mean the presence of safety,\" said Jennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. \"There's always more we can do to improve safety.\" The emergency summit - the first of its kind in 14 years, according to CBS News - is seen as a \"call to action\" for the industry and an opportunity to assess whether regulatory change is needed. \"In light of these recent close calls and the attention being focused on even the most routine of go-arounds, are we emphasising efficiency over safety?\" acting FAA administrator Billy Nolen asked those attending. \"America's aviation safety net is strong... our obligation is to sew those threads even tighter,\" he said. But the problem, experts say, is that airlines are still recovering from the tumult of the past three years. Not only did the pandemic fuel early retirements, mass layoffs and financial distress across the industry, but airlines went from haemorrhaging money at the start of the outbreak to being awash with customers desperate to make up for lost travel time. According to Laura Einsetler, a commercial airline pilot with over 30 years of flying experience, the last time the industry suffered such a serious jolt was the 9/11 terror attacks, an event she argues took the sector more than a decade to recover from. \"What we're seeing now, over the past year, is this really fast ramp-up of air travel and we're trying to quickly replace that loss of 20-25% of our workers [during the pandemic] by hiring people and trying to get them up to speed right now,\" she told the BBC. It all amounts to a strained aviation sector, she said, because elevated demand for air travel is probably coinciding with an overworked and under-experienced workforce. Panellists at Wednesday's summit noted, for example, that there are 1,200 fewer air traffic controllers across the US now than there were a decade ago. \"The pressure is always there to get as many of us in and out of the airports as possible,\" Mrs Einsetler added. \"We need to slow down and be situationally aware.\" Data from the FAA shows that, while the most serious airline close calls have declined over the past two decades and there have been no fatal commercial flight accidents since 2009, the total number of incidents has grown. Nevertheless safety experts insist it remains safe to fly in the US, arguing that widely reported recent near-misses only account for a fraction of the 45,000 flights that take place every day. \"We in the US have a very safe air transportation system,\" said Dr Hassan Shahidi, president and CEO of the independent Flight Safety Foundation non-profit. \"What we need to do is to make sure that we understand the root causes of these incidents and that the industry is coming together to address them in the near-term.\"",

            "title": "Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 pilots 'could not stop nosedive'",
            "text": "The Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed last month nosedived several times before it hit the ground, a preliminary report has said. Pilots \"repeatedly\" followed procedures recommended by Boeing before the crash, according to the first official report into the disaster. Boeing's boss has admitted for the first time a failure in the jet's anti-stall system was a factor in the crash.  Flight ET302 crashed after take-off from Addis Ababa, killing 157 people. Despite their efforts, pilots \"were not able to control the aircraft\", Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges said. It was the second crash of a Boeing 737 Max aircraft in five months. Last October, Lion Air flight JT 610 crashed into the sea near Indonesia killing all 189 people on board. In a news conference in Addis Ababa, Ms Dagmawit said: \"The crew performed all the procedures repeatedly [that were] provided by the manufacturer but were not able to control the aircraft.\" The 737 Max family of aircraft was grounded following the Ethiopian Airlines crash, a move affecting more than 300 planes. The preliminary report did not attribute blame for the crash. But it says the crew were fully qualified to conduct the flight, and that they performed all the expected procedures correctly.  The report goes on to recommend that Boeing review the 737 Max's \"flight control system related to flight controllability\" and that aviation regulators ensure this is done before the aircraft goes back into the air. Crash investigators have focused their attention on the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) - software designed to help prevent the 737 Max from stalling.  The software reacts when sensors in the nose of the aircraft show the jet is climbing at too steep an angle, which can cause a plane to stall.  The report does not mention the MCAS by name, but it does detail during the minutes after take off the problems the pilots were having in trying to control the aircraft's angle of flight.  At one point the captain called out three times \"pull up\", and seconds after instructed the first officer to tell Air Traffic Control that they had a flight control problem. In a statement on Thursday, the chief executive of Ethiopian Airlines, Tewolde GebreMariam, said he was \"very proud\" of the pilots' \"high level of professional performance\". \"It was very unfortunate they could not recover the airplane from the persistence of nosediving,\" the airline said in a statement. An investigation into the Lion Air flight suggested the system malfunctioned, and forced the plane's nose down more than 20 times before it crashed into the sea. The preliminary report from Indonesian investigators found that a faulty sensor on the aircraft wrongly triggered MCAS without the pilots' knowledge. Boeing has been working on an upgrade of the MCAS software since the Lion Air crash. It has said the system can be disabled - allowing pilots to regain control if there appears to be a problem. But the latest comments from Ethiopian officials suggest that pilots could not regain control, despite following procedures recommended by Boeing. By Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent Two crashes, five months apart, with a total of 346 people dead. Both preliminary crash reports suggest a new design to the 737 Max 8 malfunctioned, pushing each plane repeatedly into a nosedive.  One lawsuit has been filed. More are likely.  The suffering of those who've lost loved ones can't be quantified. But the commercial toll for the manufacturer and damage to its reputation, at this stage, can't be either.  Hundreds of 737 Maxs are grounded worldwide. Thousands of orders are, for now on ice, and some could even be in jeopardy.  The Max was Boeing's answer to Airbus' A320: a single-aisle, fuel-efficient short-haul plane.  But in the opinion of one experienced 737 pilot, the new anti-stall system, which was added to the aircraft and contributed to both crashes, was \"flawed\".  Boeing is working to fix it. It needs to get the aircraft certified as safe and back in the air as soon as it can. Read more from Tom here. In a statement on Thursday, Boeing's chairman and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said that following the release of the report it was \"apparent\" that in both flights, the MCAS software was \"activated in response to erroneous angle of attack information\". He added: \"As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high workload environment. It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it and we know how to do it.\" Earlier, Boeing said in a statement: \"To ensure unintended MCAS activation will not occur again, Boeing has developed and is planning to release a software update to MCAS and an associated comprehensive pilot training and supplementary education program for the 737 MAX.\" The company said the update \"adds additional layers of protection and will prevent erroneous data from causing MCAS activation. Flight crews will always have the ability to override MCAS and manually control the airplane\". Boeing has issued guidance to pilots on how to manage MCAS, and it plans to install an extra warning system on all 737 Max aircraft, which was previously an optional safety feature. It is also revising pilot training to provide \"enhanced understanding of the 737 Max\" flight system and crew procedures. The plane-maker says the upgrades are not an admission that MCAS caused the crashes.",

ADS Group said it was now able to track \"the very real economic damage being caused\" by the continuing uncertainty over the UK's exit from the EU. Its warning comes as insurance trade body, the ABI, said a no-deal Brexit \"would be a be an unforgivable act of economic and social self-harm\". The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, but no deal is yet in place. Prime Minister Theresa May is facing growing pressure to delay Brexit if no deal is agreed by then. ADS, the aerospace and defence trade group, represents some of the largest companies operating in the UK, including Airbus, Boeing and BAE Systems. Chief executive Paul Everitt said its members needed a \"firm transition period and negotiations on the UK's future relationship with the European Union commenced at the earliest opportunity\". His comments come amid growing anger among many business groups over the continuing uncertainty. Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, is expected to suggest at a dinner on Monday evening that \"as a last resort\" Brexit should be subject to a short delay if no deal is the only alternative. Mr Evans will say that any future arrangement with the EU that required the UK to comply with rules over which it had no say could be \"weaponised by those in the EU that want to\u2026 damage the UK\". On Sunday, Mrs May announced that MPs will be able to have a fresh vote on the Brexit deal by 12 March, prompting expressions of dismay by several business groups. CBI deputy director general Josh Hardie described it as \"the latest signal to businesses that no-deal is hurtling closer\". \"It must be averted. Every day without a deal means less investment and fewer jobs created,\" he said. British Chambers of Commerce director general Dr Adam Marshall said: \"Delaying the vote until just two weeks before the UK's planned departure from the EU raises serious concerns about the timeline of the parliamentary process, and whether there is sufficient window to reach an agreement and pass the necessary legislation to avoid a no-deal exit.\" And the Institute of Directors' interim director general, Edwin Morgan, said: \"There is too much at stake to run down the clock and risk an accidental no-deal. We sincerely hope this is the last and final date change.\" He added: \"Businesses have lost all faith in the political process and as those first in the firing line of no-deal, they deserve to know more.\"",

            "text": "The US has ruled that Canada's Bombardier received government subsidies and sold C-Series jets below cost in the US, a step likely to lead to steep tariffs. The US Commerce Department investigated the aerospace firm's US sales after a petition from rival American company Boeing. The conflict has the potential to lead to job losses in Northern Ireland. Bombardier said it was \"deeply disappointed\" in the decision.  The dispute has contributed to escalating trade tensions between the US and Canada.  The fight stems from a 2016 sale of 75 C-Series jets to Delta Air Lines. Boeing claims Delta paid $20m per plane, well below an estimated cost of $33m and what Bombardier charges in Canada. Bombardier employs about 1,000 people in Belfast linked to the C-Series. The Unite union in the UK called the Commerce Department decision \"nakedly political\", adding it had the potential to \"crush jobs, not only in Northern Ireland but in the US too\". \"More than 50 percent of C-Series components are sourced from the US, where the supply chain sustains 22,000 US jobs. The economic impact of these tariffs would be felt in communities on both sides of the Atlantic,\" said Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner. \"Boeing is using its meritless complaint as cover to close the US market, which is one of the biggest in the world, to new entrants such as Bombardier's C-Series aircraft.\" The Commerce Department's final determination on Wednesday set trade duties of about 292% - slightly lower than a preliminary finding. The inquiry now moves to the US International Trade Commission, which will examine if the dumping and subsidies caused injury to Boeing. It is expected to make a final decision in February 2018, which would trigger the duties. This week, Canada's ambassador to the US warned that it might take the fight to the World Trade Organization, if the US continues to side with Boeing. Earlier this month Canada scrapped plans to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets, underlining Canada's anger over the trade challenge. On Wednesday, Bombardier said the Commerce Department had not taken into account Bombardier's plan to build a facility in the US, as part of a planned partnership with Airbus. \"This facility will provide US airlines with a US-built plane thereby eliminating any possibility of harm due to imports,\" said spokesman Mike Nadolski. \"Unfortunately, the Commerce Department decision is divorced from this reality and ignores long-standing business practices in the aerospace industry, including launch pricing and the financing of multibillion dollar aircraft programs.\"   The Commerce Department said it will collect the duties from the importer, if the US commission finds against Bombardier. Delta has said it plans to move forward with the order, but does not expect to pay the tariffs. ",

Footage shows the aircraft striking each other at a low altitude, breaking one of the aircraft in half. A fireball can be seen as it hits the ground. The planes - one of them a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress - were taking part in a commemorative air show near Dallas.  Firefighters said there were no injuries among people on the ground. \"According to our Dallas County Medical Examiner, there are a total of six fatalities from yesterday's Wings over Dallas air show incident,\" Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said in a tweet on Sunday. The Allied Pilots Association, which represents American Airlines pilots, said Terry Barker and Len Root - two of its former members - were among those who died in the collision.   Eyewitness Chris Kratovil - who was one of between 4,000 and 6,000 who had gathered to watch the Wings Over Dallas Airshow on Saturday - told the BBC he had \"never seen a crowd grow more quiet or more still in just a blink of an eye\". \"It went from being a fairly excited, energetic crowd... to complete silence and stillness, and a lot of people, including myself, turned their children towards them and away from the airfield because there was burning wreckage in the middle of the airfield.\"  The Federal Aviation Administration said it will investigate the crash at the three-day event, which describes itself as the US's premiere WW2 air show and was being held in honour of Veterans Day, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson called it a \"terrible tragedy\".  \"The videos are heart-breaking,\" he tweeted. \"Please, say a prayer for the souls who took to the sky to entertain and educate our families today.\" The number of casualties are not yet confirmed, he said, but added that nobody on the ground had been reported injured. The event's website states that several planes had been scheduled to do a flyover demonstration on Saturday.  The B-17 bomber played a major role in winning the air war against Germany in WW2. The second plane, a P-63 Kingcobra, was a fighter aircraft used in the same war, but used in combat only by the Soviet Air Force.  The B-17 usually has a crew of about four to five people, while the P-63 has a single pilot, said Hank Coates, from the Commemorative Air Force which organised the event. \"This was a WW2 flight demonstration type air show where we highlight the aircraft and their capabilities,\" he told reporters.

            "text": "US aviation regulators have defended their response to two fatal Boeing 737 Max plane crashes. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) told the BBC that it didn't have the information needed to ground the 737 Max after the Lion Air crash. Civil aviation authorities from 33 countries gathered in Texas on Thursday to discuss when the current  grounding order should be lifted. The FAA said it was making sure that the 737 Max was \"as safe as possible\". An Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed in March, killing all 157 people on board. It followed the Lion Air disaster in Indonesia in October, in which 189 people died. Boeing grounded its entire global fleet of 737 Max aircraft in March after the two crashes.  \"After the Lion Air crash, we didn't have the information or data we needed to ground an aircraft,\" Dan Elwell, the FAA's acting administrator told the BBC. \"The action that we took after the Lion Air accident was sufficient to make sure that the world... if that happened again, could handle it, that the crews and operators could handle it.\" Mr Elwell said that he could not comment on the active investigations into the two crashes, and that the FAA, together with international aviation authorities, was examining links found between the interim reports into each plane crash.  \"I'm confident that, working together, we're going to fix it, and the 737 will go on to be as the 737 varieties before it - the safest planes in the sky.\" The FAA has not set out a timetable for when the 737 Max will return to service.  Mr Elwell said if it took a year for the grounding order to be lifted \"so be it\". The regulator said that during the meeting, it would provide its \"safety analysis that will form the basis for our return to service decision process\". The FAA also said it \"will provide safety experts to answer any questions participants have related to their respective decisions to return the fleet to service\". At the same time as the FAA is meeting regulators in Texas, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) is holding a separate meeting in Montreal, Canada, with 737 Max airline operators from across the world.  Earlier, officials for American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines told Reuters that once the order is lifted, it would take between 100-150 hours of preparation before the grounded 737 Max planes will be ready for flying. Boeing has developed a software update for the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (Mcas) on the 737 Max - a new feature on the jet designed to improve the handling of the plane and to stop it pitching up at too high an angle. Mcas has been linked to both the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March, which killed 157 passengers and crew, and the Lion Air disaster in Indonesia at the end of October, in which 189 people perished. However, Boeing has not formally submitted the software fix to the FAA. Mr Elwell said: \"We're going to make sure that when the 737 Max flies again, that the Mcas system and the inputs that make the Mcas system activate are refined in a way that makes the aircraft as safe as possible.\"",

Cranfield University, in Bedfordshire, and the University of Greenwich, London, are looking for hundreds of volunteers to take part in a trial. By studying what people do, the findings will look to improve safety measures, organisers said. Four hundred recruits will be filmed as they leave a stationary Boeing 737 at Cranfield's Digital Aviation Research and Technology Centre. \"Researchers will explore the choices made by passengers during evacuation scenarios and investigate the influence of the cabin design upon participants' decisions,\" organisers said. Zuzana Chin, from Cranfield University, said: \"Understanding human behaviour during aircraft evacuation scenarios is crucial for enhancing safety measures.\" The study will analyse choices made by participants aged 18 to 65. Volunteers need to register for the sessions between 15 and 20 August. They will board the demonstration plane and experience an evacuation scenario, but emergency slides will not be used. They will be filmed as they are told to leave their seats and make their way to an exit door.  Following the evacuation, they will answer a number of questions including why they chose a certain seat and why they went to a particular exit.

WestJet airlines said its Boeing 737-800 carrying 168 passengers and six crew was waiting for a gate when it was hit by a Sunwing plane. Video showed a fire near the Sunwing plane's tail and WestJet passengers sliding down emergency chutes. All passengers were evacuated and safe, WestJet said. The plane had arrived at Toronto Pearson from the resort of Cancun in Mexico and was stationary when the collision took place, the airline said. WestJet said on Twitter: \"Due to the position of the aircraft on the laneway, WestJet guests required evacuation via emergency slide.\"  Emergency crews responded immediately, the statement added. Pearson Airport said on Twitter that fire and emergency crews had responded to an \"incident involving two aircraft\" at its Terminal 3, and that passengers had been evacuated.  Sunwing said its plane was being towed by its ground handling service provider at the time and there were no passengers or crew on board. The evacuation took place as temperatures in the city dropped to -21 C. Eyewitnesses posted pictures of the incident on social media.",

            "title": "A380: Last of the superjumbos handed to new owner",
            "text": "The final Airbus A380 ever to be built has been handed over to its new owners, the Dubai-based carrier Emirates. It is a landmark moment. The giant of the skies will continue to fly, but its long-term future remains uncertain. Emirates, which owns roughly half of the A380 fleet, looks set to continue using it for many years to come.  But several other airlines stopped using their plane during the pandemic, and some have already been scrapped. The A380 is the world's largest passenger jet. In standard configuration, it carries 545 passengers - although in theory it can carry a maximum of 853. The double-decker colossus has four engines, an 80-metre wingspan and a maximum take-off weight of 560 tonnes. It is also very complex - containing around 530km (330 miles) of wiring. Yet according to Alex Scerri, a former A380 Captain, it is remarkably easy to fly. \"Airbus have managed to engineer the A380 so that it feels just like a much smaller plane like the A320,\" he says. \"It's remarkably nimble, and it really doesn't feel like a 600-tonne aircraft.\" The project was conceived in the early 1990s. The A380 was meant to be a symbol of European industrial prowess, a flagship for the Airbus fleet to surpass Boeing's 747 jumbo. At the time, it was widely assumed that major airport hubs around the world would become more and more congested as cities grew and air traffic multiplied. This would create a market for very large planes which could carry more passengers without increasing the number of flights. By the time the A380 made its first commercial flight in 2007, however, the seeds of its demise had already been sown.  While Airbus engineers struggled to get the superjumbo onto the market, Boeing was quietly marketing long range versions of its economical twin-engine 777 - and developing the 787 Dreamliner.  The 787 was a design which made the most of advances in engine technology, as well as in composite materials and aerodynamics. The result was an aircraft that was much more efficient than previous models, used less fuel and was therefore cheaper to run.  Together with Airbus' own A350, launched a few years later, it changed the shape of the market.  Instead of using giant planes to transport huge numbers of people between 'hub' airports, before placing them on connecting flights to other destinations, airlines could now fly smaller planes on less crowded direct routes between smaller cities which would previously have been unviable. Compared with these new designs, the four-engine A380 was expensive to buy and costly to run.  \"The technology on the A380 was basically from the 1980s,\" says Peter Morris, chief economist at the aviation consultancy Ascend by Cirium. \"It was frozen into the design before the step-change in aircraft technology - before carbon composites and highly efficient engines\". As a result, Airbus struggled to sell it. Only 251 planes were ever built, and the programme struggled to break even - let alone recoup the more than $25bn invested in it. Yet according to Airbus executive Philippe Muhn, the project still brought significant benefits to the organisation, which had developed from a grouping of manufacturers from different countries. \"This was an aircraft that allowed the company to integrate, from a technical standpoint, industrial standpoint, and culturally as well\", he explains. \"And then of course all the investment in the A380 technology was the foundation of what the A350 is today.\" But, while it may have been a commercial failure for Airbus, the superjumbo has clearly been a success for its primary customer.  Emirates used it to create a global network of high-density, long-haul routes centred on its base in Dubai. That helped it to become one of the world's largest airlines. \"For Emirates it created a niche in the market\", explains Peter Morris. \"Without the A380, I contend that Emirates would never have reached the level that it did. They managed to make something which helped build the prestige of Dubai, and created a market for the plane as well. It did work.\" But for other airlines, the superjumbo was less of a success. Filling all of those seats could be a challenge - and when the Covid pandemic hit, virtually the entire fleet was grounded. While some carriers are now bringing them back, others, such as Lufthansa and Air France have decided to retire their fleets for good.  That raises the question of what will happen to the unused planes. In theory, they could fly for decades. But according to Ascend by Cirium, the second-hand market for such large aircraft is \"small to non-existent\".  It is likely, then, that more A380s will simply go to the scrapyard, following the seven that have already reportedly been sent. But others will remain in service. Emirates, which now has 123 A380s, says it will continue to fly them for the next two decades - though over time their number is likely to shrink as newer planes are brought in. However long it continues to fly, aviation historian Shea Oakley thinks the superjumbo has already sealed its place in history. \"Tragically for Airbus, they built a technological masterpiece, but they chose the wrong vision. It was a fine aircraft, but the wrong choice for the times\", he says. \"I'm not sure there will ever be a larger commercial aircraft than the A380.\"",

            "title": "Bombardier: Belfast workers to press MPs on Boeing row",
            "text": "MPs have joined Bombardier workers outside the Houses of Parliament in a campaign to protect jobs in Belfast. The workers, along with the trade union, Unite, displayed a large banner stating \"#BackBombardier\". Bombardier, a Canadian aerospace company, is in a trade dispute with rival firm Boeing over alleged below-cost selling of its C-Series jet. The Bombardier workers held an hour-long meeting with Business Secretary Greg Clark on Wednesday evening. Coming after a day of meetings with MPs, a union official told BBC News NI that Mr Clark \"listened, but we now expect action\". The row threatens jobs at Bombardier's Belfast plant, where parts of the C-Series jet, including the wings, are made. Bombardier employs more than 4,000 people in Northern Ireland - and is one of its biggest private sector employers. Last week, the US government imposed an import tax of 80% on the jets, on top of a 220% tariff that had already been set. The ruling, which could triple the cost of a C-Series aircraft sold into the US, could potentially jeopardise a major order placed last year from US airline Delta - a $5.6bn (\u00a34.15bn) deal for up to 125 of the jets. Delta's Chief Executive Ed Bastian said on Tuesday the carrier would not foot the bill of the proposed tariff. The company still intends to take the C-Series but there may be a delay as it works through the issues with Bombardier, he said, adding that Delta would get the planes \"at the agreed contractual price\". Prime Minister Theresa May spoke to US President Donald Trump on Tuesday night and discussed the importance of Bombardier jobs to Northern Ireland. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, speaking during Prime Minister's Question Time and sporting a 'back Bombardier' badge, said \"Bombardier workers facing redundancy\" was one of the government's failings.  Wednesday's round of London meetings is all about keeping the Bombardier issue on the national agenda. The government has already taken the side of the Canadian firm in its dispute with Boeing. The DUP, whose support Theresa May relies on, is also ensuring it gets high-level attention. But is this something which has the potential to threaten the supply and confidence deal? Highly unlikely. The DUP is clear the real villains of the piece are Boeing and President Trump's Commerce Department, not the government it props up. Speaking at the Westminster protest, Bombardier employee Dougie Jamison said it was important to remind MPs \"how it is going to affect people on the ground\". \"It is not just people in Canada or in Belfast - it is throughout Northern Ireland that this is going to affect people,\" he added. Unite's regional secretary Jimmy Kelly said the intention was to \"impress on the government\" that it must do more on the issue. \"It is not good enough to just phone Donald Trump,\" said Mr Kelly. \"We need the government to speak to Boeing in a way that makes them realise their contracts with them are under threat.\" The group will call on the prime minister to summon Boeing to a summit with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. On Tuesday, the government accused of \"inaction\" over the potential job losses. But Mr Clark told the House of Commons that he understood the worry felt by the workforce, adding that the government would \"vigorously and robustly defend\" Bombardier's interests.",

            "title": "Airline giant Delta warns oil increases mean higher ticket prices",
            "text": "Higher oil prices are set to lead to a 10% increase in air fares, according to the boss of one of the world's biggest airlines. Delta Air Lines head Ed Bastian told the BBC the final impact \"really depends where fuel prices settle\". Oil prices have reached 14-year highs after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Emirates, Japan Airlines and AirAsia are among the big carriers to introduce surcharges on their tickets recently to cover the higher cost of jet fuel.  Before the pandemic, in 2019, 200 million customers flew on Delta, making it the world's second biggest airline by passenger numbers.  Mr Bastian said that on a domestic US flight the rise in fuel prices \"is probably about $25 on a ticket, that could be anywhere between 5% to 10% at these high levels of oil... and international [flights] will be a bit higher than that\".  Delta is planning to introduce fuel surcharges on the international flights which account for about 35% of its business, and increase US ticket prices. Jet fuel is one of the biggest costs for airlines. Michael O'Leary, the boss of Europe's biggest carrier Ryanair, said recently that the surge in oil prices would lead to \"materially higher\" airfares this summer.  Many airlines try to protect themselves from these changes by buying fuel in advance. Easyjet and British Airways both said recently that they had done so for 60% of their fuel needs this year. This year has seen big fluctuations. At the start of January, Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil - was under $80 a barrel, but it recently reached as high as almost $130 as the US and UK said they would end their use of oil from the world's biggest exporter, Russia. More price swings are likely in the short-term according to the executive director of the International Energy Agency, Dr Fatih Birol. He told the BBC: \"I think the $100 [oil] we are experiencing today may not be the highest level of prices we'll be seeing in the next weeks\". He warns that will be felt across all areas of the global economy, because as well as higher transport costs it will lead to more expensive heating and electricity. That would exacerbate the cost of living crisis many countries are facing. Reports from India suggest it is considering tackling high prices at the petrol pumps by buying discounted Russian oil. Many won't purchase it because of western sanctions, and Dr Birol warned: \"One shouldn't forget that every single dollar for oil going to [the] Russian economy will go back as a tank or as a bullet to Ukrainian people. One shouldn't forget this moral aspect in my view\". Instead he wants Middle Eastern countries including Saudi Arabia to increase oil production. The latest IEA forecast says three million barrels a day of Russian oil could be removed from the market. However, that drop in supply could be offset by a fall in demand from China where Covid has led to new lockdowns.  All this unpredictability means Delta does not try to buy its fuel in advance, Mr Bastian said. \"Sometimes you win, and often you lose.\" Instead Delta has the protection of owning its oil refinery in Pennsylvania, although it has been unsuccessful in recent efforts to try to sell it. \"We're thrilled that we have it right now\" says Mr Bastian. The Delta chief is also looking to a future where initiatives to tackle climate change by cutting aviation's carbon emissions mean oil prices are less of a concern. \"The existing fossil fuel and jet fuel technology needs to go, and we need to make those investments for the future towards a sustainable future.\" This means moving towards sustainable fuels such as biofuels or synthetic alternatives made through chemical processes. Mr Bastian says that cost is the big impediment, with the production of such substitutes costing \"three to five times what's in the marketplace today\".  The difference will need to be made by governments investing in scaling up production.  \"Scale will bring costs down over time, and will bring more capital from private sources into exploration and looking for new technology. This next five years is critical that to make sure we get government support, not just in the US but around the world.\" Returning to profitability after the losses of the pandemic will also help fund the development of new technologies. According to the International Air Transport Association the industry lost more than $51bn last year with global demand 58.4% down on 2019 levels. As Covid restrictions continue to ease, Delta had two record days of sales last week, leading Mr Bastian to be hopeful about the outlook. \"The world is returning to travel and governments have decided that Covid is done.\"  \"We're seeing some of our largest bookings we've ever had in our history. And it's not just in the US, it's internationally as well.\" However, he adds that Asia is lagging behind other regions. Crucially demand for lucrative business class fares is also returning. It is currently at about 60% of pre-pandemic levels, but Mr Bastian expects this to rise to 70% by the summer. He concedes \"there's forms of business travel that will never return, that are more efficient to handle over video technology\", but adds that leisure travellers are now showing more willingness to splash out on premium services.  Last year Delta recorded a pre-tax loss of $3.4bn and the disruption caused by coronavirus at the start of this year means Mr Bastian thinks that will be added to at the start of this year.   \"We will lose some money primarily because of Omicron, it's not fuel prices. But I do expect starting in the second quarter and beyond that we'll be profitable.\" You can watch Ed Bastian and Dr Fatih Birol's full interviews on \"Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst\" this weekend.

            "title": "Ethiopian Airlines: Flight recorders recovered from crash site",
            "text": "Investigators have found the flight data recorders from an Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed on Sunday. The devices recovered at the crash site were the Boeing 737 Max 8's cockpit voice recorder and digital flight data recorder. The plane was en route from Addis Ababa to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, when it crashed six minutes after take-off, killing all 157 people on board. Several airlines have grounded the Boeing model following the disaster. The months-old aircraft came down near the town of Bishoftu, 60km (37 miles) south-east of the capital at 08:44 local time (05:44 GMT). There were people of more than 30 nationalities on the flight, including Kenyans, Ethiopians, Canadians, and Britons. The cause of the disaster is not yet clear. But the pilot had reported difficulties and asked to return to Addis Ababa, Ethiopian Airlines said. \"At this stage, we can't rule out anything,\" CEO Tewolde Gebremariam said. \"We can't also attribute the cause to anything because we'll have to comply with the international regulation to wait for the investigation.\" Visibility was said to be good but air traffic monitor Flightradar24 reported that the plane's \"vertical speed was unstable after take-off\". The pilot was named as Senior Capt Yared Getachew who Ethiopian Airlines said had a \"commendable performance\" with more than 8,000 hours in the air. Several witnesses who worked in the farmland below the plane's flight path told the Reuters news agency they heard loud rattling noises coming from the aircraft and saw billows of smoke and debris in its wake as it made a low turn over the fields. \"When it was hovering, fire was following its tail, then it tried to lift its nose,\" said one witness, Gadisa Benti. \"When it passed over our house, the nose pointed down and the tail raised up. It went straight to the ground with its nose, it then exploded.\" The 737 Max 8 aircraft has only been in commercial use since 2017.  The plane that crashed was among six of 30 that Ethiopian Airlines had ordered as part of its expansion. It underwent a \"rigorous first check maintenance\" on 4 February, the airline said. Boeing said it was \"deeply saddened\" by the crash and was sending a team to provide technical assistance. It was the second crash in five months involving a 737 Max 8, and comparisons are being drawn with a Lion Air accident in Indonesia last October that killed 189 people. Following the Lion Air crash, investigators said the pilots had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling, a new feature of the jet. The anti-stall system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, despite efforts by pilots to correct this, preliminary findings suggested. The Lion Air plane was also new and the accident happened soon after take-off. \"It's highly suspicious,\" Mary Schiavo, former Inspector General of the US Transportation Department, told CNN. \"Here we have a brand-new aircraft that's gone down twice in a year. That rings alarm bells in the aviation industry, because that just doesn't happen.\" After last October's crash, Boeing sent an emergency notice to airlines warning them of a problem with the anti-stall system.  Boeing is expected to release a software patch to the system to deal with the issue, Reuters reports. It is not yet clear whether the anti-stall system was the cause of Sunday's crash. Aviation experts say other technical issues or human error cannot be discounted. There were 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians and nine Britons (two of whom were dual nationals travelling on non-British passports) on the flight. There were also eight Italians, eight Chinese, eight Americans, seven French citizens, six Egyptians, five Germans, four Indians and four people from Slovakia. At least 21 passengers were affiliated with the UN and were travelling to a session of its Environment Assembly in Nairobi. \"It is one of the biggest catastrophes we have had in years,\" Michael Moller, director-general of the UN Office in Geneva, told the session on Monday. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his condolences for the dead. \"Our colleagues were women and men, junior professionals and seasoned officials, hailing from all corners of the globe and with a wide array of expertise,\" he said. \"They all had one thing in common: a spirit to serve the people of the world and to make it a better place for us all.\" David Beasley, the executive director of the World Food Programme, said seven members of the agency's staff had died in the crash, including Irish and Italian nationals. The investigation will be led by Ethiopian authorities in co-ordination with teams of experts from Boeing and the US National Transportation Safety Board. Ethiopian Airlines said it had grounded all of its 737 Max 8s \"until further notice\" as \"an extra safety precaution\". The airline's first flight to Kenya since the crash touched down at 10:25 local time on Monday, and a different model of plane was used. Meanwhile: Shares in Boeing fell by 12.9% in the wake of the crash.",

            "title": "The new airlines betting flying is about to take off",
            "text": "The pandemic brought about the most turbulent period in commercial aviation history. Yet, over the past year dozens of new carriers have started up around the world, hoping that air travel is about to take off again. \"It's actually a very good time to launch an airline,\" says Bjorn Tore Larsen, chief executive of Norse Atlantic Airways. \"There is a huge pent up demand. People haven't been able to travel for two years or more, particularly between continents.\"  Norse Atlantic Airways is among the newcomers and will begin flying its \"longboats\" between Europe and North America from 14 June, having snapped up planes for low prices, and being able to secure valuable airport slots including London Gatwick and New York JFK. The Norwegian firm received more than 3,000 applications for its first 50 pilot jobs. \"These are actually brand new aircraft,\" says Mr Larsen, pointing to the fleet of Boeing Dreamliners on the tarmac at Oslo Airport. \"We were able to get these aircraft much lower [priced] than anyone else has been able to achieve earlier.\" Norse will be competing with established players, such a British Airways and Air France. But Mr Larsen believes there are benefits to building the airline from scratch. \"We don't have any legacy systems,\" he says. \"We are able to start off this airline in exactly the way we would like to.\" The entrepreneur, who also runs a shipping business, tells the BBC he had a passion for aviation but hadn't been tempted earlier due to the high risks involved - strong competition, typically very expensive to source the aircraft, hard to recruit staff, and difficult to get landing and take-off slots. \"When the stars aligned last year, I viewed it as a once-in-a-lifetime market opportunity,\" he says. And Mr Larsen isn't alone in spotting a golden opportunity. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), the trade body that represents the aviation sector, has described 2020 as \"the worst year on record\". With flights grounded, global passenger numbers two years ago fell 60% - down to 1.8 billion from 4.5 billion in 2019. This resulted in 55 airlines going out of business in 2020. Yet, what is perhaps initially surprising is that at the same time 32 new airlines were launched, the IATA has told the BBC. Due to much of the industry being grounded, these new carriers were able to buy cheap aircraft as prices had fallen alongside the decline in demand. Newly available arrival and departure slots could also be snapped up, and staff were suddenly available. It was a similar picture in 2021. While worldwide passenger numbers recovered slightly to 2.3 billion, a further 35 airlines closed down, while 57 new ones were launched. The debutants have taken off in most regions of the world. Avelo, and Breeze are operating in the US, where they are due to be joined later this year by Alaskan airline Northern Pacific. In Iceland, we now have Play and Niceair, while Australian newcomer Bonza, and India's Akasa, are expected in the skies soon. \"Airlines have never experienced a situation like the last two years,\" says aviation expert, Hans Joergen Elnaes, from consultancy Winair.  \"Yet, there has been a situation where a huge number of aircraft are available, and leasing rates at very attractive prices,\" explains the aviation analyst.  New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. Mr Elnaes adds that, since 2020, new airlines could also easily attract out of work cabin crew and pilots - many of whom lost their jobs during the pandemic. However, he thinks this unique window has now closed, particularly in terms of securing cheap financing. \"The once in a lifetime deals for leasing aircraft was in 2021. Those days are gone.\" Both Norse and Iceland's Play will operate low-cost transatlantic flights.  This is an areas of the market where other new entrants have failed. Wow ceased operations in 2019, while Norwegian Airlines axed its long-haul routes in early 2021.  However, Mr Elnaes reckons valuable lessons have been learned, and the current is different.  \"Both are being very careful not to be too ambitious, not to operate too many flights, before they have established themselves and see how things work,\" he says.  Another new Norwegian carrier, Oslo-based Flyr, launched domestic and European flights last summer. Its chief executive, Tonje Wikstrom Frislid, says being small and lean helped it weather the later lockdowns. \"We really had to prove our model. We've really been tested during this past winter, especially,\" she says. \"And we passed the test.\" \"Setting up a company in itself is a challenge. Creating a new airline is an extreme challenge. And we did it on Teams [video call] mainly.\" Ms Frislid adds that the availability of experienced aviation staff looking for work was a big bonus. \"You need specific competence to start an airline. \"That's not easy to get a hold of in a normal environment. This pandemic situation opened that possibility.\" Soon Flyr will operate 12 aircraft over 46 routes. \"We're going to build this gradually,\" says Ms Frislid.  Among the airline's new recruits is pilot Peter Haglehoj. \"The pandemic was quite tough for a lot of people,\" he says. \"So new airlines is good. It means more jobs.\"  With coronavirus travel restrictions continuing to be lifted around the world, global passenger numbers are now rising strongly. In March they 76% higher than the same month last year, according to the latest figures from the IATA. Yet the organisation still doesn't expect 2019's pre-pandemic high to be equalled until 2024. And just as the coronavirus crisis has waned, another unforeseen problem has arisen for airlines - the war in Ukraine. This has made Ukraine too dangerous to fly over, at the same time as Russia has closed its airspace to Western airlines. This has added hours to some routes between Europe and Asia, and made them unprofitable. More significantly, global oil prices have soared, and the cost of jet fuel has doubled since last year. IATA's director-general, Willie Walsh s has suggested that as a result higher fares are \"inevitable\". Yet Mr Elnaes says that passengers are willing to pay any higher costs. \"People just want to travel.\" He adds: \"We saw a dampening demand in the first 12 to 14 days after Russia invaded but then it stabilised.\" Flyr's Ms Frislid says her airline is flying brand new aircraft, \"which saves us about 14% fuel [compared with older planes]. So, that's also one way of handling the increasing fuel prices.\" Meanwhile, Norse has opted for a slightly softer launch with fewer aircraft.  \"We have the flexibility to enter the market cautiously and in line with demand, which is exactly what we will do,\" says Mr Larsen, its chief executive.",

            "title": "Boeing's Starliner astronaut capsule launches on test flight",
            "text": "The American Boeing company has launched its new astronaut capsule on a demonstration flight from Florida. Called Starliner, the vehicle left Cape Canaveral Space Force Station atop an Atlas rocket on a mission to showcase how it can ferry human crews to and from the International Space Station. It's the second such test flight. The previous demonstration, in 2019, encountered software problems that very nearly resulted in the loss of the capsule. Boeing had attempted to fly Thursday's mission in August last year but was forced to abandon that exercise when valves in the capsule's propulsion system wouldn't open and close properly on the launch pad. This issue still requires a permanent fix but engineers were happy to let the latest launch go ahead with temporary corrective measures in place.   \"I'm really proud to be able to say that the Starliner had a good orbital insertion and it's on its way to the International Space Station,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and programme manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Programme.  \"We're very, very proud of the team and what they've accomplished. This was a road of a lot of hard work to get here, and the team is just ecstatic about the accomplishments today.\" The US space agency, too, declared its satisfaction. Nasa has crews waiting to use a certified Starliner. It emerged post-launch that two of 12 larger thrusters used for the major manoeuvres in space were not working. But this was not a critical issue, said Steve Stich, who manages Nasa's Commercial Crew Programme. \"Overall, the spacecraft is doing really well. The communications has been excellent, the flight software has worked great, the cooling system has been working great,\" he told reporters. \"We're very excited to be here and looking forward to docking to the space station [on Friday].\"  The Starliner - which is flying without a crew for the demonstration - began its ascent on the Atlas at 18:54 local time on Thursday (22:54 GMT; 23:54 BST). The automated docking with the station took place at 20:28 EDT on Friday (00:28 GMT on Saturday), more than an hour later than scheduled. It's almost 12 years since Boeing first presented its design for Starliner, codenamed CST-100, at the Farnborough International Air Show in the UK. It was a response to the call for commercial companies to take over the responsibility for low-Earth orbit crew transportation, post the then soon-to-retire space shuttles. Nasa gave technical and financial support to both Boeing and California's SpaceX company, to help them develop new capsules. The idea was that the vehicles would then be engaged on a commercial basis whenever Nasa needed astronauts sent up to the ISS. But while SpaceX is now four crewed operational flights into this new era, Boeing has yet to run a single crewed mission in a Starliner. And a big part of that is because Boeing's first unpiloted \"Orbital Flight Test\" in December 2019 went seriously awry. The problems started with a clock error on the capsule just after launch that made the vehicle think it was in a different flight phase than was really the case. This prompted the onboard computer system to over-fire Starliner's thrusters and burn so much fuel it became impossible to reach the intended destination of a docking with the space station.  Controllers on the ground could see the problem playing out but had difficulty communicating with the spacecraft. After the truncated mission, it also emerged that poorly designed software could have resulted in the capsule colliding with its aft service section when the two were commanded to separate just prior to re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.  Fortunately, this issue was caught and prevented, and the capsule landed safely in the New Mexico desert. The post-mission review initiated a series of re-designs and upgrades that have enabled Boeing to approach an Orbital Flight Test 2 (OFT-2). The re-run is following the same planned profile: an uncrewed mission to the International Space Station. That said, an anthropomorphic test device, more commonly known as a flight dummy, dubbed \"Rosie the Rocketeer\", is once again strapped in for the ride. Rosie and \"her\" capsule will stay attached to the station for four to five days, before departing for a parachute-assisted descent and landing at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Assuming everything goes to plan, touchdown is likely to occur on Wednesday next week. If Boeing can put the flaws of OFT-1 behind it, Nasa could clear Starliner to start carrying people before the end of the year. This would finally give Nasa the two new crew-transportation systems it sought when the shuttles were retired to museums in 2011.  Kathy Lueders, the agency's associate administrator for space operations, congratulated everyone on Thursday's launch. \"But as we've talked about numerous times: we're doing this one step at a time; and we right now need to get this spacecraft through its paces, and learn some things and get it on its way to the International Space Station.\"",

            "title": "Iran plane crash: 'Human error' to blame for downing of Ukrainian jet",
            "text": "Iran has said the misalignment of air defence equipment was responsible for the accidental downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane in January. In a report released on Saturday, the Civil Aviation Organisation of Iran (CAOI) blamed \"human error\" and poor military communication. All 176 people on board were killed when the plane was hit by two missiles shortly after take-off in Tehran. Iran initially denied responsibility for the incident. But after Western intelligence officials said evidence pointed to Iranian involvement, the country admitted fault, saying it had mistaken the plane for a cruise missile. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani described it as an \"unforgivable mistake\". The Ukraine International Airlines flight was downed on 8 January amid heightened tensions between Iran and America.  Iran's air defences had been on high alert at the time. Hours earlier, the country had fired ballistic missiles at two US bases in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani by a US drone strike in Baghdad. A full version of the CAOI's report has not been made publicly available, but excerpts have been published by state news agency Fars. In its findings, the CAOI said the passenger plane travelled in a normal flight corridor, but the air defence unit that targeted it had recently moved and failed to calibrate its equipment correctly. As a result, it misidentified the civilian plane as a hostile object. The report also said the missile battery could not communicate with their command centre, and fired on the plane without receiving official approval. \"If each had not arisen, the aircraft would not have been targeted,\" the CAOI concluded. Last month, Iranian authorities said six people have been arrested over the incident.  Iran has repeatedly delayed releasing the plane's \"black box\", which holds key data and communications from the cockpit. It is expected to send the box to France for examination on 20 July, according to state news agency IRNA. There has been much speculation about why Iran did not clear the skies during the attack. A recent audio recording obtained by Canada's CBC News suggests that the airspace remained open to avoid giving away Iran's intention to attack the US air base in Iraq. The recording is allegedly a conversation between the family of one of the accident victims and Hassan Rezaeifar, who at the time was leading Iran's investigation into the incident. Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Mohsen Baharvand dismissed the recording, saying it could not be used as evidence.",

            "title": "British Airways retires entire 747 fleet after travel downturn",
            "text": "British Airways has said it will retire all of its Boeing 747s as it suffers from the sharp travel downturn. The UK airline is the world's largest operator of the jumbo jets, with 31 in the fleet. \"It is with great sadness that we can confirm we are proposing to retire our entire 747 fleet with immediate effect,\" a BA spokesman told the BBC. Airlines across the world have been hit hard by coronavirus-related travel restrictions. \"It is unlikely our magnificent 'queen of the skies' will ever operate commercial services for British Airways again due to the downturn in travel caused by the Covid-19 global pandemic,\" the spokesman added. BA, which is owned by International Airlines Group (IAG), said the planes will all be retired with immediate effect. The 747s represent about 10% of BA's total fleet. It had planned on retiring the planes in 2024 but has brought forward the date due to the downturn. According to travel data firm Cirium there are about 500 747s still in service, of which 30 are actively flying passengers. More than 300 fly cargo and the remainder are in storage. The Boeing 747 is beautiful, distinctive and has half a century of proud service behind it. But - as a passenger plane at least - it is also quite simply outdated. A four-engine aircraft, it is far less efficient than modern twin-engine models, such as the Airbus A350, the 787 Dreamliner, or even the older Boeing 777 - all of which are cheaper to run. Before the Covid-19 crisis, the writing was on the wall. Airlines such as Air France, Delta and United had already retired their fleets. BA had planned to use them for another few years. But the crisis in the industry means a future in which there will be fewer passengers, fewer planes - and keeping costs down will be crucial.  So now the airline has decided the queen of the skies is a luxury it can no longer afford. British Airways' predecessor BOAC first started flying 747s in the early 1970s. BA is currently flying the 747-400 version of the long-range aircraft. It is currently the world's biggest operator of 747-400s and first took delivery of them in July 1989. Originally, the upper deck contained a lounge which was known as the \"club in the sky\".  The British carrier added it would operate more flights on modern, more fuel-efficient planes such as its new Airbus A350s and Boeing 787 Dreamliners.  It expects them to help it achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.   Boeing's 747 helped democratise global air travel in the 1970s, and marked its 50-year flying anniversary in February 2019. A wave of restructuring triggered by the virus outbreak is hitting airlines across the world, along with plane-makers and their suppliers. Thousands of job losses and furloughs have been announced in recent weeks. Up to 12,000 BA staff, including pilots cabin crew, engineers and ground staff are facing redundancy as the airline slashes costs in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Specialist companies assess whether aircraft should be salvaged or scrapped. Often they are dismantled and their parts sold on for scrap or recycled. Most of the value is in the engines. Many are also stripped out as they have valuable interiors. In some cases, private individuals and entrepreneurs buy old airliners to convert them into hotels, restaurants and tourist attractions. Those that are scrapped can end up in giant aircraft graveyards in the desert where they are left for storage.",

            "text": "An incident, in which a passenger plane struck a runway approach light when taking off from Belfast International Airport, could have been \"catastrophic,\" according to a report. The Canadian Boeing 737, owned by Sunwing Airlines, failed to accelerate at the necessary speed. The flight, on 21 July 2017, was going to Corfu.  The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) final report on the matter was published on Wednesday. The report stated that an outside air temperature of -52C was mistakenly entered into the Flight Management Computer by a crew member, instead of the actual temperature of 16C. \"This, together with the correctly calculated assumed temperature thrust reduction of 48C, meant the aircraft engines were delivering only 60% of their maximum rated thrust,\" continued the report. The plane took off from the airport with \"insufficient power to meet regulated performance requirements\" and struck the light. Crew on the flight did not recognise the issue until they reached the end of the runway. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) only became aware of the serious incident on 24 July 2017 after the Transportation Safety Board in Canada informed the office. Neither the aircraft operator, tour operator nor aircraft commander told the AAIB about the incident, despite being legally obliged to do so. An investigation found there were no injuries and no damage to the aircraft. The flight continued to Greece without incident, but the report noted that this was only because of a lack of obstacles in the flight path. \"Had an engine failed at a critical moment during take-off, the consequences could have been catastrophic,\" it stated. The pilot, 38, and co-pilot, 45, who have over 12,000 hours of flight experience between them, had flown together twice before and both said they had felt rested before the flight. The investigation also found that the aircraft's computer did not have the capability to alert the crew to the fact that the outside temperature was incorrect. This capability now exists. The report also said the crew \"were unlikely to detect any abnormality because of normal limitations in human performance\". A spokeswoman from Tui, who was the tour operator of the flight, said: \"We are aware of the Air Accidents Investigation Branch's (AAIB) final report with relation to the July 2017 incident at Belfast International Airport and can confirm that the carrier is in agreement with the findings and has already implemented the recommended actions. \"We would like to reassure Falcon and First Choice customers that their health and safety is of paramount importance to us.\"",

            "text": "The transatlantic skies could become a little more crowded as US airline JetBlue considers launching new routes from New York and Boston to London. The 20-year old company says the transatlantic market suffers from poor competition and high fares, especially in the premium category. It would be JetBlue's first foray into Europe - it currently operates in the US, the Caribbean and Latin America. It is expected to make a decision on the routes this year. JetBlue has an option to convert some A321neo aircraft that it ordered from European manufacturer Airbus in 2016 to the long range version.  A spokesman for JetBlue said: \"We plan to announce our decision on the long range version of the A321 in 2019.\"  He added: \"Potential routes to Europe could provide us an opportunity to grow our focus cities of Boston and New York as we consider the best use of our aircraft from a margin perspective in those cities.\" Adding to speculation about new routes, the company recently told staff that it would hold a \"chat about JetBlue's vision and strategy\" on 10 April.  Last year, JetBlue's chief executive Robin Hayes said the rates that some airlines charge for business class flights between New York and London were \"obscene\". Speaking at the Aviation Festival in London in September, he said: \"When we see that, we know that we can do that a lot cheaper. We think it's a good opportunity and when the time is right to take advantage, we may very well do that.\" British Airways and American Airlines as well the partnership between Air France-KLM, Delta and Virgin Atlantic have traditionally dominated transatlantic routes.  But carriers such as Norwegian Air Shuttle, Wow and Primera have emerged in recent years to offer lower cost alternatives.  However, Norwegian recently announced plans to raise 3bn Norwegian kroner (\u00a3260m) after reporting a loss for the full year.  International Airlines Group, which owns BA, had considered making a bid for Norwegian and acquired shares in the company. But it said in January that it would not make an offer for Norwegian and would sell its 3.9% stake in the airline.",

In 2019 there were 86 accidents involving large commercial planes, including eight fatal incidents, resulting in 257 fatalities, Dutch aviation consultancy To70 said. The 157 people killed in a crash involving Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March accounted for more than half of those deaths. There was one fatal accident involving large commercial passenger planes for every 5.58 million flights, according to the report. Last year was \"one of the safest years ever for commercial aviation\", according to accident tracking website the Aviation Safety Network. In 2018, 160 incidents were recorded, including 13 fatal accidents, accounting for some 534 deaths. The global aviation industry's safest year on record was 2017. There were no fatal passenger jet crashes that year, and only two fatal accidents involving regional turboprops that resulted in 13 deaths. The study includes passengers, air crew, and anyone killed on the ground in a plane accident. The types of planes covered by the research are the aircraft used by the vast majority of air passengers around the world. The study did not include small commuter planes, and some smaller turboprop aircraft. It also did not cover accidents involving military flights, training flights, private flights, cargo planes, and helicopters. Air passenger safety was under intense scrutiny in 2019 after two crashes in close succession of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft.  In October 2018, a Boeing 737 Max operated by Lion Air crashed, killing all 189 people on board. Five months later an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed, killing 157, after which the entire 737 Max fleet was grounded.",

            "text": "Boeing shares have tumbled more than 6% after the US plane-maker disclosed a manufacturing issue affecting its 737 Max planes. The aviation giant said a supplier had revealed that the installation of fittings on the rear of the planes did not follow the standard. Boeing said the problem was not an \"immediate safety of flight issue\". But it warned it could lead to delivery delays. \"We regret the impact that this issue will have on affected customers and are in contact with them concerning their delivery schedule,\" the company said in a statement.  The latest problem comes as Boeing has been under intense scrutiny since two accidents in 2018 and 2019 involving its 737 Max planes killed 346 people.  Authorities said the accidents were triggered by design flaws in its flight control software. Boeing ultimately agreed a $2.5bn settlement with US authorities, who had accused the firm of concealing information from regulators about updates to the system. Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at Great Hill, said investors may be over-reacting to the current issue. Shares in Spirit Aerosystems, Boeing's supplier, also plunged more than 20% on Friday, following the disclosure.  But, he added, \"I can understand why it's a shoot first and ask questions later because Boeing has impaired their trust with investors over the constant and repeated errors over the last few years.\" Boeing's 737 Max was grounded for more than a year following the accidents. The company has also faced a series of supply issues as it tries to emerge from the cloud cast by that scandal and ramp up production. In February, the firm was forced to halt deliveries of its widebody 787 Dreamliner due to a problem with its data analysis. US transportation regulators cleared Boeing to resume deliveries last month.  Boeing said a \"significant number\" of undelivered jets in production and in storage were affected by the new issue, which affects 737 Max family of airplanes, including the Max 7, Max 8 and Max 8200 airplanes, in addition to is P-8 Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft. Some planes involved are already in service.  The company said it was working with regulators to conduct inspections and replace fittings \"where necessary\". \"This is not an immediate safety of flight issue and the in-service fleet can continue operating safely,\" the company said.  Delivery delays from Boeing could worsen problems at airlines, which have have been scrambling to upgrade their fleets as demand for air travel soars. Southwest Airlines, one of Boeing's big customers, said it expected its orders to be delayed by the new issue, while United Airlines said it did not expect to be affected.  American Airlines said it was still working to understand the impact.",

            "text": "Monarch Airlines has been granted a 24-hour extension on its licence to sell package holidays. The agreement with the Civil Aviation Authority means customers can buy Atol-protected holidays on Sunday. It is Monarch's second temporary licence in two years. It faced similar issues in 2016, when it was reported to be in poor financial health. If continuing talks fail, 10,000 of its passengers currently abroad could face uncertainty over their travel plans. Flight-only bookings would not be affected as they do not fall under the licence. The government's Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (Atol) scheme refunds customers if a travel firm collapses and ensures they are not stranded. A loss of the licence would mean that Monarch's package holiday business could be placed in administration within days. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is thought to be drawing up contingency plans to fly stranded passengers home. The CAA said \"The Atol renewal process is ongoing and the CAA will conclude the processing of applications from approximately 1,300 Atol holders in the next 24 hours. \"In certain circumstances this could require a temporary extension to complete this process.\" The CAA said that while it could not comment on specific negotiations, it said that Atol protection \"will remain available for eligible holiday bookings made with Monarch on Sunday\". \"The CAA will provide a daily update with regard to the protection that is available to Monarch's customers,\" its statement said. In a statement Monarch said: \"As previously stated, we continue to work on plans to determine our optimal future shape, size and strategy.   \"Our flights are operating as normal, carrying Monarch customers as scheduled.\" The airline is also understood to be in talks to sell part or all of its short-haul operation. It flew 6.3m customers last year - of which around 100,000 were package holidays covered by the Atol guarantee. The company has already said it is moving into the long haul business and has ordered 45 Boeing aircraft, which will start to be delivered from March next year.",

            "title": "Would you get on a pilotless plane?",
            "text": "How comfortable would you feel getting on a pilotless plane? That is the question millions of people may have to ask themselves in the future if they want to jet off on holiday around the world. As we move closer to a world of driverless cars, which have already been on the road in some US cities and have also been tested in London, remotely controlled planes may be the next automated mode of transport. Plane manufacturer Boeing plans to test them in 2018. A survey by financial services firm UBS suggests that pilotless aircraft not be too popular, however, with 54% of the 8,000 people questioned saying they would be unlikely to take a pilotless flight. The older age groups were the most resistant with more than half of people aged 45 and above shunning the idea. Only 17% of those questioned said they would board such a plane, with more young people willing to give them a try and the 25 to 34 age group the most likely to step on board. One of the biggest debating points around the introduction of the planes is safety. While flying is generally regarded as one of the safest forms of travel, the UBS report suggested that pilotless planes would make it even more secure. It found that around 70% to 80% of the accidents that do occur are the result of human error, with crew fatigue responsible for 15% to 20% of those. However, Steve Landells, the British Airline Pilots Association's (Balpa) flight safety specialist, said: \"We have concerns that in the excitement of this futuristic idea, some may be forgetting the reality of pilotless air travel. \"Automation in the cockpit is not a new thing - it already supports operations. However, every single day pilots have to intervene when the automatics don't do what they're supposed to.  \"Computers can fail, and often do, and someone is still going to be needed to work that computer.\" It is also clear that if pilotless planes were to become the norm, then military levels of security both inside the plane and in communications would be vital. Acceptance of the concept would also be crucial to its success. Jarrod Castle, UBS's head of business services, leisure and travel research, told the BBC: \"It is a question of public perception and people being comfortable with the idea. \"Clearly a seven-hour flight carrying 200 to 300 people would be the last part of the evolution but we also feel that machines can gradually take over and then reduce the number of pilots in the cockpit from two to one over time.\" C\u00e9line Fornaro of UBS added: \"The smaller the plane and amount of passengers, the more realistic it is to see this.  \"It is not just our view, companies like Airbus are trying to get into this world where you could have small helicopters carrying two or three people unmanned.\" Air transport consultant John Strickland believes pilotless planes could definitely become a reality, as long as certain hurdles are overcome. \"It is conceivable but would be some way off in the future,\" he told the BBC. \"There would have to be an overall focus on safety and there would be a psychological barrier to get over to win the public's trust.  \"We step on monorails at airports and travel in some driverless trains and cars, but the whole psychology of being in the air and not having humans at the front is quite a challenge.\" UBS says airlines could save more than $26bn (\u00a320bn) in pilot costs by introducing pilotless aircraft and added that such a move would save the business jet industry up to $3bn and civil helicopters about $2.1bn. More than $3bn would also be saved in lower insurance premiums and there would be chances of extra revenue from increased numbers of cargo and commercial flights.",

            "text": "India's aviation regulator has placed the country's fleet of Boeing 737 planes under \"enhanced surveillance\" after a jet crashed in China.  It said it has sent out teams \"to monitor flight procedures, air worthiness and operations\". On Monday, a China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 crashed in southern China with 132 people onboard.   Rescue teams are working at the site but it is not yet known what caused the incident. The flight was travelling from Kunming to Guangzhou when it plunged to the ground and caught fire. China Eastern Airlines has grounded all its 737-800s.  \"Flight safety is serious business and we are closely studying the situation,\" said Arun Kumar, chief of India's Directorate General of Civil Association.  \"In the interim, we are focusing on enhanced surveillance of our 737 fleet.\" India's SpiceJet, Vistara and Air India Express all have Boeing 737 aircraft in their fleets. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said it had \"no information at this time that would warrant any safety actions with respect to the 737-800 in Europe\". \"As with all with all safety investigations, we are in contact with the state of design authority of the aircraft,\" a spokesperson told the BBC. \"We will be monitoring findings from the investigation closely and take any safety actions required.\"  The BBC has approached regulators in the US and China for comment.  US plane-maker Boeing said it was assisting investigations in China and communicating with the US National Transportation Safety Board.  Boeing's chief executive David Calhoun said: \"We have been in close communication with our customer and regulatory authorities since the accident, and have offered the full support of our technical experts to the investigation led by the Civil Aviation Administration of China.\"  He added that the company would do \"everything we can to support our customer and the accident investigation during this difficult time, guided by our commitment to safety, transparency, and integrity at every step\".  There are 4,208 Boeing 737-800 passenger planes in service, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium, with over a quarter of them based in China. Boeing 737-800s, which were first produced in the late 1990s, have a strong safety record.  The plane involved in Monday's incident was less than seven years old.  Investigators are still determining the reason for the crash in a wooded area of the Guangxi hills and will be searching for the plane's \"black box\" flight recorders for information. Boeing has been attempting to recover from two fatal crashes involving its 737 MAX aircraft which claimed the lives of 346 passengers and crew. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at investment bank Cowen, said: \"Given Boeing's problems with the 737 MAX, there is some chance that consumers may not want to fly on a 737 until the cause of the China Eastern crash is determined not to be a design or manufacturing issue. \"Hence, isolating the cause of the crash will be critical.\" Boeing's share price fell by 3.5% in New York on Monday. China Eastern Airlines has set up a hotline for people seeking information about those on board. It expressed \"its deep condolences for the passengers and crew members who died\". The company's share price fell by more than 6% in Shanghai on Tuesday.  ",

The UK's Civil Aviation Authority said flights from Birmingham and London's Heathrow to Amritsar, and Heathrow to New Delhi - which fly via Ashgabat, Turkmenistan - had been suspended. The CAA acted after the European Aviation Safety Agency suspended permission for it to fly in the EU. It also flies from Frankfurt and Paris. Set up in 1992 by the former Soviet Union state, its route to Amritsar is popular with the British Punjabi population. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said the European Aviation Safety Agency  had suspended the airline's flights to and from the EU \"pending confirmation that it meets international air safety standards\".  \"This means that Turkmenistan Airlines flights between the UK (London Heathrow and Birmingham) and Turkmenistan (Ashgabat), do not have permission to travel to and from the UK,\" the FCO said. Affected passengers are advised to contact Turkmenistan Airlines to seek advice, the FCO said. The budget airline also offers flights from Birmingham and London Heathrow - via Asghabat - to various other locations such as Bangkok and Beijing. The CAA said: \"Passengers who have travelled may need to make their own arrangements to return home\". It lists Air India, British Airways, Jet Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Turkish Airlines as potentially offering alternative routes. Those who have booked but are now unable to fly will have to contact the airline for a refund.  \"Passengers who booked directly with the company via either a credit, charge or debit card may alternatively be able to make a claim against their card provider,\" the CAA said. Those who booked through an airline ticket agent, should speak to the agent in the first instance, the CAA said. The was no obvious information on the company's website which also appeared to be allowing new bookings still to be made. Passengers seeking a refund for unused tickets are being advised to contact the airline directly If you've paid by credit card for your flight, and paid more than \u00a3100, you may be able to claim compensation from your credit card firm under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. If you've paid by debit card, and paid more than \u00a3100, you could try to contact your bank and ask about \"chargeback\". However, to get this form of compensation, your bank would need to claw back your money from the airline directly. If you booked through a travel agent which is ATOL-protected, you may be able to claim compensation via your travel agent. If you have travel insurance, and your insurance covers insolvency, you may be able to claim from your insurance firm.",

But they say they reserve the right to take their own decision on when to return the jet to service. It was grounded globally in March after two crashes led to concerns over its new anti-stall MCAS sotfware. Global airlines are worried that splits between regulators over the plane's safety could further damage the industry and hit passenger confidence. Boeing admits it 'fell short' on safety alert for 737 Boeing 737 Max could be grounded for months, says Iata No fixed timetable for Max 737 grounding to be lifted The decision by the European Union, China, and others to ground the Max - before the US did so - created an unusual split in the global regulatory system. EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said the European Aviation Safety Agency would take a very close look at Boeing's proposed design changes. \"We always work together with other regulators and we certainly will take joint moves, but EASA will reserve the right to take an individual look at the results and then of course engage with the rest of the regulators,\" she told Reuters media agency. There is currently no agreed time frame on the plane's return to service, with Iata saying it was unlikely to take to the skies before August. Asked how long it would take to resolve the Boeing crisis, Violeta Bulc said: \"I hope as soon as possible because we do need to restore order and trust and move on.\" In late May Canadian regulators suggested they may look to work more closely with European regulators, rather than the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), on the issue of the 737 Max's safety. The two crashes - in Indonesia in October 2018 and Ethiopia in March 2019 - killed a total of 346 people. Until then, airline regulators worldwide generally accepted certifications issued in the country where the aircraft had been built, which in this case was the FAA. Following the crashes however, it emerged the FAA had delegated part of the certification process for the plane to Boeing, putting pressure on the US regulator. There is still no broad agreement among global regulators on how and when Boeing's software fixes, which have yet to be completed, will be approved. Airline trade body, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) is meeting in South Korea for its biggest gathering since the two disasters. \"Trust in the certification system has been damaged - among regulators, between regulators and the industry and with the flying public,\" said Iata boss Alexandre de Juniac. \"While Boeing and the US Federal Aviation Administration are at centre stage, the close collaboration of counterpart manufacturers and civil aviation authorities around the world are essential,\" he said.",

This decision could potentially leave tens of thousands of passengers\nstranded. The 210- to 290-seat planes are typically used for high-capacity\nflights, affecting many passengers on cross-country or cross-global flights,\nsome of which were booked months in advance. Passengers booked on Dreamliners\ncan expect to face days-long delays, modified itineraries and crowded flights as\nairlines work to make alternative arrangements, including shifting passengers to\nother carriers and even other airports.  It is\nunclear when Dreamliners will be reinstated, but the Federal Aviation Authority\nhas cautioned that Boeing must prove their batteries are safe before the 787\nresumes service \u2013 a process which could take days or weeks.

            "text": "Fighter jets, like the Lockheed F-35, are becoming increasingly expensive. Is it possible to make something much cheaper? Angus Batey reports on a new breed of plane poised to take to the skies. At this summer's Farnborough Air Show in England, the talk was dominated by the mishaps of one plane: the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter. Due to be adopted by major air forces in the decades to come, it was supposed to be the star of the show. But in the end, the $100m-a-unit jet failed to turn up to its coming-out party after an engine fire in one of the production models grounded the fleet. But another new jet fighter, which had taken less than two years to design, build and fly, did make it to Farnborough. The Textron Scorpion costs $20m, still not exactly a bargain by most people's standards, but a fifth of the cost of the F-35. It suggests that not every advanced defence project has to necessarily come in years late and billions over budget \u2013 and points to a new twist in not only the future of fighter-jet design, but also in more humanitarian roles that a budget jet could carry out. As Textron AirLand president Bill Anderson has said, the majority of work devoted to designing and developing fighters over the last several decades has focused on creating expensive, sophisticated machines. Whether it's Lockheed\u2019s F-35 and F-22 Raptor, the Eurofighter Typhoon or the Boeing F/A-18, the designs have reflected the desire for advanced performance over affordability. Yet in today's economic environment, cost is becoming an unavoidably compelling issue for even the richest western nations. Budget busters    Textron aren\u2019t the only ones creating the tech to address this issue. The single jet fighter JF-17 is a Chinese design, currently being built in collaboration with its sole export customer, Pakistan, and is said to be available for around the same per-plane price of US$20m. Meanwhile, a Russian design, the Yak-130, has also been touted as a low-cost plane to carry out everything from air combat to reconnaissance, as well as train pilots. This isn't the first time plane-makers have offered cheaper designs. The list of current and former operators of the Russian MiG-21 \u2013 a 1950s design still going strong today - reads like a who's who of the former Soviet bloc. And other nations who have more recently bought China\u2019s modern upgrades of this old Soviet model show that cheap fighter planes are still a prized purchase for cash-strapped air forces.The US used to create such designs as well; in the 1960s and 70s, air forces that couldn\u2019t afford the heavy, twin-engined F-4 Phantom were offered the light, adaptable F-5 Freedom Fighter. The F-5 ended up serving in more than 30 air forces, and a reverse-engineered version built in Iran has just entered service with the Iranian Air Force.There are three main classes of potential customers for planes like the Scorpion, which has a top speed of around 520mph. The first are air forces who want a small jet aircraft capable of carrying out a range of strike and intelligence-gathering missions, and who have either never flown combat jets before or are looking to replace older aircraft. The second are countries who already have, or are developing, high-end fighter forces, but who might buy fewer of the more expensive jets to obtain a larger number of cheaper aircraft. The third are the major military powers who will need the advanced jets for simpler missions in low-risk environments. But how exactly do you make something as complex and technologically challenging as a fighter plane cheaper? Textron looked to its existing suppliers and used components that were already in production, rather than designing everything from scratch (the F-35, for example, uses an engine which was developed especially for the aircraft). The development team was deliberately kept very small, so Anderson and Scorpion chief designer, Dale Tutt, could make decisions quickly. \"Once we'd developed the initial design concept we set high-level design requirements for the team, and we didn't overburden them with a lot of detailed requirements,\" Tutt says. \u201cWe didn't have to invest time in developing, for example, a new engine or ejection seat. We were able to focus on putting those components together for the airplane and get it flying.\" Patrol role Textron also had the advantage of not having to meet the requirements of a specific nation or an air force. This meant that the development team could make changes to the design if they felt it would help the overall project. \"A great example is [British ejection-seat specialists] Martin Baker,\" says Anderson. \"They sent a group of engineers over and they looked at our cockpit cup design, and they said, 'Well, our seat's not gonna work. It'll be several million dollars and 18 months for us to redesign it. But if you can give us about five more inches of volume - three in length and two in width \u2013 it will work.' So guess what we did? We made the cockpit tub a little bigger.\" The Scorpion followed its Farnborough appearance with a demonstration at an exercise in Textron's home state of Kansas, designed to simulate the aftermath of a natural disaster (a major tornado strike) on the region. The jet wasn't used in a fighter role: instead it supplied full-motion video surveillance footage to ground commanders, in a role much like the one carried out today by drones in Afghanistan. Textron wants to enter the Scorpion in the competition the US Air Force will run next year to buy 350 jet trainers to replace its obsolete fleet of T-38s, which have been serving since the 1960s. It also points to additional roles, such as border surveillance, humanitarian assistance and maritime patrol, as jobs the jet can also comfortably carry out. \"Even among the very wealthy countries we're speaking to, everyone is recognising we have to become more economical,\" Anderson stresses. \"No doubt we need high-end fighters: but pilots need to fly, and we can't afford the airplanes we have and to fly the pilots enough to make them combat-sufficient. I think most countries recognise that you don't always need a high-end aircraft.\u201d If you would like to comment on this article, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our Facebook or Google+ page, or message us on Twitter.",

            "text": "To build a fleet of giant airliners requires a building just as big. Boeing\u2019s Everett Factory, built to construct the famous 747, is the biggest enclosed structure in the world. When you\u2019re building some of the world\u2019s biggest airliners, you need an equally outsized building. When Boeing decided to build the 747 \u2013 a plane so big it would become known around the world as the jumbo jet \u2013 they had to build a factory large enough to build several of them at the same time. If you\u2019ve ever seen a 747 from close quarters you\u2019ll know just how giant Boeing\u2019s jumbo is. So it\u2019s no surprise the factory which ended up building has to be very big indeed. How big? Try the biggest enclosed building in the world. You might also like: Boeing started work on the Everett factory in 1967, just as the Boeing 747 project was starting to gather pace. Bill Allen, Boeing\u2019s charismatic chief, had realised the company would need a huge amount of space if they were going to build an airliner big enough to carry 400 passengers. They chose an area of woodland some 22 miles (35km) north of Seattle, near an airport that had served as a fighter base during World War Two. An article in the Daily Herald, Everett\u2019s local paper, recalls just how out of the way the airport was. According to Joe Sutter, the engineer who masterminded the 747 project, the site had only minor road access to the nearest highway and no railway connection. In the forest roamed wild bears. At the same time Boeing was building the prototype of the world\u2019s biggest airliner, it was also having to construct the factory to make them in. Today, the Everett factory easily dwarfs any other building in the world by volume, with the Guinness Book of Records reporting that it occupies 472 million cubic feet (13.3 million cubic metres). \u201cWe\u2019ve overlaid the building over some of the most famous landmarks around the world,\u201d says David Reese, who helps runs the factory tours at Everett. \u201cWe have various famous places like Versailles, the Vatican and Disneyland, and you see them when you start the factory tour. \u201cI remember I did an interview with the BBC a few years ago, and I thought \u2018I wonder what the volume of Wembley Stadium is?\u2019 Well, it turns out you can fit 13 of them in the volume of our factory.\u201d The Everett plant still produces a dwindling number of 747 freighters, but today it mostly concentrates on the smaller 767, 777 and 787 models. To build that fleet of planes requires lots of room. Everett\u2019s main building covers 97.8 acres (39 hectares), more than 30 times as big as London\u2019s Trafalgar Square. Each shift has as many as 10,000 workers, and there are three shifts each day. Over the course of 24 hours, the factory has a population only a little less than the Australian city of Alice Springs. Reese has worked for Boeing for 38 years \u2013 11 of them running the factory tours \u2013 but says he can still remember his first impression of the factory. \u201cIt was very awe-inspiring the first time \u2013 and I would have to say every day since, too.\u00a0 It changes constantly. Each day there\u2019s something new.\u201d The Everett factory is so big that there\u2019s a fleet of some 1,300 bicycles on hand to help cut travel time. It has its own fire station and medical services on station, and an array of cafes and restaurants to feed the thousands of workers. \u00a0Overhead are a multitude of cranes used to move some of the heavier aircraft parts as the planes start to take shape. The operators, Reese says, are some of the most highly skilled and best-paid workers at the factory. There are a few rules for working in, or even just visiting, the factory. \u201cWe do require proper footwear, so no open-toed shoes and no high heels for the ladies \u2013 anything that could possibly cause a fall or damage your feet \u2013 and you have to wear safety glasses at all times in the factory. Constantly. That can be an issue with some of our visitors, they say things like \u2018Oh, I wear reading glasses, that will be enough.\u2019 It\u2019s not.\u201d The factory boasts some surprising features. While there is ventilation, there is no air conditioning. In summer, if it gets too hot, Reese says, they just open the massive doors to let in the breeze. In winter, the effect of the more than one million lights, the huge amount of electric equipment and some 10,000 human bodies also helps moderate the temperatures. \u201cI only have to wear a sweater or a light jacket and that\u2019s sufficient.\u201d There is a longstanding urban myth that the building is so large and high that clouds form at the top of it. Not quite so, says Reese. \u201cThe building was still being constructed as the first plane was being built, and one wall was not yet enclosed. We think that fog or mist from the outside and accumulated in the building, and it looked like a kind of hazy atmosphere. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing when we had wildfires nearby, it got pretty hazy inside the factory.\u201d Reese says the factory\u2019s days have an ebb and flow, the factory changing tasks as the day progresses.\u00a0 \u201cThe second shift, that\u2019s when there\u2019s more crane activity when there isn\u2019t quite as many people. \u201cWhen we move a finished aircraft out of the factory it\u2019s driven over a freeway to an airport nearby, and in order not to startle the drivers too much, we tend to do that at night.\u201d Not just the world\u2019s biggest building, but full of surprises too. -- Join 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0Instagram.

            "text": "In a year of travel restrictions, aviation-related experiences have become a proxy for the freedoms and frivolities of our pre-pandemic lives. Karyn Thomas hasn\u2019t set foot outside Australia since October 2019, but she has chased the vivid green glow of the Southern Lights through the skies just north of Antarctica. That\u2019s because the avid traveller was on the first-ever Aurora Australis flight earlier this month, organised by the company Chimu Adventures, which chartered a Qantas Dreamliner for an adventure that began and ended at Sydney Airport.\u00a0 \u201cArriving at the airport late in the afternoon with bags packed was very exciting,\u201d says Thomas, a keen photographer. \u201cGetting on the plane you had the pillow, the blankets and the snack packs, so it did bring back memories of international travel and the excitement. Everyone felt like they were going somewhere special \u2013 the same as going overseas.\u201d\u00a0 Australia\u2019s borders have been closed for more than a year because of the pandemic (this week it opened a travel \u2018bubble\u2019 with New Zealand), so the 10-hour trip offered the kind of plane adventure that is otherwise inaccessible at the moment. It\u2019s one of several such experiences that have become popular over the past year. When Qantas offered a seven-hour \u2018flight to nowhere\u2019 in October out of Sydney that flew passengers over the Outback and Great Barrier Reef, seats reportedly sold out in fewer than 10 minutes. Other airlines have launched pop-up restaurants inside jumbo jets, tours of crew training facilities and at-home delivery of in-flight meals \u2013 all of which have become hot-ticket items even as the airline industry deals with its worst-ever crisis.\u00a0 In a year of travel restrictions and cancelled plans, these kinds of aviation-related experiences seem to have become a proxy for the freedoms and frivolities of our pre-pandemic lives. And for the airlines, these new creative endeavours have helped keep brands in the public eye \u2013 and remind some of us of the excitement of flying at a time when we feel more grounded than ever.\u00a0 The rise of airline experiences\u00a0 Niche plane experiences actually pre-date the pandemic. In 2017, Tokyo-based entertainment company First Airlines began offering faux flights in which visitors entered a mock plane, settled into a fake first-class seat and used VR goggles to journey around the world while enjoying \u201cin-flight\u201d meals. Bookings were reportedly up 50% last year, but there\u2019s now competition from real airlines that have branched out in imaginative ways. Like Qantas, Royal Brunei Airlines and Taiwan\u2019s EVA Air have offered \u2018flights to nowhere\u2019. Singapore Airlines initially planned one, too, but dropped the idea amid criticism over its environmental impact. It then launched a pop-up restaurant on A380 double-decker superjumbos parked at Changi Airport, which ran for two weekends in October with meals costing up to S$600 ($450, \u00a3325). It also ran tours of its training facilities last year, and is currently operating an at-home meal delivery service that has received nearly 1,500 orders (each of which is intended for two people) since 5 October.\u00a0 \"With the Covid-19 pandemic drastically reducing the number of flights operated by the SIA Group, we created unique activities that would allow us to engage with our fans and customers,\u201d says Lee Lik Hsin, Executive VP-Commercial at Singapore Airlines. This remains the primary goal, he adds, because while these activities have brought in a bit of much-needed cash, \u201cthey will not make up for the significant drop in airline revenue\u201d.\u00a0 Japan\u2019s All Nippon Airways (ANA) has experimented in a similar way; it ran a 1.5-hour Hawaii-themed sightseeing\u00a0'flight to nowhere\u2019 in August; has sold 34,000 food sets for at-home dining; and has a new restaurant on a Boeing 777 at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda Airport, with meals that cost up to \u00a559,800 ($550, \u00a3395) in \u201cfirst class\u201d. Ryu Arashi, manager of corporate communications for ANA, explains that these kinds of activities have offered \u201cnew opportunities to generate revenue with the assets we possess, and at the same time, these ideas have been a great way to communicate with our customers\u201d. Milena Nikolova, author of Behavioural Economics for Tourism, sees these new experiences as a clever way to keep brands alive and top of mind. \u201cA crisis is actually a good time to be super smart about your marketing and maintain visibility,\u201d she says. \u201cBy finding a creative way to adapt, these airlines can work on their brand identity, which is going to be important when the market recovers because the competition will be fierce.\u201d\u00a0 The experiences the airlines are offering play into nostalgia customers may be feeling about the fact that they can\u2019t currently travel, she adds. \u201cThis is, from a psychological point of view, a smart thing [for airlines] to do.\u201d\u00a0 \u2018A tangible link to the before times\u2019\u00a0 British Airways, Finnair and El Al Israel Airlines have also offered some form of meal-delivery during the pandemic, but the majority of these new airline experiences have been launched in the Asia-Pacific region.\u00a0 Lower Covid-19 caseloads and stricter border closures could partly explain why, but perceptions of local airlines may also play a role. Residents of large nations such as the United States, which has nearly a dozen major carriers, tend to have far less affection for their airlines, says Henry Harteveldt, travel industry analyst at Atmosphere Research Group, but in some Asia-Pacific nations the situation is different.\u00a0 \u201cI think what\u2019s important to understand is that, in many countries, airlines are a source of pride,\u201d he explains, adding that to work for Asia\u2019s top carriers is considered a very prestigious job. Flying in a premium cabin is also a fairly luxurious experience, with food so well-received that some regional airlines even publish their own cookbooks.\u00a0 \u201cFlag carriers such as Singapore Airlines or Thai Airways are still regarded with a lot of respect and are viewed as an extension of the country,\u201d notes Harteveldt. \u201cThey\u2019re a bridge from that country to other parts of the world,\u201d which is why loyal customers have been so attracted to these novel experiences. And of course, while there will always be aviation enthusiasts who just really like planes, there are understandable psychological reasons why a broader range of people might want to embrace any kind of travel-related activity they can right now. \u00a0\u201c[Planes] represent the freedom to explore, the freedom to conduct your business and the freedom from being bound to the Earth,\u201d says Harteveldt. \u201cThey\u2019re a tangible link to the before times.\u201d\u00a0 Nikolova, the behavioural economics expert, agrees. \u201cWhen you think about it, planes are probably the crappiest part of the trip,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that they are an accessible proxy for the sense of being free and the sense of being able to go places.\u201d\u00a0 \u2018Felt like an adventure\u2019\u00a0 Because many of us can\u2019t \u2013 or won\u2019t \u2013 fly at the moment, Nikolova says we may be temporarily romanticising the experience \u2013 and, as a result, some people are embracing activities that replicate parts of it.\u00a0 But she doesn\u2019t believe that these activities will last long after the pandemic subsides, or that they\u2019ll feed into a renewed love affair with flying. She suspects that while we\u2019ll probably enjoy our first few post-pandemic flights, this feeling will wear off quickly as new hygiene norms radically alter the comfort of the experience in the same way new security norms did after the 9/11 attacks.\u00a0 \u00a0 Yet, while we\u2019re grounded, a big-ticket experience on a plane or even a compact meal served in an aluminium tray has proved to be a rewarding way for some people to scratch the travel itch \u2013 or indulge in a little escapism.\u00a0 Thomas says that everyone on her aurora flight from Sydney \u201cwas excited to be on a holiday, even though it was only 10 hours\u201d. Sure, they may have taken off and landed at the same airport. \u201cBut it felt like we\u2019d gone away and had this massive adventure.\u201d",

            "text": "The Soviet Union\u2019s Antonov An-225 was designed to transport the Buran space shuttle. It still flies sporadically today \u2013 but a Chinese plan could give it a new lease of life. Tucked away in a small section of a Soviet era air base on the outskirts of Kiev is the flagship aircraft of the legendary Antonov design bureau. A one-off masterpiece of engineering designed and built during the 1980s in the waning days of the USSR. The aircraft, designated the An-225, is the biggest to ever grace the Earth. It\u2019s so large that the length of its cargo hold is longer than the Wright brothers\u2019 first flight, from take-off to landing. Now 30 years old, and recently upgraded to give it another 20 years\u2019 service, the plane rarely takes to the skies anymore. Instead, it sits stagnant under an enormous steel arch. However, a crew of dedicated Antonov employees still periodically tend to the An-225. Its sporadic use has nothing to do with its age. It\u2019s grounded because there is simply little demand for its highly specialised and relatively costly service. Although the plane, nicknamed \u2018Mriya\u2019 (\u2018Dream\u2019) in Ukrainian, is in fine condition, there are very few jobs that call for something so large . And the jobs need to be urgent; if you want to use the An-225 it will cost around $30,000 (\u00a323,220) an hour. In 2016, it spent just three months traversing the globe on two lengthy deployments. The remainder of the time, it sat here at the Gostomel airport, once a top-secret flight testing airfield for Antonov. Originally built as a transport for the Soviet Union\u2019s Buran space shuttle, the An-225 was forced to find new purpose as a cargo carrier after the USSR collapsed, says Alexander Galunenko, the first man to fly the plane. \u201cWhen the USSR collapsed, the programme was shut down and the financing was closed as the need for this plane vanished,\u201d says Galunenko. He first flew the An-225 on 21 December 1988, after over a decade\u2019s service as a Soviet test pilot. Galunenko fondly remembers the bewilderment of first taking the behemoth across the world to visit the United States. \u201cWe were invited to an aviation show in Oklahoma and the media reported that the largest aircraft in the world was coming so that attracted a mass of people,\u201d he says. \u201cAll of these people just assumed that the largest aircraft in the world was made by the Boeing company. We had to tell them it was made by Antonov, and they asked, \u2018Where is Antonov from?\u2019 We said, \u2018It\u2019s a company in Kiev\u2019, so they asked us, \u2018And what is Kiev?\u2019 Well we told them \u2018Kiev is in Ukraine\u2019, and of course they asked, \u2018But what is Ukraine?\u2019\u201d The navigator of the flight eventually pulled out his maps and began to point out Ukraine to the many curious visitors. \u201cHe took a marker and circled Kiev to show them where it is,\u201d laughs Galunenko. \u201cWe got to show our plane and give the Americans a geography lesson too.\u201d The plane is effectively an extension of its little brother, the An-124 \u2018Ruslan\u2019 \u2013 an aircraft rarely regarded as \u201clittle\u201d, seeing as it\u2019s the largest military transport in the world. From a room adorned with scale models of every aircraft the company has built in its 71-year history, the lead engineer of the An-225 project, Nikolay Kalashnikov, tells BBC Future that he spent his entire professional life working for Antonov. But it was building the Mriya that was the pinnacle of his career. \u201cToday it's hard to tell, but back then it was so impressive. It was just so difficult to imagine that such a big machine can fly,\u201d says Kalashnikov. Although the An-124 Ruslan was already an impressively sized cargo carrier at that time, Kalashnikov and his team set about modifying the structure to increase its maximum takeoff weight. They added two engines, rows of landing gear, extended the fuselage and redesigned the tail in order to meet the most important requirement, to ensure that the Buran space-shuttle could be carried. At that time, the USSR\u2019s space missions were run from what is now southern Kazakhstan, at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. So the AN-225\u2019s mission was to bring the booster rockets from Moscow and ferry the Buran itself to Baikonaur. They calculated that the AN-225 programme would be cheaper than building a freeway across two rivers and through the Urals just to move these parts, says Kalashnikov. Anotonov's CEO Mikhail Kharchenko believes that the Mriya still has huge potential, despite its age, and it\u2019s not just for its enormous cargo capacity. He thinks there\u2019s still the chance to develop the An-225 into a proper in-air launch platform. \u201cApproximately 90% of the energy of the launch vehicle is spent getting up to an altitude of 10km (6.5 miles) ,\u201d says the CEO. \u201cIf we take some spacecraft and put it on the Mriya's back and fly it up to a height of 10km, then we can launch it into space from there. From the point of view of cost, the economic benefit is huge if you launch from a height of 10km.\u201d He admits it\u2019s still going to take a little bit of refinement, but Kharchenko believes this is the best direction for his company\u2019s flagship aircraft. And he\u2019s not the only one. In 2016, the Airspace Industry Corporation of China (AICC), a privately-owned aerospace and defense company, signed a cooperation agreement with Antonov for the An-225 programme. If it goes through as planned, the skies could soon be flooded by a fleet of Chinese built An-225s. \u201cThe initial idea and early stage research of the An-225 started in 2009,\u201d the president of AICC, Zhang Youshengtells BBC Future. \u201cThe official contact with Antonov began in 2011, and then from 2013 to 2016 was the acceleration phase of this project.\u201d The Chinese company isn\u2019t interested in purchasing the existing airworthy An-225. They have spent the past several years studying the feasibility of modernising the only other An-225, an unfinished airframe that has sat inside a hangar at Antonov\u2019s giant corporate campus in downtown Kyiv for the past 30 years. This aircraft, when modernised, could give China a heavy lift capability that surpasses any other nation in the world \u2013 perhaps even greater than that of the US military. According to Zhang, the An-225 would be the centrepiece of a hyper ambitious plan to add 1,000 heavy lift aircraft over the next 10 years. Heavy lift is not the only capability they\u2019re after though. \u201cThe An-225 can be equipped with spacecraft to high altitude, and can launch commercial satellites at any height below 12,000m,\u201d Zhang tells the BBC. \u201cIts launch time is flexible, accurate, and can quickly send the satellite into intended orbit, which greatly reduces launch costs.\u201d The Chinese are aiming to make their way into the lucrative satellite launch industry, which doubled revenue from 2006 to 2015, according to figures provided by AICC. The purchase agreement for the existing An-225 airframe is similar to China\u2019s acquisition of an aircraft carrier hull from Ukraine nearly 20 years ago. That hull, originally commissioned by the Soviet Union, was rebuilt and modernised over two decades until it was declared \u2018combat ready\u2019 by China\u2019s military in November 2016. If the plan goes forward, the Mriya will have found new life flying the skies for China\u2019s AICC, but Ukraine will have lost of a small but symbolic part of its aerospace industry. The men who built the plane have mixed feelings about the prospect of losing the programme to the Chinese. \u201cThe Chinese want to buy from us this plane and there's no harm in it, but of course no one wants to sell the aircraft,\u201d says Kalashnikov. \u201cThe Mriya is not separable from Ukraine, it\u2019s like our child, and it\u2019s something our children, and our grandchildren can always be proud of.\u201d Join 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0Twitter.

            "text": "When the de Havilland Comet flew into the sky in 1949, it changed aviation for good. BBC Future examines the legacy of a flawed but far-reaching design. On 7 April 1954, Peter Duffey co-piloted the sleek, four-engined de Havilland Comet G-ALYY into Heathrow Airport. It was the last leg of the new scheduled British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) jet passenger flight between London and Johannesburg. Some 36 hours later, with a new crew on board, the aircraft took off from Rome for the second stage of its return journey to South Africa. It began to climb to its cruising altitude. Shortly after passing Naples, over the island of Stromboli at the southern tip of Italy, the aircraft disintegrated. Seven crew and 14 passengers were killed. It was the second mid-air explosion of a Comet in three months. \u201cI still do not forgive those who restarted the services after the [first] crash,\u201d says Duffey, now retired and living in Canada. \u201cThey gambled and lost; I was one of the chips.\u201d The first Comet was rolled out of its hangar at the de Havilland factory in Hatfield, some 25 miles (40 kilometres) \u00a0north of central London, in July 1949 \u2013 only four years after the end of World War Two. Passenger aircraft of the time were low-flying and uncomfortable to ride. With unpressurised cabins and propellers powered by noisy piston engines, they had to fly through, rather than above, the weather. Many were converted from wartime bombers or freight transport aircraft and had quaint old-fashioned names such as Tudor, Lancastrian and Argonaut. The Comet, on the other hand, looked like an aircraft from the future, with a mirrored aluminium fuselage and swept back wings concealing four jet engines. Along each side were large rectangular picture windows to afford passengers unprecedented views of the Earth from a cruising altitude of up to 40,000ft (12 kilometres). \u201cIt still looks modern,\u201d says Alistair Hodgson, curator of the de Havilland Aircraft Museum. \u201cIt was clean, it was aerodynamic and it looked like it would slip through the air perfectly \u2013 and of course, that\u2019s what it did.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying in the aviation industry that if an aeroplane looks right, it\u2019ll fly right,\u201d says Hodgson. \u201cIt was the Concorde of its day \u2013 it flew higher, faster, smoother than any other airline of that time and made everything else obsolete.\u201d Inside there were seats for 36 passengers in two cabins. Those in first class were seated around tables \u2013 much like in a railway carriage. Apart from the cockpit, the rest of the fuselage was taken up by a large galley, luggage storage areas (there was no hold underneath) and separate toilets for ladies and gentlemen. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you allow engineers to design aircraft, rather than accountants,\u201d says Hodgson. \u201cIf you look at a modern no-frills airline, every inch of space is given over to fare-paying passengers but that\u2019s not what air travel was like in the 1940s. \u201cAir travel was just in its final days of being a thing for the rich only,\u201d he says. \u201cThe primary way of travelling long distances was ocean liners.\u201d In fact, many of the passengers of BOAC were civil servants off to run the British Empire. After almost two years of test flights, the Comet made its first scheduled flight on 2 May 1952, flying \u2013 via Rome, Beirut, Khartoum, Entebbe and Livingstone \u2013 to Johannesburg. The flight, taking just over 23 hours, was a triumph. Passengers reported a smooth journey, superb service and beautifully presented meals. With no other passenger jets yet in service, the Comet was the envy of the world. \u201cThe Comet fleet considered themselves the elite in BOAC,\u201d says Hugh Dibley, a pilot with the airline in the 1960s. \u201cIt even had its own special call-sign: \u2018Jet Speedbird\u2019.\u201d Within months, BOAC had added flights to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Karachi, Singapore and Tokyo. Meanwhile, de Havilland was notching up new orders for its remarkable aircraft from Canadian Pacific, Air France and the Royal Canadian Air Force. At speeds of up to 500mph (807km/h), passengers were experiencing the ride of their life. But for those sitting at the sharp end, there were few flights that were without incident. \u201cAll my time on the Comet 1, the aircraft was still under development,\u201d says Duffey. \u201cWe had problem after problem.\u201d The Comet was the first commercial airliner with hydraulic flying controls, which worked much like the brake pedal on a car. When the pilot moved the control column, it activated a pump which pushed fluid through a circuit of pipes to adjust the control surfaces on the wings. \u201cThe first four aircraft had faulty seals,\u201d says Duffey. \u201cWe used to carry hydraulic fluid to top up the system.\u201d Crews also reported a host of other problems. The electrics and navigation system tended to overheat. The cockpit\u2019s windows would mist up. And the aircraft\u2019s range was limited to four hours before it needed to be refuelled. But there was also a more fundamental problem with the design of the controls. \u201cNo matter what speed you were doing, the feedback on the control column felt the same,\u201d says Duffey. \u201cIt was a danger handling the aircraft, without a doubt I think that led to one of the accidents.\u201d On 26 October 1952, Duffey was off-shift sipping red wine in Rome\u2019s airport terminal after flying Comet G-ALYZ in from Beirut, Lebanon. Looking out of the window, he watched the plane begin its take-off for the flight to London. \u201cWe saw the aircraft run off the end of the runway,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo we dashed out, got a jeep and drove out to where it was and it was just sitting there hissing \u2013 it ripped the belly tank out and there was fuel everywhere.\u201d Incredibly, there was no fire and none of the crew or 35 passengers were injured. \u201cWhat [the captain] had done was raise the nose too much on take-off; it had too much drag on the wings and didn\u2019t get fully airborne,\u201d Duffey says. The pilot was blamed for the crash, but the incident also exposed an inherent flaw with the design. \u201cThe cause of the accident wasn\u2019t only the wing but the lack of feedback on the controls that allowed you to pull-back as much as you wanted,\u201d says Duffey. \u201cIt would never have happened if the test pilots had tested that aircraft properly.\u201d A few months later, on 13 March 1953, a similar problem occurred on take-off from Karachi. This time a Comet on a training flight, smashed into a stone bridge and burst into flames. All 11 crew members and technicians on board were killed. And then, in June, another plane was damaged at Dakar, Senegal in a similar incident. \u201cAs pilots we were becoming very concerned,\u201d says Duffey. \u201cAnd we started to take a very active interest in what was going on.\u201d On 2 May 1953, 43 people died when a Comet crashed shortly after leaving Delhi in India. An investigation revealed the plane had broken apart after flying into extreme turbulence. As a result of these incidents, new advisory take-off instructions were issued to pilots, adjustments were made to the wing design and future models of the plane would be fitted with weather radar. But worse was to come. \u201cThere were two fatal flaws with the aircraft,\u201d says Hodgson. \u201cFirst was the method of construction \u2013 the skin of the aircraft was made as thin as possible to save weight.\u201d \u201cThe Comet flew very high, and it needed to be pressurised so the passengers inside can breathe,\u201d says Hodgson. \u201cIf you do that, it\u2019s like taking a toy balloon and blowing it up and deflating it constantly \u2013 eventually it\u2019s going to tear.\u201d The second problem concerned the rectangular windows. \u201cIf you have a square opening in a sheet of metal, like the skin of an airliner, and you stress it, the place where the crack is going to start is at the corner,\u201d Hodgson explains. On 10 January 1954, Comet G-ALYP took off from Rome and climbed into the clouds. During a radio call to report the weather, the transmission suddenly cut off. Below, fishermen reported hearing multiple explosions before seeing burning debris plunge through the clouds. All 29 passengers and six crew were killed. All BOAC and Air France Comets were immediately grounded while the wreckage was recovered and investigations got underway. More than 50 modifications were ordered on the aircraft but investigators could not identify a single cause of the disaster. \u201cWe had a series of meetings at Heathrow,\u201d says BOAC pilot Duffey. \u201cThey said they were quite sure they\u2019d covered what was going on.\u201d The meeting was asked to vote. \u201cBy a majority of one, we decided to go back into service,\u201d he says. \u201cI voted against because I felt the modifications had not adequately discovered the reason for the explosion.\u201d Unfortunately, he was proved right. When Comet G-ALYY later exploded in mid-air on 8 April, all Comets around the world were grounded again. \u201cIt must have been an earthquake through the industry, because everyone was looking to de Havilland and Britain as the pioneers of fast, high and comfortable air travel,\u201d says Hodgson. \u201cIt was a huge mystery why these superb and futuristic aircraft were suddenly falling out of the sky.\u201d \u201cI felt so aggrieved that they put it back into service,\u201d says Duffey, \u201cthat I joined [the pilot union] Balpa on a more or less full time basis, determined to make sure we knew what was going on with aircraft we were operating.\u201d A team of experts was assembled at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough for an unprecedented investigation into the crashes. The process marked the birth of today\u2019s global air accident investigation industry. \u201cIt was obvious from the wreckage that the aircraft had explosively disintegrated in some way,\u201d Hodgson says. \u201cBut you can\u2019t just test an aircraft by making it do that again, so they immersed the aircraft in a very large tank of water and then started the stress tests and pressure tests.\u201d Over the equivalent of 9,000 flying hours, the water pressure in the aircraft fuselage was raised and lowered to simulate the conditions it would experience during flight. Then, after six weeks, the pressure suddenly dropped. The metal had cracked around one of the windows and the fuselage had blown open. It was clear that the fuselage was too thin and the rectangular windows were a source of stress. The world\u2019s first jet airliner had to be completely redesigned. With the Comet out of service, the rest of the airline industry suddenly had a chance to catch up. \u201cAll the time, your competitors are looking over your shoulder at what you do,\u201d says Hodgson. \u201cThey were all learning the lessons and coming up with designs that didn\u2019t have the inherent flaws of the original de Havilland design.\u201d With the comet grounded, the aircraft that would transform the way we travel was taking shape in Seattle. Flown for the first time in July 1954, the Boeing 707 went into service in 1958. The company eventually built more than 1,000 of these iconic aircraft. Back in the UK, de Havilland developed the Comet 2 and 3, before releasing the Comet 4 to the airlines by the end of 1958. Longer \u2013 comfortably carrying 92 passengers \u2013 stronger, more powerful and with much safer oval-shaped windows, it had a range of 2,500 miles, making it ideal for medium-haul flights. \u201cThe Comet 4 was powerful, strong and reliable,\u201d says Hugh Dibley, who began his flying career on the aircraft. \u201cIt was a lovely aircraft to fly in.\u201d Duffey agrees. \u201cIt was a super aircraft,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was beautiful to fly and land but it was too late.\u201d Although the 707 was winning most of the major airline orders, BOAC, flying Comet 4s, still managed to achieve the first commercial transatlantic crossing in a jet airliner - twice. On 4 October 1958, Comet 4s left New York and Heathrow. Although the US bound flight had to stop to refuel in Newfoundland, the London flight made the journey non-stop in six hours and 11 minutes. Comet 4s flew with BOAC until 1965 and with British airline Dan Air until 1980. The class was adapted into the hugely successful French Caravelle aircraft as well as the Nimrod reconnaissance plane, which continued to fly well into this century. The Comet 4 only finished its flying days in 1997. Duffey, who had narrowly escaped two fatal Comet crashes, went on to become one of British Airways\u2019 first Concorde pilots. The British aircraft industry never fully recovered from the Comet\u2019s dramatic failures. Today, the site of the de Havilland factory in Hatfield is an industrial park. The administrative offices are a police station, the entrance building a KFC, and the hangar where the Comet first flew from is a gym \u2013 the floor now covered in tennis courts. The only surviving original Comet 1 is being renovated at the de Havilland Museum \u2013 a small volunteer-run collection of buildings and hangars in the countryside north of London. When BBC Future meets team leader Peter Kay, he\u2019s working to re-install the ladies\u2019 toilet. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to start from scratch internally,\u201d he explains. \u201cIn places the aluminium of the fuselage had corroded so you could see holes through it.\u201d Over the past five years, the volunteers have lined the interior and have begun rebuilding the cabin and cockpit. \u201cIt\u2019s the only one in the world, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to make sure it survives and people can see it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what they were doing 70 years ago, they were way ahead of their time.\u201d Although ultimately, Boeing triumphed in the race to produce a mass-market passenger jet and subsequent generations of aircraft have made flying safer, cheaper and widely available, the legacy of this British pioneer lives on. \u201cToday\u2019s jet aircraft owe a huge amount to the Comet,\u201d says Hodgson. \u201cIt taught the lessons that the other manufacturers learned and paved the way for modern safety and design.\u201d The Comet still looks like an aircraft from the future. Sitting on one of comfy upholstered seats of the First Class apartment, it is easy to imagine what it must have been like to fly in one of these beautiful aircraft high above the weather, maybe reading a magazine or sipping an iced drink.

What you won\u2019t find is any reference to, well, you-know-what. Enjoy. \u00a0 It is 30 September 1968, and a crowd of thousands has gathered at the new Boeing factory at Everett, about 30 miles (50km) north of Seattle. They are here to see the airline manufacturer\u2019s radical new design. The 1960s has seen seismic social change, the race to put an astronaut on the Moon, the tumult of the Vietnam War and the undulations of Cold War tension. Over the course of the decade air travel has gone from being the preserve of the wealthy to something much more affordable. Key to that has been a new generation of jet airliners. They are bigger and faster than their propeller-driven ancestors, and their powerful jet engines let them fly far higher \u2013 allowing them to climb over bad weather instead of having to fly around it. That means flights to far-flung places take a lot less time than they used to. Boeing\u2019s 707 has been a mainstay of ever-expanding airlines since the mid-1950s, and there are rivals from the UK, France and the Soviet Union. The bigger jets are able to take more passengers, which means airports are having to grow just to keep up with demand. You might also like: The genesis of Boeing\u2019s new design has come not from the airliner producer itself, but from one of its customers. Juan Trippe, the chief of globetrotting airline Pan Am, has noticed increasing congestion at airports. While the number of flights is increasing, the aircraft themselves can carry only relatively small numbers of passengers. A bigger plane will help the airlines keep down running costs. Trippe asks Boeing to design something completely different \u2013 a super-sized airliner twice the size of the Boeing 707. The plane that Boeing unveils on this September day will become synonymous with the glamour of long-haul travel \u2013 the plane that can take you to sunny beaches a continent away. It will redefine the shape and size of airports, and become an unsung stalwart of the world\u2019s cargo freighters, moving vast amounts of goods across the world to this day. It will become a household name thanks to a play on its elephantine size; the \u2018Jumbo Jet\u2019. But as far as Boeing is concerned, it\u2019s called the 747. *** The beginnings of the 747\u2019s story, however, began with a little-known military contract. In the early 1960s, the US Air Force was just starting to take delivery of the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter, a huge four-engined jet designed to carry 27 tonnes of cargo over distances of some 3,500 miles (5,600km). But the air force needed something even bigger. In March 1964 it invited aircraft builders to submit designs. The new plane would have to be able to haul 52 tonnes of cargo 5,000 miles (8,000km) \u2013 or be able to take off with 81 tonnes of cargo onboard for shorter missions. On top of that, the plane would have to have a cargo hold 17ft (5.18m) wide by 13.5ft (4.1m) high and 100ft (30m) long \u2013 big enough to comfortably drive a tank into. And it would need to have cargo ramps both front and back so vehicles could be driven in or out at either end. Boeing tendered a design for this giant freighter, alongside rivals Douglas, General-Dynamics, Lockheed and Martin-Marietta. Boeing, Douglas and Lockheed\u2019s designs were all selected for further study and each of them had a different approach to a central problem \u2013 where do you put the cockpit when you have to have a cargo door at the front of the plane. Douglas\u2019s design had a pod on top of the fuselage ahead of the wing, while Lockheed\u2019s design had the cockpit and a cabin for additional passengers in a long \u2018spine\u2019 that ran most of the length of the aircraft. Boeing chose something somewhere between the two \u2013 and this would later work out to be very wise decision indeed. Lockheed\u2019s design won the military competition (their submission would become the C-5 Galaxy, the biggest aircraft in the world for the next two decades) but Boeing\u2019s submission was to influence another aircraft with a very different role. In 1965, Boeing engineer Joe Sutter, who had been working on the new 737 short-haul airliner, was brought in by Boeing\u2019s president Bill Allen to work on a new project. This was a giant airliner inspired by the demands of the military contract, and Juan Trippe\u2019s desire for a congestion-busting passenger plane. Sutter and his team\u2019s work began partly inspired by the military design. It kept the high flight deck and the opening nose doors, and the \u2018high-bypass\u2019 engines developed for the military freighter (\u2018high bypass\u2019 engines circulate the air around the turbine as well as through it, creating much more thrust for the amount of fuel burned). Sutter realised, by talking to potential customers such as Pan Am, that the airlines needed a plane that could carry many more than the 190 passengers the 707s currently plying the airways. There would be less congestion, and more passengers per flight meant the cost per passenger would go down. The bigger jets would be cheaper to run. But there was an added complication. At the time, Boeing was working on an even more ambitious project, says Mike Lombardi, Boeing\u2019s resident historian. \u201cBoeing were also building their SST (Supersonic Transport) which was supposed to compete with Concorde. The thinking at that time was when Concorde and the SST went into service, people would want to fly on them, and they wouldn\u2019t want to fly on an airliner that was subsonic. \u201cSutter realised that, one day, these planes would have to become freighters.\u201d This meant the new jumbo-sized airliner would have to keep the same configuration as the freighter, with the cockpit above the passenger cabin, because of the realisation that their days as an airliner would be numbered. \u201cMaking sure the 747 could be a good cargo airplane had a tremendous influence on the design,\u201d says Lombardi. It was an insight that would also help to ensure the success of the 747. The Boeing SST, known as the 2707, never made it to airline service, by comparison. Environmental concerns about the noise created by sonic booms \u2013 and the prodigious fuel costs \u2013 killed the aircraft before it ever flew. (Read: The American Concordes that never flew) Even before they were able to build the 747, Boeing had something else on their to-do list \u2013 build a factory big enough to assemble them. The 747 was so big \u2013 231ft (70.6m) nose to tail and a wingspan of 195ft (59m) \u2013 that it couldn\u2019t be built in any of Boeing\u2019s existing facilities. They had to build a completely new assembly plant, big enough for factory-fresh 747s to be rolled out at the end of it. \u201cNot only were they building one of the world\u2019s biggest airplanes but they were also putting up the world\u2019s biggest building to assemble them,\u201d says Lombardi. The Everett plant is still the biggest enclosed building in the world. The 747\u2019s construction came at an ambitious time for Boeing, says Lombardi. Not only was it having to oversee the 747 project (and the building needed to assemble it) and the ill-fated SST programme, but it was also building the new short-to-medium range 737 and systems used on the Apollo Saturn space programme. And all this time, Boeing was burning through cash. To help fund the 747 project it borrowed from no fewer than seven banks. Sutter, who became known as \u2018the father of the 747\u2019, fought to keep his engineers from being hived off to other projects. \u201cWith all this other business at Boeing, there wasn\u2019t just a shortage of funding, there was a shortage of engineering talent,\u201d says Lombardi. \u201cAll of the engineering talent was going to the SST project. Joe Sutter had to really fight to get engineers to work on the 747. \u201cI heard a story that he went to one meeting and during it he was told he had to give up more engineers to other programmes,\u201d says Lombardi. \u201cHe says: \u2018Then I can\u2019t build it [the 747]\u2019. \u201cHe stood up and said \u2018no\u2019, and left the meeting, thinking that that was it, he was going to be fired. But Bill Allen said to him, \u2018I really respect what you did in front of all those people\u2019.\u201d Sutter kept his job. After the rollout in September 1968 \u2013 when the world got its first glimpse of the giant airliner \u2013 the next milestone came in February 1969. Test pilots Jack Waddell and Brien Wygle took the 747 on its maiden flight from the Everett site. \u201cThere is a story that before the first flight Bill Allen told Jack Waddell, \u2018I hope you know how much is riding on this\u2019,\u201d says Lombardi. \u201cAs if there wasn\u2019t enough pressure already!\u201d Boeing\u2019s jumbo-sized airliner proved it could fly, but would the world\u2019s airliners now buy it? Pan Am was the lead customer \u2013 Boeing had promised it would deliver the airline\u2019s order by the end of 1969.\u00a0 The aircraft had had to be designed and built in only 28 months, as opposed to the usual 42 months for a new passenger aircraft. Boeing proceeded at such a pace that the first 747 was being built at its giant facility in Everett before the building\u2019s roof was finished. Other airlines decided that they too wanted a piece of the \u2018jumbo jet\u2019 action. One of them was British Airways. And a young maintenance engineer called Stewart John was sent out to Seattle to get to grips with the new aircraft. \u201cI was invited to go over to Seattle, around the [time of the] second production example, which was in Pan Am colours, was being flown,\u201d John tells BBC Future. \u201cEverett had just been built. There were two of us from BA and there were others from Lufthansa, Qantas, American Airlines and Delta. \u201cWe were doing a lot of familiarisation in a classroom. One Friday there was a whisper that went around class: \u2018They are going to fly the second one today.\u2019 \u201cSo we all went out to end of the runway. We couldn\u2019t believe the size of it. When that thing went over the top of you, it was amazing.\u201d There had been initial resistance to the 747, especially by some US airlines, because of its enormous size \u2013 there were concerns most airports wouldn\u2019t be able to accommodate it. But Boeing was convinced those airlines having to cross oceans \u2013 like those flying from New York to London and back again \u2013 would see the benefits of such a large aircraft. One major factor in its favour was the fact it could carry up to 550 passengers, nearly four times as many as the 707. On 15 January 1970, Pan Am\u2019s first 747-100 (the first 747 model to go into service) was officially christened by US First Lady Pat Nixon. The airline\u2019s 747s began flying their first route, between New York and London, one week later. But the 747 wasn\u2019t out of the woods just yet. Boeing\u2019s big spending on the project \u2013 it owed $1.2bn to banks, a record at that time \u2013 came just as the US entered a recession. The 747 wasn\u2019t cheap. Each plane cost $24m, the equivalent of $155m (\u00a3117.8m) in 2018. Boeing only sold two 747s for a year and a half from September 1970. Other airlines that had bought the plane rapidly swapped them for smaller aircraft as the 1973 Oil Crisis led to higher fuel prices. Even British Airways, the airline that would go on to fly more 747s than any other, had troubles with the aircraft. \u201cWe ordered three planes from the first 20 built,\u201d says John. \u201cThere were terrible engine problems at first. (Then) there was a pilot\u2019s strike at BA \u2013 they wanted a lot of extra money to fly them. \u201cThe planes just sat there \u2013 we ended up leasing the engines of our planes to Pan Am. Ours sat at the airport with concrete blocks on the wings, waiting for engines.\u201d Other customers found that one of the selling points of the aircraft \u2013 that it would cost less to operate because it could carry more passengers \u2013 was only true when the plane was fully loaded. A 747 that was 70% full still burned almost as much fuel as one full to capacity. But the 747 saw off these bumps. Boeing needed the 747 to be a success, so it tweaked the design and listened to suggestions from airline customers. Japanese airlines wanted to use 747s as short-range commuter jets with the maximum number of seats \u2013 550 \u2013 so Boeing made a shorter version that could carry less fuel but more luggage. The 747-200 followed in 1971, with more powerful engines and with a much higher maximum take-off weight. More and more airlines added to Boeing\u2019s order books. Throughout the 1970s and 80s the 747\u2019s distinctive humped shape became a byword for long-haul luxury. 747 cabins were spacious, and the plane even had a spiral staircase to access the upper deck. In order to encourage people to fly on the giant planes, some airlines took advantage of the 747\u2019s size to bring previously unthought of levels of luxury. American Airlines 747s had a piano bar in economy class in the 1970s; Continental\u2019s models had a lounge with sofas. Robert Scott was one pilot who flew the giant airliner. \u201cOur airline was one of the first to introduce the 747 into service and we were pretty excited to be flying what was indisputably the biggest and best airliner in the world at that time,\u201d he tells BBC Future. \u201cIt was staggering to stand and contemplate its size. It was literally like a block of flats. My early flying was in the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy so I was used to aircraft that were considerably smaller than the 747. I had flown other civilian aircraft before going to Boeing for the 747 course but nevertheless nothing came close, size-wise. \u201cDespite its enormous size it was delightful to fly. One approached it with a certain amount of trepidation from the handling point of view, expecting that it could not only look like a block of flats but also fly like one. So it was a wonderful surprise to find that it handled like a much smaller aircraft and was delightfully manoeuvrable. \u00a0It was really only when it was on the ground that one was aware of its enormous size and the care that had to be exercised, especially in restricted spaces.\u201d Airlines continued to order the 747, and airports lengthened their runways and increased the size of their terminals to accommodate it. And Boeing continued to tweak the design as technology improved. By the mid-80s Stewart John had left British Airways for a new job at Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong. \u201cIn 1986 I started talking to Boeing about whether they could do a massive change with the design. {\"image\":{\"pid\u201d:\u201dp06m9q1m\"}} \u201cIn Hong Kong we were really pushing the 200 to its limits in terms of range. We were flying from Hong Kong to Vancouver, Vancouver to Hong Kong. On the way back it took about an hour-and-a-half more because of the prevailing winds. The punishing trip was always the West Coast of the Americas travelling back to East Asia.\u201d \u201cCathay had the longest routes in the world, so Boeing sent a team to come and talk to use to see what they had to do. They came up with the 747-400 and we were the launch customer for the Rolls-Royce-powered version.\u201d The 747-400 was a huge step forward. Nicknamed the \u2018Longreach\u2019 by some airlines, it could fly non-stop for 7,670 miles (14,200km) at maximum capacity. It did this partly by adding \u2018winglets\u2019 on the end of the wings, which improved aerodynamics and meant the aircraft burned slightly less fuel per mile. If airlines wanted to, they could fit 660 passengers in an all-economy-class layout. First flying in 1988, the 747-400 was a huge success; almost 700 were sold. Many are still in operation today. \u201cCockpit and systems redesign meant that the flight engineer was no longer required,\u201d says Scott. \u201cNot only was there a financial saving with crew costs but this was a demonstration that technology was shaping the future of aircraft design like never before.\u201d A further refinement to the 747 came in 2005, with the launch of the 747-8; by now, Sutter\u2019s hunch that the aircraft would one day be needed as freighters had come true \u2013 Boeing offered the 800 as a freighter from new, rather than freight operators having to strip out the passenger cabin on planes ending their career as airliners. But by 2005, the \u2018jumbo jet\u2019 was no longer in a class of its own. Boeing\u2019s European rival Airbus had designed its own super-sized airliner, the A380; it can carry up to 853 passengers. Like the 747 before it, its huge size has meant airports have had to adapt to operate it. But the aviation market has changed a lot since the 747 was designed. Back then, no twin-engined aircraft were allowed to fly further than 60 minutes reach of an airport, in case there were problems with the engine. \u00a0Now, airliners like Boeing\u2019s 777 or 787 are able to fly as much as five hours away from the nearest airport \u2013 which means they can cross vast oceans like the Atlantic and Pacific. Air travel is changing too. The advent of the 747 and the A380 led to giant hub airports, which jumbo-sized airliners would fly between. Passengers going to smaller airports would then catch a flight on much smaller plane. It has helped to shape the classic \u2018hub-and-spoke\u2019 system that defined air travel over the last 40 years. But in recent years things have changed. Smaller two-engined aircraft are now able to fly much further; and because they only need two engines, they\u2019re cheaper for the airlines to run, so destinations are becoming more varied. It means non-stop long-haul flights from places such as London to Nashville \u2013 a distance of 4,200 miles (6,720km) \u2013 are now possible on twin-engine planes. Suddenly, giant airliners flying from sprawling airport to sprawling airport look a little vulnerable. Airbus has started seeing the effects on its assembly line; apart from an order for 20 A380s for Emirates in January 2018, Airbus hasn\u2019t sold any of its giant airliners for more than two years. And some of those who have bought the plane are cancelling orders. The 747\u2019s saving grace is that it is a relatively easy aircraft to convert into a freighter. \u201cYou can carry passengers, and if you can\u2019t carry passengers you can carry freight and if you can\u2019t carry freight you can carry fuel,\u201d says John. \u201cThe A380? You can\u2019t carry freight in that.\u201d The Boeing 747 assembly lines won\u2019t go quiet just yet, but it\u2019s likely that by 2020 most of the remaining 747s built will be cargo versions or private jets for governments and the super-rich. With it will come the end of Boeing\u2019s 50+ years building jumbo-sized jets; the company\u2019s plans for the next two decades don\u2019t mention any planes of a similar size. But as of 2018 more than 1,500 have been delivered. \u201cWhile some may feel nostalgia for the bars and grand pianos that graced the 747, especially in its early days, economics dictate the shape - and size - of things to come,\u201d says Robert Scott. \u201cThose of us with a place in our hearts for the dear old 747 will have to bid farewell to an aircraft that established standards that seemed impossible only a generation ago.\u201d In the meantime, Sutter\u2019s creation will continue to loom over the world\u2019s airport terminals. And every time Mike Lombardi sees one, he\u2019ll be reminded of the designer whose determination ensured that the 747 took flight. \u201cA couple of years ago I was due to fly out to London from Seattle. Just before I was about to make that trip, Joe Sutter passed away. Joe was like a kindly uncle, he really took me under his wing. I saw that 747 taxiing towards me, and I thought of Joe, and it was a very emotional moment.\u201d Lombardi says those 747s remaining \u2013 increasingly flying freight rather than passengers \u2013 will be in service for many years to come. Future generations will share his own memories as a child, watching a 747 climb into the air and wonder how it stays aloft. \u201cEven when you understand all the science of airplanes, I still think there\u2019s a little bit of magic there too.\u201d -- Join 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0Instagram.

            "text": "Fifty years ago, Boeing unveiled the 747 for the first time. BBC Future looks at the career of the plane that shrank the world. The Boeing 747 was unveiled to a crowd of thousands on 30 September 1968, at the new Everett factory near Seattle, constructed especially to build the new plane. The age of the \u2018jumbo jet\u2019 had begun. The new jet was designed to fly long-haul flights, such as New York to London, with twice as many passengers as Boeing\u2019s pioneering 707. The plane would end up having a maximum take-off weight of more than 333 tonnes. To lift such a massive weight into the air, the plane 37,000lbs (16.8 tonnes) of thrust. The 747 was significantly larger than any other airliner yet built. It measured more than 210ft long (63.6m) and had a wingspan of 195ft (59m). And airlines often had to work out where to store it \u2013 the top of the rudder towered six storeys above the ground. Airlines queued up to buy the giant airliner, which allowed them to fly up to 4,620 miles (8,560km) without refuelling. More than any other aircraft, the 747 pioneered long-haul flying. The success was to Boeing\u2019s immense relief \u2013 it had racked up debts of more than $1bn, much of it thanks to the 747 project, and had to seek funding from seven different banks. British Airways ended up becoming the biggest customer of the 747 over the years, flying 101 of various models in its fleet. In 2018, BA remains the biggest current operator of the 747, flying 36 of the -400 model on long-haul routes. How many passengers can be fitted on a 747 is up to the airlines themselves \u2013 most have a multi-class layout with extra space for first and business-class travellers. With such a layout a 747-400 can carry around 416 passengers, but the absolute record for a 747 was in an operation carried out by the Israeli Air Force to airlift Ethiopian Jews in the early 1990s. One El-Al 747 took off with 1,122 people \u2013 and landed safely back in Israel. The 747 has become synonymous with long-haul travel and a huge success both as an airliner and a freighter \u2013 more than 1,500 have been built since 1968. Fifty years after its unveiling, some 545 continue to fly, many of them freight aircraft converted from retired airliners. \u00a0 An especially strengthened and modified 747 was built to carry Nasa\u2019s Space Shuttle. The space vehicle was placed on top of the fuselage at its landing base and then flown to the launch site at Cape Canaveral. The Shuttle Carrier Aircraft remained in service until 2012, carrying out a last scenic flight with the Shuttle on board before delivering the spaceplane to a museum in Los Angeles. The advent of more powerful engines has let aircraft designers create twin-engined long-haul aircraft, like Boeing\u2019s 777 and 787 and the Airbus A350. These can\u2019t carry as many people as the 747 or its rival the Airbus A380 but are cheaper to fly. This has meant many 747s have been withdrawn from passenger-carrying duty and converted to freighters. Joe Sutter\u2019s original design incorporated a nose door to allow freight to be driven into the plane. Boeing 747s are thought to have flown 3.5bn passengers over the course of their lives \u2013 almost half of the current world population. Boeing says it expects freight-carrying models to keep flying for at least another 20 years.",

            "title": "X-37B: Secrets of the US military spaceplane",
            "text": "As the US Air Force prepares for the third launch of its mysterious X-37B vehicle, BBC Future looks at what is known about the classified project. In the early morning of 16 June, 2012, a top secret spaceplane made a picture perfect landing at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. To those unfamiliar with the vehicle, it might have looked roughly similar to the US space shuttle, the manned spacecraft that shuttled astronauts into space for three decades. But this spaceplane, called the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle, is very different. While it looks like a plane, is launched on a rocket, has a cargo bay and uses some of the same technology as the shuttle, such as thermal shielding to protect it during reentry, it is smaller and unmanned. It is designed to stay in orbit for months on end and can automatically land back on Earth. Perhaps more crucially, the Boeing-designed plane is operated by the US Air Force and its mission is a closely held secret, prompting a slew of speculation about its true purpose. Since the first X-37B was launched in 2010, amateur satellite spotters have carefully followed the robotic spacecraft\u2019s orbit, while those unconnected with the program have speculated that the plane could be anything from an anti-satellite weapon to so-called \u201con demand reconnaissance,\u201d shorthand for a spy satellite that can be placed over any country in the world. Compounding the mystery was the launch of a second vehicle in 2011, which stayed in orbit for 469 days, long exceeding the Air Force\u2019s stated maximum requirement of 270 days for the spaceplane. Now, a third launch is slated for 11 December, according to an Air Force spokesperson, once again ramping up the rumour mill. So, what do we actually know about the plane? Tactical response Early reports focused on the X-37B\u2019s seeming resemblance, at least in size and weight, to the X-20 Dynasoar (short for Dynamic Soarer), a 1950s-era hypersonic vehicle that was envisioned for a variety of military missions, including bombing and sabotaging enemy satellites. However, experts familiar with the X-37B programme emphasized that its technology is actually closer to the recently retired space shuttle (a fact reinforced by Boeings\u2019 proposal for a crewed version of the vehicle known as the X-37C). The Air Force blandly described the role of the X-37B in a factsheet given to media as a \"reliable, reusable, unmanned space test platform\u201d. The Air Force also says the mini-shuttle has two objectives: testing \u201creusable spacecraft technologies\u201d and conducting \u201cexperiments which can be returned to, and examined, on Earth\u201d. Again, this is similar to the stated aims of the space shuttle. But many forget that earlier craft also had a secret military role. Although ostensibly a civilian program, it conducted a series of missions from 1982-1992 on behalf of the National Reconnaissance Office, carrying a series of classified spy satellites. Similarly, most outside experts now agree that it\u2019s likely the robotic space plane is being used for some sort of secret reconnaissance. \u201cI think the guess that makes most sense is quick-response tactical imaging, meaning hours to a couple of days from request to delivery,\u201d says Allen Thomson, a former CIA analyst. Thomson says it is also possible that it could have a more mundane but useful task, such as \u201cmaintaining up-to-date general purpose mapping imagery.\u201d However, if that is the case, Thomson says that it could be a waste of money. \u201cI think that the commercial satellites could and should do that cheaper and better than X-37B,\u201d he says. It is a view backed by parts of the scientific community. Indeed, the X-37B launches comes in the middle of a larger debate about the role of government-operated spy satellites, which have proven enormously costly but can provide some of the most advanced imagery, versus commercial satellite imagery. The US intelligence community recently slashed its budget for commercial imagery, indicating that it was going back to greater reliance on its own classified satellites. The view that the X-37B is a reconnaissance platform is strengthened by observations from amateur satellite watchers, who track the vehicles\u2019 orbits, and noticed that it has similar orbits to spy satellites and scientific remote sensing craft. In addition, they noticed the craft changing its orbital path several times during its test flights. This is to be expected, says Joan Johnson-Freese, professor of national security studies at the US Naval War College in Newport. \u201cThe upcoming launch will continue just to see what the vehicle can do,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of the things they are testing is maneuverability. The problem with satellites in orbit is they are very predictably in certain orbits at certain times, and thus vulnerable to anti-satellite weapons (ASAT).\u201d Johnson-Freese says the military has long been interested in the ability of a spacecraft that has \u201cthe ability to evade, to maneuver, to not be in a predicable place at a predicable time.\u201d She expects the Air Force will be \u201cpressing the envelope for manoeuvrability and duration\u201d during the X-37B\u2019s next flight. \u201cThat will give them the idea of potential missions where avoidance of ASATs comes into play.\u201d \u2018No weapons\u2019 Although its orbits may be difficult to predict in advance, its tracks show where the X-37B has been and its likely purpose, says Brian Weeden, a technical advisor at the Secure World Foundation, a Washington-based foundation that focuses on space issues. For example, he says, the X-37B flew at inclination of 42.79 degrees, which tells you how far north and south in latitude the spacecraft can see. \u201cThe tradeoff is that something at a 90 degree polar orbit covers the whole world, but its frequency is less; it may arrive only every couple of days,\u201d he says. \u201cIf something is 40 or 45 degrees, it would be covering a smaller portion [of the earth], but more often. \u201c At a 42.79 degree inclination, the X-37B would be useful for looking at a geographic region such as the Middle East, says Weeden, pouring cold water on one theory that that it was used to spy on China\u2019s spacelab, Tiangong-1. And given the current political context, he says, the Middle East \u201cmakes sense\u201d. Weeden also suggests the X-37B\u2019s orbit may indicate that the military is trying out a new sensor system, such as radar imaging or hyperspectral sensors, which collect information across different wavelengths. He suggests this could be the case, because unlike satellites collecting light in the visible wavelength, the X-37B\u2019s orbits are not synchronized with the sun, a trick used to maintain a predictable angle between the sun, satellite and ground. But, like with many of the theories surrounding the X-37B, he warns, \u201cit is just speculation.\u201d For its part, the Air Force itself is silent about the plane\u2019s use, only speaking to allay fears that it was a weapon. \"I don't know how this could be called weaponisation of space. It's just an updated version of the space shuttle type of activities in space,\" said Gary Payton, the Air Force's deputy undersecretary for space programmes, in 2010.\u00a0 \"We, the Air Force, have a suite of military missions in space and this new vehicle could potentially help us do those missions better.\" Whatever its purpose; the X-37B is perhaps one of the few bright spots among the Pentagon\u2019s hypersonic test vehicle programs.\u00a0 The Air Force\u2019s X-51A Waverider, a scramjet powered hypersonic missile, suffered a fatal mishap earlier this year on a test flight, and never reached hypersonic speeds.\u00a0 Separately, another hypersonic prototype, known as the Falcon Hypersonic Test Vehicle-2, suffered mishaps in both flight tests, plunging into the ocean. Those other efforts, which are focused on creating missiles, are still in early testing phase, while the X-37B is clearly further along. \u201cI think the one interesting question is whether this is just test and evaluation, or is it being used to be support real world operations,\u201d says Weeden. But like most questions about the plane, it is one that is currently impossible to answer. If you would like to comment on this story, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",

            "text": "A surprisingly simple bug afflicts computers controlling planes, spacecraft and more \u2013 they get confused by big numbers. As Chris Baraniuk discovers, the glitch has led to explosions, missing space probes and more. Tuesday, 4 June 1996 will forever be remembered as a dark day for the European Space Agency (Esa). The first flight of the crewless Ariane 5 rocket, carrying with it four very expensive scientific satellites, ended after 39 seconds in an unholy ball of smoke and fire. It\u2019s estimated that the explosion resulted in a loss of $370m (\u00a3240m). What happened? It wasn\u2019t a mechanical failure or an act of sabotage. No, the launch ended in disaster thanks to a simple software bug. A computer getting its maths wrong \u2013 essentially getting overwhelmed by a number bigger than it expected. How is it possible that computers get befuddled by numbers in this way? It turns out such errors are answerable for a series of disasters and mishaps in recent years, destroying rockets, making space probes go missing, and sending missiles off-target. So what are these bugs, and why do they happen? Imagine trying to represent a value of, say, 105,350 miles on an odometer that has a maximum value of 99,999. The counter would \u201croll over\u201d to 00,000 and then count up to 5,350, the remaining value. This is the same species of inaccuracy that doomed the 1996 Ariane 5 launch. More technically, it\u2019s called \u201cinteger overflow\u201d, essentially meaning that numbers are too big to be stored in a computer system, and sometimes this can cause malfunction. Failure to launch A full investigation of the Ariane incident found that a process left over from software in the previous generation of rockets, Ariane 4, had captured an unexpectedly high reading for the sideways velocity of the newer, faster vehicle \u2013 and the Ariane 5 rocket\u2019s software couldn\u2019t handle this high figure. A self-destruct sequence was initiated. A couple of seconds later, the rocket was history, as the video below shows.  Such glitches emerge with surprising frequency. It\u2019s suspected that the reason why Nasa lost contact with the Deep Impact space probe in 2013 was an integer limit being reached. And just last week it was reported that Boeing 787 aircraft may suffer from a similar issue. The control unit managing the delivery of power to the plane\u2019s engines will automatically enter a failsafe mode \u2013 and shut down the engines \u2013 if it has been left on for over 248 days. Hypothetically, the engines could suddenly halt even in mid-flight. The Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s directive on the matter states that a counter in the control unit\u2019s software will \u201coverflow\u201d after this specific period of time, causing an error. Although scant details have been released \u2013 the FAA and Boeing declined to comment for this article \u2013 some amateur observers have pointed out that 248 days (when counted in 100ths of a second) is equal to the number 2,147,483,647 \u2013 which is significant. How so? It just so happens that 2,147,483,647 is the maximum positive value that can be stored by a \u201c32-bit signed register\u201d, commonly installed on many computer systems. On Ariane, by comparison, the software was using a \"16-bit\" space, which is much smaller and only capable of storing a maximum value of 32,767.    Puzzling limitNumbers are infinite, so why choose such limited storage spaces for them? The answer is that computers have traditionally demanded efficiency in all things. Storage space used to be much more costly than it is today and processing larger values took longer. If you kept to certain limits, software was expected to run more smoothly. Rocket guidance systems do a lot of critical number crunching very quickly, so these overheads certainly matter. The problem with that, as the Ariane 5 proved, is that such limitations aren\u2019t always foreseen as problematic.\u201cWe have to recognise that in software we are always approximating reality,\u201d explains Bill Scherlis, a software expert at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cThere\u2019s always an engineering trade-off between the cost of having a more precise representation and the benefit of the efficiency.\u201d Numbers are infinite, so why choose such limited storage spaces for them?

Arnold also notes the 1991 case of a Patriot missile which failed to intercept an Iraqi Scud attack on a US Army barracks during the Gulf War. In this case, an overflow error meant that the missile defence system mis-tracked the incoming Scud projectile, which was travelling at 1.7km/s, and instead scanned an area of airspace more than 500 metres from the target. As a result, the Scud hit the barracks, killed 28 soldiers and injured a further 98 people. The full details of the computer bug in this case are quite complicated, but software engineer Andrew Lum at the University of Sydney has posted a helpful explanation of what happened, including diagrams of the Patriot system. Gangnam glitch Not all rollover glitches are as destructive as these examples, but they do frequently create unexpected effects. For example, in the video game Civilization, an unanticipated bug in this vein caused the peaceful character Gandhi to become uncharacteristically hostile. When players chose a certain mode to play in, the value which defined Gandhi\u2019s aggressiveness rolled backwards past zero to the maximum. Consequently, he would threaten players with nuclear weapons at every turn \u2013 to the great amusement of many players. And in December, it was reported that Gangnam Style, the most popular video of all time on YouTube had \u201cbroken\u201d the website\u2019s view counter. The counter had apparently been programmed to only run to 2,147,483,647 \u2013 again, the maximum positive value of a 32-bit signed register. It turned into good PR for YouTube, which updated the view count storage while wallowing in worldwide coverage of the site\u2019s most popular ever video. The new maximum is well over nine quintillion. Scherlis notes that the previous limitation reveals the expectations of the original programmers who built YouTube. \u201cCertainly, when YouTube\u2019s software was first developed I think it was probably hard for any developers or designers to imagine that they would overflow [this number],\u201d he says. It\u2019s often this sort of assumption, which initially may seem reasonable, that causes problems years down the line. The most talked about overflow bug in history, which many will remember, was the much-hyped Millennium Bug. Although largely considered a damp squib, the Y2K problem did cause some headaches. Twelve years later, in a similar incident, a 105 year-old woman in Sweden named Anna Eriksson received a letter inviting her to start pre-school because software had been designed to contact individuals born in \u201c07\u201d. The designers intended this for people with a birthdate in 2007, not 1907 as was the case for Ms Eriksson. An inability to correctly recognise the year even led to millions of German credit and debit cards becoming unusable on New Year\u2019s Day in 2010. The year 2038 About 15 years ago programmer William Porquet had the idea of thinking ahead to yet another crucial date \u2013 GMT 3.14.07am on Tuesday 19 January 2038. This is the moment when the number of seconds since 1 January 1970 will exceed one of the maximum values of many computers\u2019 date and time registers nowadays. Like the Millennium Bug, failure to prepare for this could result in computer crashes. \u201cIt was in 1999 that I first wrote about this,\u201d comments Porquet. \u201cI acquired the domain name 2038.org and at first it was very tongue-in-cheek. It was almost a piece of satire, a kind of an in-joke with a lot of computer boffins who say, \u2018oh yes we\u2019ll fix that in 2037\u2026\u2019 But then I realised there are actually some issues with this.\u201d Porquet is concerned about old bits of software that nobody tends to anymore \u2013 on long-established networks, or on old hardware being used in remote parts of the world. How many of them will still be in use 23 years from now and what consequences that could have is anybody\u2019s guess. \u201cA lot of computer systems,\u201d notes Porquet, \u201ccan be caused to fail in a predictable manner. But this is failure in an unpredictable manner.\u201d Glitch in time Markus Kuhn, a computer scientist at the University of Cambridge explains that time related bugs create interest partly because their consequences are unpredictable, but also because they are \u201cnot unexpected\u201d and that people are able to speculate about what will happen when the fateful date arrives. Kuhn thinks that the 2038 problem will be less significant than Y2K because the Millennium Bug has prepared the computer industry to make the necessary fixes. Indeed, that\u2019s all part of William Porquet\u2019s plan. \u201cI hope it\u2019s something that will take me out of semi-retirement for a very large sum of money,\u201d he says, only half joking. For Kuhn, the interesting time problem for computers of the moment is not an overflow glitch per se, but it is one this coming June. The year 2015 will be a second longer than 2014 thanks to a move to correct the discrepancy between astronomical time (the time on Earth based on our planet\u2019s rotation) and atomic time (the most accurate known time-keeping method, in terms of counting seconds). While atomic time, which is to be adjusted with this year\u2019s leap second, is mind-bogglingly precise, it is actually slightly out of sync with astronomical time because the Earth\u2019s rotation is very gradually decelerating. Geological events such as earthquakes can cause changes in the speed of this rotation meaning that the addition of leap seconds, unlike leap years, is variable. The last one was in 2012 and\u00a0crashed many computers. Fortunately, says Kuhn, we\u2019ll hopefully be more prepared than we were in the past. It seems like no matter what we do, certain numbers and calculations will always confuse computers, causing malfunction \u2013 or worse. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot from the Y2K experience and other similar events,\u201d notes Scherlis. \u201cBut the reality in which we are always making approximations and having to navigate an engineering trade off? That is with us forever.\u201d Share this story on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0Google+\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter.",

            "text": "The Airbus A380 is the world\u2019s biggest airliner. Jack Stewart gets a behind-the-scenes look at some of its secrets. The Airbus A380 is the largest passenger plane in operation, and is still an awe-inspiring sight nearly a decade after it first entered regular service. Stand at the end of the runway at one of the large airports that it operates out of, and you will hear people exclaim \u201chow does something that big get into the air?!\u201d Often the next comment is: \u201cHow do they get all the people on and off?\u201d Because that\u2019s the other thing about this giant of the skies; as we\u2019ll find out it can fit hundreds of people, their luggage, and the comforts and entertainment they demand on its long flight routes. British Airways has ordered 12 A380s for its fleet (some of which are still being built), and invited BBC Future to witness an engineering service inspection \u2013 known as a 2A check \u2013 to see the parts of the plane that the paying public do not usually get to see, and to discover the answers to some of the most common questions. First things first; the A380 is so large that the engineering hangars at Heathrow Airport had to be specially modified \u2013 and these hangars can easily swallow a Boeing 747. The 1950s buildings are architectural landmarks, but at 23m (76ft) high were just a shade too short to fit the plane\u2019s giant tail fin. The entrance to two hangars was given an extra notch in height of 3.5m (11.5ft) to allow the A380 tail to pass through. It is still a tight fit, as you can see in our timelapse: \u00a0 Derek Cogswell, an aircraft engineer for British Airways, was our guide through the engineering maintenance facilities. \u201cIt took about 18 months to convert these two hangars to be able to accept the A380,\u201d he says. The aircraft we are touring is in for a service check, which occurs every three months. \u201cAs a passenger you only ever see these engines closed up,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to open them up now so that you can see the complexity of these amazing machines.\u201d The A380 is available with a choice of jet engines. The configuration BA uses is four Rolls-Royce Trent 900 turbofans. Unusually the A380 does without thrust reversers on the outermost engines, which are normally used to slow down an aircraft on landing. The giant brake packs on each of the A380\u2019s wheels were designed to produce all the braking power needed. You can see them here: There are thrust reverse systems on the inboard engines (the ones closest to the fuselage on each wing) to assist when the tyres don\u2019t have enough grip, such as on a wet runway. The engine cowlings are so large they cannot be opened by hand, so they have to use electrical power. Several clamps are released by hand, and then it\u2019s just a case of pushing an \u201cUP\u201d switch and letting the motors whine and do their work. BBC Future was allowed to open the cowling, but as Cogswell explained safety is always upmost. \u201cThat\u2019s my responsibility,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll be there to make sure it\u2019s all closed properly and safe for flight.\u201d Onboard the plane, there are areas that might look familiar to the frequent flyer, but there are a number of other areas that passengers never get to see. Divided across the two decks which run the full length of the aircraft there are seats for 469 passengers in the configuration that British Airways uses. If all the seats were economy though, Airbus believes 853 people could fit on board. That\u2019s half the number of passengers on the QE2, if you\u2019re counting. In between two of the cabins on the lower deck there is a small door in the bulkhead, with a combination lock. As Cogswell says, \u201cthere is a whole new world down here\u201d. There are 12 bunks for the crew to take rest breaks on long flights, and the pilots have their own beds too. Check out where they\u2019re hidden in the video here: A modern aircraft like the A380 requires a vast number of avionics, computer systems that enable the aircraft to keep flying \u2013 it\u2019s the computers making all those minor adjustments that help maintain a comfortable flight. The cockpit is designed to be familiar to pilots, but also to embrace new technology and ways to interact with it. Linking all these systems together is a network of cables and banks of equipment that might look more familiar to a mainframe computer engineer than a flight technician. They look after everything from the radar to the air conditioning to the computers maintaining flight controls. The computers that control those systems, and the network of cables that distribute the commands, live in another hidden area of the aircraft. They\u2019re so important to the plane that they have their own area, accessible via a hidden trapdoor and ladder. BBC Future got to climb through the cables into the tight space to see them: Working on the A380 has presented some unique challenges to engineers such as Cogswell. \u201cI think it\u2019s size more than anything,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything is big, everything is heavy, everything is high up. If you go to the top of the tail\u2026 it\u2019s a long way down!\u201d Bear all of this in mind, next time you\u2019re travelling in one of Airbus\u2019s behemoths\u2026 Share on Facebook, Google+ or Twitter.",

            "text": "Aviation is one of the fastest rising sources of carbon emissions from transport, but can a small Canadian airline show the industry a way of flying that is better for the planet? As air journeys go, it was just a short hop into the early morning sky before the de Havilland seaplane splashed back down on the Fraser River in Richmond, British Columbia. Four minutes earlier it had taken off from the same patch of water. But despite its brief duration, the flight may have marked the start of an aviation revolution. Those keen of hearing at the riverside on that cold December morning might have been able to pick up something different amid the rumble of the propellers and whoosh of water as the six-passenger de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver took off and landed. What was missing was the throaty growl of the aircraft\u2019s nine-cylinder radial engine. You might also like: \u2022 Norway\u2019s plan for a fleet of electric planes  \u2022 The quest to make a material harder than diamonds   \u2022 How does Future Planet count carbon?  In its place was an all-electric propulsion engine built by the technology firm magniX that had been installed in the aircraft over the course of several months. The four-minute test flight (the plane was restricted to flying in clear skies, so with fog and rain closing in the team opted for a short trip) was the first time an all-electric commercial passenger aircraft had taken to the skies. \u201cIt was the first shot of the electric aviation revolution,\u201d says Roei Ganzarski, chief executive of magniX, which worked with Canadian airline Harbour Air Seaplanes to convert one of the aircraft in their fleet of seaplanes so it could run on battery power rather than fossil fuels. For Greg McDougall, founder of Harbour Air and pilot during the test flight, it marked the culmination of years of trying to put the environment at the forefront of its operations. Harbour Air, which has a fleet of some 40 commuter floatplanes serving the coastal regions around Vancouver, Victoria and Seattle, was the first airline in North America to become carbon-neutral through offsets in 2007. A one-acre green roof on their new Victoria airline terminal followed. Then in 2017, 50 solar panels and four beehives housing 10,000 honeybees were added, but for McDougall, a Tesla owner with an interest in disruptive technology, the big goal was to electrify the fleet. McDougall searched for alternative motor options for a couple of years and had put the plan on the backburner when Ganzarski first approached him in February 2019. \u201cHe said, \u2018We\u2019ve got a motor we want to get certified and we want to fly it before the end of the year,\u2019\u201d McDougall recalls. The two companies found their environmental values and teams were a good match and quickly formed a partnership. Eleven months later, the modest Canadian airline got what McDougall refers to as their \u201ce-plane\u201d off the ground, pulling ahead of other electric flight projects, including those by big-name companies Airbus, Boeing and Rolls-Royce. The project came together in record time considering how risk-adverse the aviation industry is, says McDougall. \u201cSomeone had to take the lead,\u201d he says. \u201cThe reason I live in British Columbia is because of the outdoors: protecting it is in our DNA. When it came to getting the benefits from electric flight it made sense for us to step in and pioneer the next step.\u201d Electric flight has been around since the 1970s, but it\u2019s remained limited to light-weight experimental planes flying short distances and solar-powered aircraft with enormous wingspans yet incapable of carrying passengers. But as the threat posed by the climate crisis deepens, there has been renewed interest in developing electric passenger aircraft as a way of reducing emissions and airline operating costs. Currently there are about 170 electric aircraft projects underway internationally \u2013up by 50% since April 2018, according to the consulting firm Roland Berger. Many of the projects are futuristic designs aimed at developing urban air taxis, private planes or aircraft for package delivery. But major firms such as Airbus have also announced plans to electrify their own aircraft. It plans to send its E-Fan X hybrid prototype of a commercial passenger jet on its maiden flight by 2021. But only one of the aircraft\u2019s four jet engines will be replaced with a 2MW electric motor, powered by a combination of an onboard battery and generator attached to a turboshaft engine, which still uses fossil fuels, inside the fuselage. This makes Harbour Air something of an outlier. As a coastal commuter airline, it operates smaller floatplanes that tend to make short trips up and down the coastline of British Columbia and Washington State, which means its aircraft can regularly recharge their batteries. The company sees itself in a position to retrofit its entire fleet of floatplanes and make air travel in the region as green as possible. This could bring some advantages. The efficiency of a typical combustion engine for a plane like this is fairly low \u2013 a large proportion of the energy from the fuel is lost as waste heat as it turns the propeller that drives the aircraft forward. Electrical motors have fewer moving parts, meaning there\u2019s less maintenance and less maintenance cost. Erika Holtz, Harbour Air\u2019s engineering and quality manager, sees the move to electric as the next major aviation advancement, but warns that one stumbling block has been the perception of safety. \u201cMechanical systems are much better known and trusted,\u201d she says. In contrast people see electrical systems as a bit unknown \u2013 think of your home computer. \u201cTurning it off and on again isn\u2019t an option in aviation,\u201d she adds. But it\u2019s the possibility of spurring lasting change in aviation that\u2019s made working on the Harbour Air/magniX project so exciting for Holtz. Aviation technology has stagnated over the past decades, she says. \u201cAlthough there have been incremental improvements in certain technologies, there hasn't been a major development change in aviation in 50 years.\u201d One area that requires further development is battery capacity. Many experts doubt that large fully electric passenger airliners will be available any time soon \u2013 current battery technology simply does not offer as many miles per kilo compared to aviation fuel.\u00a0 The power density in aviation fuel is high, in the neighbourhood of 12,000 watt hours per kilogram. A lithium ion battery is only in the region of 200 watt hours per kilogram.  Harbour Air\u2019s short-distance flights on small, single and twin engine planes have lower power demands which mean they don\u2019t need heavy batteries. \u201cMost of our routes are within the range of technology that exists today,\u201d McDougall says. This ability to use existing technology, including the 62-year-old Beaver airframe and the Nasa-certified lithium ion batteries, means the certification process to meet the Federal Aviation Agency and Transport Canada requirements is expected to be easier than it would be with a plane built from the ground up. Harbour Air hopes to get paying passengers in its eplanes in under two years. \u201cCanada isn't always known as an innovation centre,\u201d says Holtz. \u201cIt's very regulated and aviation itself is very regulated. But Transport Canada has been trying to help us get through hurdles instead of putting them up.\u201d But Harbour Air\u2019s efforts to electrify their fleet are unlikely to have a major impact on aviation emissions. \u201cTwo to 12 passenger aircraft are only a tiny fraction of global aviation emissions,\u201d says Lynnette Dray, senior research associate at University College London\u2019s Energy Institute. \u201cEven looking at all scheduled flights under 500 miles (which are performed by many sizes of aircraft, most of which are much bigger than two to 12 seats), less than 10% of global scheduled passenger fuel use and CO2 emissions can be substituted.\u201d Where Dray sees the Canadian airline having a bigger impact is with public perception. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of value in getting prototype models to market so that the technology has a chance to become familiar and trusted,\u201d she says. Blazing a trail for other electrical aircraft projects has been a major goal for Harbour Air and magniX. According to the The International Council on Clean Transportation, aviation contributes an estimated 2.4% of global carbon emissions with 24% of global passenger transport-related CO2 being attributed to flights originating in the US. This should be a strong motivator for change, says Ganzarski. \u201cI think the idea of electric aviation \u2013 getting rid of emissions and lowering operating costs \u2013 is something that the worldwide community should embrace,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more companies get into it, the better. But we\u2019ll be there right in front, leading the way.\u201d The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 5kg CO2, travelling by bus, train and car. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view.

            "text": "A record-breaking commercial-scale hydrogen plane has taken off in the UK, with more set to join it soon. How far can such planes go in cutting the aviation industry's emissions? As the plane rose from the runway for what was to prove a smooth and uneventful flight, the team breathed a sigh of relief. The six-seater Piper M-Class had been fitted out at a research and development hub at Cranfield airport in the UK to run on hydrogen, and on this maiden flight in the late summer of 2020 everything worked perfectly.\u00a0With that flight, ZeroAvia, the California-based start-up that had developed the aircraft with partners in Britain and elsewhere, was ready to move to the next stage in the journey towards zero carbon aviation. A catchphrase for the transition to a low or zero carbon economy is \"electrify everything\" \u2013 that is, create a world in which most human activities, from manufacturing and construction to transport and tourism, run on electricity generated from low or zero carbon sources such as wind, solar and perhaps nuclear power.\u00a0But there is a problem: some sectors look to be hard if not impossible to electrify in the near and medium term, and aviation is, perhaps, foremost among them.\u00a0 Before the pandemic grounded most flights, commercial aviation accounted for about 2.5% of global emissions of carbon dioxide. It sounds like a small proportion of the whole, but it is more than those of Germany (2.2%), and\u00a0this is not the whole story. Carbon dioxide accounts for about half of aviation's contribution to what is known as its effective radiative forcing \u2013 that is, its total contribution to the factors that actually drive a rise in global average temperature. Contrails \u2013 water vapour trails from aircraft \u2013 are aviation's largest other factor. The good news is that commercial aviation has an excellent track record in improving efficiency. Carbon dioxide emissions per passenger flight have fallen more than 50% since 1990 thanks to improved engines and operations. The bad news is that these gains have been overwhelmed by rising volumes of air traffic. This has increased by at least a fifth over the past five years, and is predicted to reach 10 billion passengers a year by 2050. At first glance, hydrogen\u00a0looks to be a good solution to the challenge of flying without wrecking the climate.\u00a0Whether hydrogen is used to power a fuel cell to generate electricity or directly combusted for motive power, the only waste product is clean water. Importantly in the context of flight, hydrogen packs a lot of energy per unit of mass \u2013 three times more than conventional jet fuel, and more than a hundred times that of lithium-ion batteries.\u00a0 Governments and companies are investing in this potential. ZeroAvia's 2020 hydrogen-powered flight, known as HyFlyer I, was supported by the UK Government, whose Jet Zero Council promises \"a laser focus on UK production facilities for sustainable aviation fuels and the acceleration of the design, manufacture and commercial operation of zero-emission aircraft.\" The UK government, together with private investors and commercial partners are supporting ZeroAvia in the development of an aircraft with a hydrogen-electric (fuel cell) powertrain capable of carrying up to 20 passengers about 350 nautical miles (648km).\u00a0ZeroAvia's founder and chief executive Val Miftakhov, says the company expects to offer commercial flights using such a plane as early as 2023, and that by 2026 it will be able to realise flights over a range of 500 nautical miles (926km) in aircraft with up to 80 seats. For 2030, Miftakhov has even bigger plans: \"We will have single-aisle jets, 100-seat category,\" he says. There is ambition in mainland Europe too. Hydrogen \"is one of the most promising technology vectors to allow mobility to continue fulfilling the basic human need for mobility in better harmony with our environment\", says Grazia Vitaldini, chief technology officer at Airbus, the world's largest aircraft manufacturer. In September 2020, Airbus announced that hydrogen-fuelled propulsion systems would be at the heart of a new generation of zero-emissions commercial aircraft. The project, named ZeroE, is a flagship of the European Union's multibillion-euro stimulus package, aimed at greening the bloc's economy.\u00a0 Airbus has presented three concept planes which it says could be ready for deployment by 2035. The first is a turboprop (propeller) driven aircraft capable of carrying around 100 passengers about 1,000 nautical miles (1,850km). The second, a turbofan (jet), could carry 200 passengers twice as far. Both look similar to already existing planes, but ZeroE's third concept is a futuristic-looking blended-wing design that is a striking departure from commercial models today. Airbus says this third design could be capable of carrying more passengers over longer distances than the other two, but has not released more detail at this stage. All three designs are envisaged as hydrogen hybrids, which means they would be powered by gas-turbine engines that burn liquid hydrogen as fuel, and also generate electricity via hydrogen fuel cells. The work at ZeroAvia and Airbus has aroused a lot of interest, but not everyone in the aviation industry is convinced hydrogen will play a major role in a transition towards low or zero carbon flight. The disadvantages start with the physics and chemistry. Hydrogen has higher energy by mass than jet fuel, but it has lower energy by volume. This lower energy density is because it is a gas at typical atmospheric pressure and temperature. The gas needs to be compressed or turned into a liquid by cooling it to extremely low temperatures (-253C) if it is to be stored in sufficient quantities. \"Storage tanks for the compressed gas or liquid are complex and heavy,\" says Finlay Asher, a former aircraft engine designer at Rolls-Royce and founder of Green Sky Thinking, a platform exploring sustainable aviation. And there are other challenges. The energy density of liquid hydrogen is only about a quarter of that of jet fuel. This means that for the same amount of energy it needs a storage tank four times the size. As a consequence, aircraft may either have to carry fewer passengers to make space for the storage tanks, or become significantly larger. The first option, which applies to Airbus's first two concept planes, would mean a reduction in ticket revenue, other things being equal. The second option, embodied in Airbus's third concept, requires a bigger airframe, which is subject to more drag. Further, an entire new infrastructure would need to be put in place to transport and store hydrogen at airports. In addition, there is the question of whether hydrogen can be produced at scale and at a competitive price without itself having a large carbon footprint. The great majority of hydrogen used in industry today is created using fossil fuel methane, releasing carbon dioxide as a waste product.\u00a0Hydrogen can be produced from water through a process called electrolysis, driven by renewable power, but this process is currently expensive and requires large amounts of energy. Only about 1% of hydrogen is produced this way at present. As things stand, liquid hydrogen is more than four times as expensive as conventional jet fuel. Over the coming decades the price is expected to drop as infrastructure is scaled up and becomes more efficient. But according to Britain's Royal Society and the management consulting group McKinsey, it is likely to remain at least twice as expensive as fossil fuels for the next few decades.\u00a0 These factors, and others, give pause for some major players in aviation. Sean Newsum, director of environmental strategy at Boeing Commercial, Airbus's main rival, recently told the Financial Times: \"Our belief is that it will take a while for all the technology and elements of hydrogen propulsion to be worked out before we can get to\u2026 commercial use.\" And a key advisory body to the UK government also has doubts. \"Switching to direct hydrogen adds decades into the transition,\" says David Joffe, of the Climate Change Committee, an advisory body to the UK government. So what are the alternatives? In September 2020, the Air Transport Action Group, a Geneva-based body that speaks on behalf the global aviation industry, published a set of scenarios which suggest that, even as the volume of air traffic increases, it will be possible for global aviation to reach zero emissions of carbon dioxide \u2013 but only a decade or so later than 2050. According to these scenarios, the direct use of hydrogen will play only a marginal role, but the game-changer will be what are termed \"sustainable aviation fuels\", or SAFs. This catch-all term covers a range of products, such as biofuels, that result in low net emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants associated with conventional jet fuel. The advocates of SAFs argue they have a number of clear advantages over pure hydrogen. Because they are chemically identical to existing jet fuel, they can in principle be \"dropped in\" to existing systems with little or no redesign, without delay, and without the substantial ancillary investments required for hydrogen-powered airframes and their supporting infrastructure. Paul Stein, chief technology officer at the engine makers Rolls Royce, argues they are the key to a more sustainable future. \"If SAF production can be scaled up \u2013 and aviation needs 500 million tonnes a year by 2050 \u2013 we can make a huge contribution for our planet,\" he says. SAFs can be divided into two categories. The first are\u00a0biofuels made through the chemical or thermal treatment of biomass such as agricultural residues and other wastes. A second category is electro fuels, or \"E fuels\". Through these fuels, which are also known as \"power to liquid\", hydrogen could end up playing a key role in aviation after all. E fuels are made by reacting hydrogen with carbon dioxide to make \"syngas\". This is then converted through what is known as Fischer-Tropsch process into \"e-crude\" \u2013 a crude oil substitute that can be refined to jet fuel and other fuels. If the large amount of energy required at each stage of manufacture is sourced from zero carbon sources, then the whole process can be carbon neutral, with no more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere after the flight than before the fuel was made. Using direct air capture technology developed by the Swiss company Climeworks to source CO2, and hydrogen produced from water with renewable energy, the Oslo-based company Norsk e-Fuel aims to open what may be the world's first E fuel industrial plant Her\u00f8ya, Norway, in 2023, producing 10 million litres of fuel per year for the Norwegian and European markets. The next step in 2026 would be a plant capable of 100 million litres a year. A full-sized plant could provide half the fuel for the top five most frequently serviced flight routes within Norway, cutting their emissions by half, says Karl Hauptmeier, Norsk e-Fuel's managing director. For now, one thing remains almost certain: hydrogen and E fuels are likely to continue to be substantially more expensive than conventional jet fuel for years or decades to come, limiting their role in greening aviation \u2013 unless the other costs of aviation come to be weighed differently. Campaigners such as Leo Murray of the campaign group Possible argue that conventionally-fuelled aviation must be priced to reflect the cost of the damage it causes to the climate. This, he argues, might mean higher ticket prices, but it could also give us aviation that does not cost the Earth. -- The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2.

            "text": "Fighting fires from the air requires pilots to fly huge aircraft close to the ground \u2013 what\u2019s it like to be in the cockpit? The summer of 2015 has been a cruel one for the Pacific states of the US. California, for instance, has sweltered in record temperatures, as a crippling drought has entered its fourth consecutive year. It\u2019s a drought that is expected to cost the state some $3bn (\u00a31.9bn) and cause the loss of at least 10,000 jobs. But there are other effects too. Effects far more physical, elemental and frightening. In the past few weeks, hundreds of firefighters have battled blazes in the Jerusalem Valley, in northern California. In states further up the coast, such as Oregon and Washington, more blazes have erupted, fuelled by bone-dry brush and fanned by hot summer winds. The California drought has turned to tinder much of the state\u2019s bush and forest. Nearly half of the 163,000 sq mile state is forested. And when this dry forest catches alight \u2013 either from summer thunderstorm lightning strikes, accident or arson \u2013 the devastation can be immense. It\u2019s something Rick Hatton knows only too well. In the last few weeks, Hatton\u2019s company 10 Tanker has been in the thick of it, fighting fires in California and Washington state. His company uses converted DC-10 jets to douse the forest with fire retardant: a mixture of water and a type of fertiliser that soaks into the wood and makes it less likely to burn. To be effective, the pilots must fly the large aircraft only 200 ft (60m) above the treetops. \u201cThe process is very visual and requires vigilance and skill,\u201d he explains. All over the world during summer, pilots like Hatton must make these spectacularly low flights to help halt the flames, and when the retardant is dumped it can be a spectacular sight \u2013 as the video below shows. What does it take to fight fires from the air? The DC-10s often don\u2019t drop retardant on the fire itself, they douse areas in front of an advancing fire, starving it of fuel and making it easier for ground crews to tackle it. They also don\u2019t work alone. They are supported by fire-fighting teams on the ground, and smaller \u2018spotter\u2019 aircraft which fly ahead of the tankers and direct them. \u201cWe have now flown DC-10 tankers on over 1,600 fire flights on more than 300 fires,\u201d Hatton says. \u00a0\u201cEach flight is a little different, but all use a lead plane which directs our three-person crew as to where and at what concentration the retardant is to be dropped. We can segment the drop [drop it in several loads] or deliver it in one continuous line up to nearly a mile long.\" Hatton says flying the DC-10 so close to the ground \u2013 DC-10s usually fly so low only when they\u2019re approaching an airport \u2013 is not necessarily dangerous; the tankers carry a much lighter fuel load than they would have as airliners, so they\u2019re not as heavy and therefore able to manoeuvre more quickly. But this is anything but a routine activity; in 2007, the company\u2019s first DC-10, Tanker 910, encountered turbulence and dropped some 200ft lower than anticipated. The plane\u2019s wing clipped the top of the trees before the crew could pull the aircraft back to a safe height. Jumbo fire-fighters Hatton says the workload can be intense during a busy fire season. \u201cWe have flown as many as nine times in one day with one crew. The fires that grow to mega status have had as many as 50 of our flights to contain them, but the average is nearer five.\u201d Pilots are restricted to no more than 14 hours on duty, even during the biggest fires, and must have at least two days off every 14 days. Hatton says the DC-10\u2019s ability has changed fire-fighting tactics, leading to a technique called \u2018overkill\u2019 \u2013 hitting small fires as hard as possible before they grow into bigger, more unpredictable conflagrations. \u201cThis tactic, called \u2018first strike\u2019, is being adopted by many agencies to help mitigate what is likely to be a fire-prone future in many geographical regions of the world.\u201d The aircraft\u2019s large capacity makes this possible. \u201cWe developed the DC-10 to bring more quantity of suppressant to the fire in one load than any other tanker currently in use,\u201d Hatton says. \u201cThe DC-10 is a real game changer.\u201d One of Hatton\u2019s DC-10s has flown out to Australia to be used during the fire season there. And the DC-10s are no longer the biggest fire-fighters in service. In 2009, a converted Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet operated by Evergreen International has also been used to fight fires. The giant jet can carry 19,600 gallons of retardant or water\u00a0for 4,000 miles, and is the biggest fire-fighting aircraft in the world. There are plans to convert an even bigger, stretched version of the 747 into a tanker as well. Smothering flames with giant airliners is a big leap forward from aerial fire-fighting\u2019s humble roots. According to the US Forest Service, the first recorded fire-fighting flight was in 1930 using a beer keg filled with water, dropped from a Ford Trimotor plane nicknamed the \u201cTin Goose\u201d. The technique began in earnest in the 1940s. Before then, rural firefighters often had to watch blazes burn through brush and forest from a distance, intervening only when fires approached closer to human settlements. After World War II there was a glut of military aircraft suddenly surplus to peacetime requirements \u2013 and a huge number of demobilised pilots able to fly them. But as the years passed the techniques improved, and the amount of water the planes could shower over fires increased. Old bomber aircraft, such as the four-engined Boeing B-17 or the carrier-based Grumman TBM Avenger used in World War II \u2013 were modified, their internal bays converted to carry water instead of weapons. Water-bombers The development of different techniques to tackle different kinds of fires soon called for different types of aircraft. Smaller blazes can often be put out by helicopters carrying water buckets filled in a nearby lake and suspended on a cable beneath. Some helicopters can carry more than 2,500 gallons of water. And a Canadian-built plane, the Canadair CL-415, performs a similar feat, scooping up water from lakes, and dumping it on fires. The US is not the only place where fire-fighting planes are deployed. Wildfires are also a problem in Canada. More than 34% of the country\u2019s landmass \u2013 some 3.1 million sq km \u2013 is forested. The dry, continental summers can see little rain and temperatures over 40C; ideal conditions to give birth to devastating fires. \u201cShould a lightning storm come through an area with dry conditions, multiple wildfires can start in a very short time that can keep us busy for days or even weeks,\u201d says Ray Horton, of the British Columbia-based Conair, who has been flying on anti-fire operations since 1981. Aircraft are only allowed to fly missions during daylight hours. An average day starts around 9am, with crew undergoing briefings while their aircraft are fuelled and filled with fire-retardant chemicals. Then they wait and wait and wait for news of fires. \u201cAs with most firefighters we tend to go through long periods of boredom punctuated with brief periods of intense activity,\u201d says Dennis Chrystian, another Canadian fire-fighting pilot who flies with Air Spray, based in Alberta. \u201cOur level of preparedness depends on the level of fire hazard and varies from having one hour to get in the air to a state where we are ready for immediate dispatch. The aircraft operated by Air Spray are all retardant-carrying tankers. We do not attack the flame directly as a \u2018bucket brigade\u2019 would, but are trying to fire-proof areas ahead of or along the flanks of a fire.\u201d The retardants used by fire-fighters were once more damaging to the forest: in the early days, sodium calcium borate was mixed with water, but this chemical sterilised the ground. Now they contain fertiliser. \u201cIt is usually coloured red or lately, bright pink, in order for flight crews to see it clearly in the trees and allow for 'tagging on' and extending an existing retardant line,\u201d says Chrystian. \u201cThe colour is designed to fade over time and the fertiliser properties actually promote growth and rejuvenation after a fire is extinguished.\u201d However, in order to protect wildlife and avoid contaminating water, pilots must carefully avoid dumping the retardant near rivers and lakes, or in areas known to have endangered species. When the tankers reach the fires, they follow the directions of the spotting planes. \u201cWe do our best to remain clear of the thick smoke column rising from a fire and thereby avoid most turbulence associated with the fire itself,\u201d says Horton. \u201cHowever, flying low level in the summer months is typically always somewhat turbulent from rising air near the Earth's surface. Another factor that is often the cause of large fires is wind. Strong winds that may fan a fire always provide a challenge for aerial firefighting due to terrain-induced turbulence, wind-driven smoke and the retardant drifting too. This can also make it difficult to control airspeed and altitude.\u201d It can get hairy at times. This year, a fire blew up one around one of the company\u2019s pilots. \u201cIn the few seconds it took to get out of the heat and turbulence two of his engines failed,\u201d he recalls. The tanker managed to limp back to base on its two remaining engines. \u201cThere is some inherent danger in our line of work, however we all work very hard at reducing the risk,\u201d Chrystian continues. \u201cOne of the biggest risks we face is complacency. If it\u2019s your job to fly a 100,000lb tanker down to 150ft above the ground and fly it as slow as possible every day, it\u2019s easy to start to think of that as routine. It is anything but routine.\" Chrystian says the worst fire he has seen was one he fought was at Slave Lake in Alberta in 2011.\u00a0 \u201cRelatively speaking the fire was not large but managed to get into town destroying 30% of the town (nearly 500 structures) and doing over CAN$700m damage. It is considered one of the worst natural disasters in Canadian history. \u201cThe fire was driven by winds that exceeded 100 km/h and we were powerless to stop it. We continued to attempt to stop or slow the fire right up until it got into town. The only positive effect we had on that day may have been keeping the road open so the residents could get out of town. No lives were lost to the fire.\u201d Both pilots stress that their aircraft are just a part of the puzzle when it comes to fighting fires. \u201cIt is the men and women with boots on the ground (with cooperation from nature) that put fires out, we only operate in support of the ground crews, says Chrystian. \u201cWe act to slow or hold fires so that the ground crews can get them under control. The really large fires require rain or winter to be put out.\u201d And they never forget the power of what they are up against. Horton remembers the moment he saw his first fire. \u201cIt\u2019s frightening and awe-inspiring at the same time. It is incredible to see what the power of Mother Nature can do when the right conditions exist.\u201d Chrystian agrees. \u201cThe first time I saw a large fire from the air knowing we were going to attempt fighting it I was totally demoralised. A large fire can make you feel very small.\u201d Follow us on\u00a0Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn",

            "text": "Wingsuits are hugely popular with extreme sports fans \u2013 but are often developed on the fly. One man plans to build the ultimate suit \u2013 and jump out of a plane in it at 45,000ft. Pinned in place, like a moth in a specimen case, a man in a skydiver's wingsuit is taking the full force of the 90mph (135km/h) air blast in the University of Southampton's RJ Mitchell Wind Tunnel. But seasoned skydiver Angelo Niko Grubisic isn\u2019t just having fun: he's leading the first attempt to apply aeronautical engineering principles to the extreme sport of wingsuit skydiving, a field in which, until now, suits were designed with only the vaguest of design laws.\u00a0 A lecturer in spacecraft propulsion and astronautics at Southampton, Grubisic is also an experienced wingsuit Base jumper and skydiver. Now he is combining those interests and, alongside 10 aeronautics students, is using the university's aviation analytics and test kit to design a new type of ultra-aerodynamic wingsuit. The aim is to make a suit with reduced drag that will fly for longer \u2013 letting the Southampton team set new human flight records for wingsuits, breaking current records for launch altitude, the maximum speed achieved, distance flown and the duration of the wingsuit flight. And it might lead to more than just bragging rights, too: the new suit could help save lives.\u00a0In an increasingly dangerous branch of the sport called wingsuit proximity flying - a form of Base jumping - people leap from cliffs, rather than planes, and fly just tens of feet above mountain slopes and treelines, sometimes even passing through slim gullies and holes in the rock. A wingsuit that keeps you in the air longer could make all the difference. Some experts say better suits will only lead to more forms of risk taking, however. Grubisic's team are planning to test the students suit from the air. \"We are very risk averse and methodical,\" he says. Called Project Icarus, their record-attempt programme involves capturing the three-dimensional geometry of wingsuits in flight. This is being done by making a special chest rig \u2013 like a piece of roman chest armour \u2013 that, as its name suggests, is strapped to the flyer\u2019s chest. The wingsuit pilot is then hung from the ceiling of the wind tunnel by posts that bolt on to the chest rig. When pinned in place the pilot is laser-scanned in various wind conditions to create accurate 3D computer models. Next, those captured models are injected into computational fluid dynamics software running on a cluster of computers that collectively crunch data at supercomputer speeds to accurately model the passage of air around the pinned wingsuit pilot. This lets the team's aerodynamicists analyse how air flows around the suit, how eddies form and cause drag, and hint at ways they can change the suit \u2013 and the flyer's helmet \u2013 to get the best aerodynamic performance possible. Having done that, they can then make novel suits and test them in the wind tunnel ahead of actual flight tests. The chest rig is attached to a system that moves across six different axes and \u201cthat lets us measure all the forces generated by the wingsuit to a very high accuracy,\" says Grubisic. The researchers are taking on a field with a dramatic history, though it is not entirely clear where the wingsuit itself actually started out \u2013 since many would-be birdmen have leapt from high edifices and balloons wearing suits with flimsy wings. The contraption worn by hapless tailor Franz Reichelt, who leapt to his death from the first stage of the Eiffel Tower in Paris in February 1912, was probably most similar to a modern wingsuit. His large, combined parachute-cum-wing affair did not deploy before he slammed into the ground. The accident was captured on film, too.\u00a0 The key was to separate the parachute \u2013 which offers a safe landing \u2013 from the wings used to extend the freefall. In the 1930s parachutists experimented with suits that allowed them to move on a horizontal plane before they opened their chute. But the key moves came in the 1990s when pioneers in France and the US made suits that used stiff, ribbed structures to keep a traditional wing shape flight \u2013 and the success of these led to a raft of companies making wingsuits commercially. Today's wingsuits are made of soft, stretchy nylon and use air inlets to inflate them in flight, creating pressurised membranes beneath the pilot's outstretched arms and between their legs that generate lift \u2013 a bit like a flying squirrel. But how it flies, and how safely, is very much down to the user's own piloting skills, says Jackie Harper of the Army Parachute Association in Netheravon, Wiltshire. \"After all, owning an F1 car does not make you the best driver,\" she says. In conventional skydiving, people rapidly reach a terminal velocity of 120mph (192km/h). But in a wingsuit, the best flyers can reduce the vertical rate of descent to around 40mph (64km/h) while significantly boosting their forward speed. \"Skydiving feels like falling, mostly,\" says Harper. \"But in a wingsuit it doesn't feel like you're falling because you can really feel your forward speed. And the faster you go the better lift you get: you really do feel like you're flying.\" The current speed record \u2013 set in 2011 \u2013 stands at 226mph (361km/h) \u2013 but the Icarus team hope to go above 280mph (450km/h) with their new suit. It's not all going to be down to clever aeronautics however: they hope to gain some advantage through sheer height. Their aim is to borrow a Boeing C-17 Globemaster III transport, and try and break four world records from an extreme height of 45,000 feet.\u00a0 \"The air density is so low there you can get very high speeds during the initial dive,\" says Grubisic. If they cannot borrow a C-17 a balloon may suffice, he adds. Another reason to fly so high to start with is that records are constantly being broken in wingsuiting: starting off as high as 45,000ft will make it all the harder for other jumpers to beat them. For instance, Harper set a wingsuit flight distance record of 11.2 miles (17.9 kilometres) in August 2015 after being dropped from 20,000ft. But in May, Kyle Lobpries of the USA boosted that to 18.8 miles in wingsuit flight from an altitude of 35,000ft. Lobpries flew for 8.4 minutes, too, breaking a flight-time record set by Harper's husband, Stephen, of 5.9 minutes.\u00a0At that airliner cruise height, Lobpries needed oxygen, as will Grubisic. So, after scanning and computing the performance of their current suits, what can the Project Icarus team actually do to give their wingsuits an edge? \"We're looking at things like wing profile, the wing planform [shape], the drag caused by accessories such as the helmet and the parachute pack. Also the drag caused by the feet and the hands as humans are quite unaerodynamic,\" says Grubisic. Just like Airbus and Boeing are doing with airliners, adding drag-reducing winglets to the suit's wingtips is feasible, too. Blended winglets that curve upwards seem to have had some promising effects in the wind tunnel tests. This scientific approach is backed by Tony Uragallo, founder of Tonysuits, the Florida-based wingsuit maker whose products are generally regarded as the best on the market. But he admits he has always designed his products by trial and error. \"It's totally the way of the future to design the way Angelo is doing it,\" Uragallo says. Harper has a reservation, however: \"The wind tunnel should provide excellent data on the airflow around the suit to help with design, but I\u2019m not sure it 100% accurately reflects the true position in freefall since it is tethered in the tunnel.\" It comes amid a spiking death rate for Base jumpers, many of whom wear wingsuits. In August alone 15 Base jumpers were killed, eight of them dying whilst wearing wingsuits, according to Blinc magazine's Base jumping fatality database. Many people are dying, says Grubisic, because some are \"messing up their initial jump\" from the cliff face, whilst others are stalling the suit while flying close to the ground. \"If you stall a suit flying 30-feet above the ground you've got a problem,\" he says. One reason suits stall is because they are not necessarily well-designed \u2013 and the Project Icarus team hope their better performing, record-breaking suit could give users a longer, safer ride. They may well do that. But Uragallo, a skydiver himself, is not entirely convinced, saying safety is more about attitude. \"Better flying suits are safer yes, but the guys\u00a0will just try to fly over higher peaks. \u201cIt's not the suits that are really killing us.\"\u00a0 Join 700,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn and Instagram If you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

            "text": "A consortium wants to bring the supersonic Concorde back into the air. But just how feasible is it to return a retired plane back into service? BBC Future investigates. On 26 November 2003, one of the more glamorous chapters in aviation history ended. This was the day the last Concorde flight took place, with one of British Airways\u2019 needle-nosed fleet touching down for the final time at Filton Airfield, near Bristol. The end of the Concorde meant the public could no longer fly faster than the speed of sound (although, it must be said, this was only ever an option for passengers willing to pay a hefty price). Concorde was one of only two civilian aircraft capable of flying at supersonic speeds; the other was a physically similar Soviet design called the Tupolev Tu-144. In the 12 years since British Airways and Air France called time on Concorde operations (more than 25 years after the Tu-144\u2019s last passenger-carrying flight), no other aircraft have emerged to fill this faster-than-a-bullet gap. This month, though, a consortium called Club Concorde announced that they have amassed \u00a3120m ($182m) in funds to buy a mothballed Concorde and restore it to flying condition. They will also purchase a second to be installed as a tourist attraction near the London Eye. \u00a0 But does this plan make sense? What would it take to get a plane that has been sitting in a museum hangar \u2013 or even sitting outside, exposed to the elements \u2013 back into the air? It is natural, says BBC columnist and author Jonathan Glancey, to pine for the Concorde\u2019s return. To many, the idea of the \u2018jet-set\u2019 lifestyle was personified by the huge, delta-winged airliner, whose roar as it climbed out of Heathrow was a familiar sound to anyone who lived under its flight path in the late 20th Century. \u201cIt was the most beautiful airliner yet built, a technical tour-de-force, an aerodynamic masterpiece,\u201d says Glancey, whose book Concorde: the Rise and Fall of a Supersonic Airliner is released in October. \u201cIt was a rare glimpse of a future that never quite happened and that people had dreamed of when young in the Fifties, Sixties and Seventies. British trade unions, the French Communist Party and politicians of contrary persuasions were all fans of Concorde, while those who could never afford to fly it still loved the aircraft. \u201cIt still tugs on heartstrings like the Spitfire, Lancaster and Vulcan, all military aircraft, of course: Concorde could outfly pretty much every contemporary military aircraft in level, long-distance high-flight. There would be no shortage of passengers queuing up to fly on board a revived Concorde.\u201d Sonic booms But simply wanting to get a mothballed aircraft back in the air is, of course, not enough to make it fly. Concorde may have looked space age compared to the more workmanlike Airbuses and Boeings, but it was not a new aircraft when it was retired. Its design stemmed from research vehicles which first flew in the 1950s; one of the other aircraft which resulted from this research was the hugely successful French-made Mirage III fighter, the first European aircraft to fly at twice the speed of sound. Much of the Concorde\u2019s design is therefore 50s-era \u2013 and none of it more so than the incredibly noisy and fuel-hungry Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus engines which powered it. These use an enormous amount of fuel; the Concorde used more fuel to taxi to the end of the runway than a Boeing 737 uses to fly from London to Amsterdam, former British Airways chief engineer Jim O'Sullivan told The Scotsman in 2012. Many believe it was the fatal Concorde crash in Paris in 2000 \u2013 the only Concorde to crash during its career \u2013 that hastened its demise. Much more important was the enormous cost of keeping Concordes in the air, as well as other environmental factors. Breaking the sound barrier creates sonic booms, and these booms can be incredibly disturbing if done over land. As a result, the Concorde was not allowed to reach its full Mach 2 speed until it was over water. \u201cFrom a technical point of view, it should be able to fly, but the Civil Aviation Authority will have to be convinced,\u201d Glancey says. \u201cFrom an environmental point of view, a solitary noisy aircraft might be acceptable. After all, many people enjoy racing cars screaming around tracks, and far more love watching noisy fireworks displays. If the skies were full of supersonic airliners, that would be a very different matter.\u201d Many people believe Air France and British Airways \u2013 the only two airlines which operated the aircraft \u2013 retired it too quickly. \"The only real reason for Concorde's retirement was politics, and that remains the single obstacle in the way of her return to the skies,\" Ben Lord of the Save Concorde Group told the BBC back in 2013. One group knows full well what it takes to get a retired aircraft back in the air. The Avro Vulcan was a Royal Air Force jet bomber which served from 1956 until 1984; originally designed as a nuclear bomber, it\u2019s best known for the record-setting flight undertaken to disable Port Stanley airport after Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands in 1982. Vulcans were retired in 1984.. But Robert Pleming, a former IT director who has been a lifelong aviation fan, had the idea of bringing it back to flying condition in 1997 \u2013 13 years after the Vulcan had been retired. The Vulcan XH558 had flown as part of the Vulcan Display Flight until 1992, when it was put on display at an aircraft museum in England. The Vulcan To The Sky Trust then spent the next 10 years raising funds to get the bomber back in the air, which it did in October 2007. Returning an aircraft like the Vulcan to service is not an easy task. Everything has to be checked \u2013 from the strength of the airframe to the engines to the seals and every last scrap of wiring. \u201cOur experience is that it takes twice as long and costs twice as much as you first thought,\u201d Pleming says. \u201cIt ended up taking us 26 months and cost \u00a37m.\u201d The Vulcan could not fly as fast as Concorde \u2013 its maximum speed was just under the speed of sound, around 645mph (1,030km/h), less than half the Concorde\u2019s cruising speed. The aircraft also could be returned to the sky under different regulations intended for ex-military aircraft. Those that affect Concorde are much more stringent, because it was an aircraft intended to carry passengers. It would have to pass those airworthy certificates before it could fly again, Pleming says. That is likely to cost much, much more than \u00a37m. Bear in mind, too, that the Concorde was at the bleeding edge of aviation and engineering knowledge and considerably more complex than the subsonic Vulcan. And every single part of it, from the airframe to the air conditioning wiring, would need to be rigorously checked and, if needed, replaced.\u00a0 Technical headaches The Vulcan team were lucky in that they had access to several of the aircraft\u2019s Bristol Olympus engines which had never been used \u2013 known as \u2018zero-hour\u2019 engines. Jet engines require regular maintenance for every hour they are operated, and have a limited life. Engines that have never been used greatly increase the amount of time a plane can be kept in the air. But there are no zero-hour Concorde engines left. And any other spare parts would be almost impossible to find. It has been 12 years since a Concorde last flew, but nearly 40 years since the production lines in Britain and France closed down. The technicians who helped create the aircraft\u2019s parts are either long retired or dead. \u201cA lot of the original technical documentation you would need is no longer around,\u201d Pleming adds. The Vulcan project was able to recover all it needed, but it wasn\u2019t necessarily a simple task: \u201cOne of the records we needed for the aircraft\u2019s undercarriage was eventually found in the back of a fire-proof safe in a warehouse in Wolverhampton.\u201d Even if a Concorde airframe could be bought back to flying condition, an even bigger hurdle remains. Airbus, which built many Concorde parts, decided it would no longer support uptake of the Concorde fleet back in 2003, which hastened its demise. Airbus never indicated it would support a return of the aircraft. It is exactly that withdrawal of engineering support \u2013 from BAe Systems \u2013 that will ground Vulcan XH558 next month, despite the fact the aircraft airframe is strong enough to allow it another two years of flying displays. The Concorde faces seemingly insurmountable challenges if it is to fly again. Ironically, its Russian rival, the Tupolev Tu-144, did make a return to the skies long after it had stopped flying passengers. In the late 1990s, a Tu-144 was extensively remodified \u2013 including refitting it with more modern engines \u2013 and used as a flying laboratory by Nasa. Last year, it was reported that Tupolev offered to return a Tu-144 to flying condition and fly it over the city of Sochi to mark the 2014 Winter Olympics. The money that could be poured into trying to get a Concorde back into the air might be better spent funding a more modern replacement, says Glancey. \u201cAlthough there are a number of proposals for supersonic executive jets, the real challenge for scientists, engineers and manufacturers is to create a form of quiet supersonic aircraft,\u201d he says. \u201cIt might yet happen, but not for a while. In any case, Concorde is a part of aviation history and mythology: many people want to see Concorde in the air just as they do Spitfires.\u201d This story is a part of BBC Britain \u2013 a new series focused on exploring this extraordinary island, one story at a time.

            "text": "Aeroplanes are incredibly polluting, but could we ever live completely without them? Aviation has long been a pain in the neck for those working to cut human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. It is the pinnacle of a \"hard-to-decarbonise\" sector: energy-intensive, lacking in immediate technical options to make it lower carbon, and strongly associated with the lifestyles of the richest and most powerful in society. It has also become one of the fastest growing sectors emissions-wise. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from planes grew 30% between 2013 and 2019\u00a0while\u00a0the CO2 emissions growth in the wider economy between the same years was just 4%. The pandemic, of course, stopped this trend in its tracks. As flights were grounded across the world, aviation's CO2 emissions plummeted by up to 60% in 2020. But some experts still expect Covid-19 to only delay aviation's overall contribution to warming by a few years: one recent paper by leading climate scientists projected that the sector will contribute a 6-17% share of the remaining carbon budget to avoid exceeding 1.5-2C of global warming. Demand management \u2013 essentially people flying less \u2013 is the most effective way to reduce these emissions this decade, according to a recent report from Transport & Environment, an environmental non-profit organisatoin. Technologies such as sustainable aviation fuels, more efficient planes and electric aircraft will play a bigger role in the 2030s, it said. In recent years, activists have urged people to consider flying less, or not at all, to help restrain ballooning emissions from aviation. Interestingly, when the UK tasked a citizens' climate assembly with finding fair and socially acceptable ways to decarbonise the British economy, frequent flyer levies \u2013 a demand-control measure \u2013 were among the policies they proposed for meeting climate targets. But what would happen if people across the world suddenly stopped flying completely? A world of no flights would present some serious logistical challenges, but could also open up the door to huge changes to other, lower-carbon forms of transport. We are unlikely to ever cut out aviation completely, and we likely wouldn't want to. But posing this hypothetical question opens up the door to what we could be doing far more of to reduce aviation's heavy impact on the climate. A boost to climate goals Grounding all flights on Earth would immediately put a stop to the 2.5% (and growing) of annual CO2 emissions which come from burning fuel in aeroplanes, cutting CO2 emissions by around one billion tonnes per year and eliminating a sector previously leading to rising emissions. But aviation has other climate impacts too, meaning that the immediate impact on warming of stopping all flights would be far larger than the reduction in CO2 alone. \"In addition to CO2, there's a variety of other effects that planes cause,\" says Sally Cairns, a transport policy researcher at the University of Leeds. \"The shortest-term effect, and one of the biggest effects, is the formation of contrails, which are the white lines you see in the sky and the associated formation of cirrus clouds.\" Unlike CO2, which stays in the atmosphere for centuries, these non-CO2 emissions have a short-term, but very strong, warming impact which has been estimated as potentially tripling the overall warming effect of aviation compared to CO2 alone. Impact on people But how would this new world without aeroplanes affect people around the globe? Many people's daily lives would be unaffected, at least directly. Just 11% of the global population took a flight in 2018 and at most 4% took an international flight. Even in the UK, over half of people didn't fly at all in a given year, even before the pandemic. Around the globe, most flights are taken by a tiny minority of frequent flyers. \"It doesn't affect many people at all on that basis,\" says Stefan G\u00f6ssling, aviation researcher at Linnaeus University in Sweden. \"We had a period with close to zero flights [due to the Covid-19 pandemic], and I think what we learned is that we can do without.\" Airports would go silent, providing relief to locals previously impacted by the noise. In a matter of days, the elevated air pollution levels found near to airports would also drop, with a knock-on reduction in health risks such as asthma and heart disease for local residents. People with homes in two countries would hastily have to choose which location they wanted to live in, while people who fly frequently for weekend trips and holidays would also face a large change in lifestyle. Holidays would mostly need to be done in places accessible by train, bus, car and ferry, nudging people towards staying in their own or nearby countries. Countries with large tourism deficits \u2013 meaning people from that country spend more on holiday abroad than the tourists visiting the country spend \u2013 would benefit from this. China, which has the world's largest tourism deficit, and the UK, which had a tourism deficit of \u00a334bn ($42bn) in 2019 would be among the winners economically (although the UK government also estimates that the aviation industry contributes at least \u00a322bn ($27bn) to the UK economy). You might also like: This could in turn lead to better leisure opportunities for local people in these economies, also providing new jobs, says Cairns. \"If you make it an attractive place for people within your country to come and visit, you probably also mean that the local residents have better facilities.\" But other countries would be hard hit \u2013 especially islands heavily dependent on tourism and largely only accessible by plane. The huge decline in travellers in 2020 put over 100 million tourism jobs in jeopardy: many would be permanently lost. \"As much as there would be problems from stopping air travel tomorrow, I would put that at the top of the list,\" says Leo Murray, director of innovation at climate charity Possible. \"It's probably the most important thing. Because there's a whole bunch of people who would need to find new livelihoods.\" Other countries would need to find ways to support these countries, he adds. The grounding of all planes would also affect the 11 million people around the world who work directly in the aviation industry, such as airport operators, customs and immigration roles, flight attendants, pilots and engineers. A further 18 million people working in businesses supported by aviation indirectly, such as fuel suppliers and call centres, would also face unemployment. Another difficult challenge would be people who live far away from their loved ones and families. \"Probably the most challenging area is visiting family and friends,\" says Cairns. \"I think that would cause the greatest pain.\" Malithi Fernando, a policy analyst at the International Transport Forum, thinks many people would end up living closer to the people they visit often. Many people would relocate to be closer to their loved ones, requiring more flexible workplaces allowing remote work and more time for travel, she says. Corporate climate targets would see an instant boost as business travel ground to a halt \u2013 90% of business travel emissions currently come from aviation. Attending conferences and business meetings in other countries would become the exception, with virtual meetings now the standard. But projects which require in-person visits would struggle to adjust. Some supply chains would also see disruption: just 1% of global trade by volume is transported by air, but products sent by aeroplane tend to be high value. Some of this freight, such as paper, printed books and vehicle parts, could be transported by ship, lowering their carbon footprints to one-tenth or one-twentieth of their previous level, though supply chains and timelines would need huge adjustments. Businesses and consumers are becoming increasingly used to having globally sourced goods delivered within days: a world with no flying would lengthen this time considerably. Food air freight would also require adjustment. The 47,000 tonnes of fresh or chilled fish flown from London Heathrow airport each year, for example, would need to be delivered frozen if going by ship. Highly perishable fresh fruits and vegetables like grapes, mangoes and avocados would disappear from supermarkets in the winter, with a rise in the consumption of frozen fruits instead. The availability of flowers grown overseas would plummet. \"There's lots of things that are flown because of their short shelf-life and because you want them fresh on the table,\" says G\u00f6ssling. However, you would not see major shortages in supermarkets or clothing stores in a world without planes, says Fernando. \"[Bulk goods] are transported using a very different supply chain network, shipping across oceans, and then road or rail or barges and inland waterways. So overall, I think there would be a smaller impact on freight.\" Some air cargo is lifesaving, however. Air freight is used to ship medical supplies and pharmaceuticals around the world. It played a major role in delivering vaccines during the pandemic, for example. It is also used during humanitarian disasters to deliver food, water and medicines. Finding alternatives for delivering time-sensitive medicines or urgent food supplies around the world would not be easy. \"With more hurricanes, typhoons, and everything else caused by climate change [this] obviously isn't going to go away, it might become an increasing issue,\" says Cairns. Travelling far in a world without planes A world where flying was abruptly stopped would create many complications for travel. \"'Suddenly' is always bad for people because it forces them to make decisions and everything is very disruptive,\" says G\u00f6ssling. \"So if you really change things overnight, it's difficult.\" Aviation has a unique combination of two factors not seen together in any other transport mode, says Fernando. Firstly, it's fast, both in terms of its speed and its ability to go directly from a to b, easily passing over seas, mountains and lakes. Second, unlike rail and road, it does not require dedicated infrastructure en route between two destinations, so typically requires lower investment up front. The best alternative to aeroplanes when it comes to speed is high-speed rail \u2013 trains with average speeds over around 200km (124 miles) per hour. \"It's the only way we can move a great number of people at high speeds over large distances at a reasonable price,\" says G\u00f6ssling. China is the undisputed leader in high-speed rail, with well over half the world's lines \u2013 some 40,000km (25,000 miles)of high-speed rail lines, with plans to raise this to 70,000km (43.000 miles) by 2035. China's longest route is almost 2,300km (1,400 miles), stretching between Beijing and Guangzhou, a similar distance to that between New York and Miami, or Paris and Tallinn, with a travel time of approximately eight hours. \"[China] has done great work in terms of not just establishing high-speed railways but also in terms of creating some of the best in the world, without vibrations, that are really, really comfortable in terms of taking people at high speeds through the country,\" says G\u00f6ssling. Japan, Europe and South Korea also have fairly strong networks. The US, though, has yet to complete a single high-speed rail line. A recent analysis from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) found that even today, around 26% of US flights could be replaced by car, bus or high-speed rail. Another 28% of flights could in theory be replaced by high-speed rail, but are between less populated urban centres, meaning not enough people would travel on them make the investment in high-speed rail infrastructure worth it, says Sola Zheng, a researcher at ICCT who did the analysis. In a world of no flying, however, there would likely be more political and taxpayer willingness to build high-speed rail, as well as a higher tolerance for travel time, says Zheng. Attention would also increase on ultra-high-speed trains. The world's current fastest train, the Shanghai Maglev, has a maximum commercial speed of 460km (286 miles) per hour and an even faster magnetic levitation line is being built in Japan, which will have a maximum speed of 505 km (314 miles) per hour. Where high-speed networks wouldn't work due to high upfront costs, lower speed rail would also be a good option, says Fernando. \"Regular rail networks might make more sense in a larger variety of situations.\" Sleeper trains could make overnight travel of 8-12 hours convenient. There is scope for far more innovation and development on sleeper trains, says Cairns. \"The consequence is that the journey becomes part of the holiday.\" The money previously spent on subsidies to airports and airlines could go instead to rolling out this rail network. Huge care would be needed in doing this though, as rail infrastructure can have negative impacts on local people and natural habitats. \"There are also of course emissions associated with the infrastructure,\" notes Fernando. Most important for rail would be avoiding any new non-electrified rail networks, she adds. Without planes, long-distance coaches would also become seen as a viable way to travel long distances, especially with a focus on comfort. Fernando notes that buses have one of the two unique factors aviation has: the flexibility of not requiring new en route infrastructure. \"You're likely going to be using roads that are already there. So they are a low-investment option for longer distance travel.\" The expansion of other ways to travel would also provide new jobs for newly unemployed aviation workers, from engineers to flight attendants. \"Airlines have always had this kind of cachet as a sort of luxury kind of leisure type activity,\" says Cairns. You could imagine a luxury airline running luxury coach tours to Spain with a stopover in a French chateau or gourmet market on the way, for instance, she says. Driverless cars, once they become available, could also provide a viable alternative to flying, allowing people to sleep or work through long journeys. However, large-scale use of single-occupancy driverless cars \u2013 even if they are electric \u2013 would be bad news for the climate and congestion, says Fernando. A shared-occupancy model could overcome this issue, she adds. Cross ocean Of course, there's one obvious gap where rail and road simply couldn't help: journeys across seas and oceans. In a world of no flying, the main alternative would be ships: already used to move around the vast majority of the world's freight. Travelling from England to New York by ship takes around seven nights; journeys further afield take weeks. Personal journeys of this kind would plummet, with people only willing to undertake them for unique reasons or very infrequently. \"I find it a little bit hard to imagine overseas passenger transport becoming hugely popular unless we have some sort of lifestyle changes,\" says Fernando. Of course, ships themselves release plenty of carbon, and a vast increase in passenger travel would be bad news for the climate. Slowing ships down is among the main short-term measures for reducing shipping emissions, Fernando notes: not a great proposition for speedy cross-ocean journeys. Airships \u2013 large, balloon-like vehicles which use gases lighter than air, such as helium or hydrogen, to keep them in the air \u2013 are far slower than aeroplanes, but could potentially meet some of the needs currently met via air travel. \"I think airships would probably compare favourably with ships,\" says Murray. \"And probably passengers would prefer airships, because you get seasick on the ocean.\" They could be especially useful for passenger transport to island nations, behind deserts, or across mountain ranges, he adds. However, airships would likely struggle to transport many people quickly across long distances. \"It's hard to see how that could ever be scaled up to become a significant transport,\" says G\u00f6ssling. \"To build such huge structures in ways that are really storm proof, for instance, I think that would be very difficult.\" Changing technology To accommodate the longer times needed to travel by ship and train, employers would need to become more flexible in how they give holidays, or allow people to work on the journey. There would also be fresh impetus for new creative thinking about how to better connect people together without the need for long-distance travel. More money would pour into technology companies developing better virtual meeting spaces, further accelerating the technology beyond the changes seen in the Covid-19 pandemic. Cairns foresees meetings where all participants are either there physically or represented by a screen, with remote control cameras and directional sound replicating the experience of people actually being at the table with you. Fully virtual spaces would also flourish. G\u00f6ssling imagines conferences using scanned 3D avatars of participants which can easily move towards and interact together, allowing them to feel they are really there. The major pediment would probably be people joining from different time zones, he adds. Meanwhile, empty airports around the world could be repurposed for other activities, such as hosting conferences, meetings or festivals. \"Airports tend to be where you get transport links converging. So you've got very good connectivity if people wanted to get to those [as] meeting hubs.\" Airports could also be used as local community spaces. \"You can also imagine them becoming active travel parks where people can go and try out scooters and hoverboards and bikes and everything else,\" says Cairns. Grounded planes themselves could be used for unique hospitality spaces, such as hotels, restaurants and clubs It's unlikely we'll ever wake up to a world without any planes. And we wouldn't want to: aviation has brought cultures together, prompted new experiences and journeys and provides urgent medicines, humanitarian aid and support for people in need. But the huge climate impact of flying, and the difficulty in decarbonising the sector in the short-to-medium term, does raise the question of whether we should put more focus on other ways to travel, as well as avoiding travelling long-distance when we don't really need to. \"[For] a major reduction in aviation, I think it's about when not if. I think the climate data is clear on that really,\" says Cairns. \"If we could get it down to just the hardcore of stuff that we thought was really essential, then actually we could manage that fine. But we have to go from such a different place given where we are at now.\" Fortunately, opportunities do already exist to reduce our dependence on aviation. A focus on our own communities, local tourism and virtual meeting places, as we've already seen during the pandemic, could go a long way towards reducing the urge to fly. In trains, meanwhile, which are far lower carbon than planes, we have a strong alternative to planes. The International Energy Agency has highlighted the shift from aeroplanes and private cars to rail as a key strategy for reaching net zero emissions, and advised governments to set out targeted policies to improve rail. High-speed rail in particular can replace air travel, with new lines reducing aviation transport on the same routes by as much as 80%. But slower rail is just as important: sleeper trains are now having a \"renaissance\" in Europe, for example, driven by passenger concern for the climate. By 2030, the world needs to cut annual greenhouse gas emissions by around 25 times aviation\u2019s current emissions on top of what governments have already pledged to limit global warming to 1.5C. So eliminating aviation would make a small, but still significant, contribution to closing the gap between our current emissions pathway and where we need to be. If the aviation industry begins seriously decarbonising planes, we can ultimately hope to move to a world where zero carbon trains and planes are equally as common. For now, though, reducing flights as much as possible remains our best option for limiting the large climate impact of this sector.

            "text": "Australian airline Qantas has bid farewell to its last Boeing 747 aeroplane with one final flourish - drawing its logo, the flying kangaroo, in the sky. Dozens gathered at Sydney Airport on Wednesday to wave goodbye to QF7474, writing messages on the plane's body and reading tributes. The impact of the virus on travel means the 747 and others were retired by Qantas six months earlier than planned. It will sit in the US Mojave Desert.  \"It's hard to overstate the impact that the 747 had on aviation and a country as far away as Australia,\" said CEO Alan Joyce. \"This aircraft was well ahead of its time and extremely capable. [It] put international travel within reach of the average Australian and people jumped at the opportunity.\" Last month Qantas said it would axe 6,000 jobs as part of its plans to survive the coronavirus pandemic. Around 150 people gathered to say goodbye to the plane, which was also given a water cannon salute. Originally, thousands were expected for a farewell planned for the end of the year. The Qantas 747 fleet has carried more than 250 million people in almost half a century of service, including Queen Elizabeth II and every Australian Olympic team since 1984, said a Reuters report. Qantas has grounded most of its international flights until at least July 2021 due to the lack of international travel demand.  Last week, British Airways announced that it would also retire all of its Boeing 747s, adding that it would operate more flights on more fuel-efficient planes such as the new Airbus A350s and Boeing 787 Dreamliners.  BA is the world's largest operator of the jumbo jets - nicknamed the 'Queen of the Skies' - with 31 in its fleet.  The retired planes will join hundreds of others parked in the Mojave Desert. The climate conditions in such places - dry heat, low humidity and little rain - mean aircraft take a lot longer to rust and degrade.",

            "text": "Iran has said it will not hand over black box flight recorders recovered from a plane that crashed with 176 people on board to manufacturer Boeing or to the US. The Ukrainian Boeing 737-800 went down just minutes after taking off from Tehran's airport, leaving no survivors. Under global aviation rules, Iran has the right to lead the investigation. But manufacturers are typically involved and experts say few countries are capable of analysing black boxes. The crash came at a time of high tensions between Iran and the US and just hours after Iran carried out missile strikes on two air bases housing US forces in Iraq. There is no evidence that the two events are linked.  Normally, the US National Transportation Safety Board would have a role to play in any international investigations involving US-made Boeings. But the board must act with permission and in accordance with legislation of the foreign country concerned. In comments published by Iran's conservative Mehr news agency, the head of Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation (CAO), Ali Abedzadeh, said: \"We will not give the black box to the manufacturer and the Americans.\" \"This accident will be investigated by Iran's aviation organisation but the Ukrainians can also be present,\" he added.  Mr Abedzadeh said it was not yet clear which country would analyse the black boxes - a cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder.  Boeing said it was \"ready to assist in any way needed\", while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country expected to have a role in the investigation and had offered technical assistance.  The Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 to Kyiv had 176 people on board when it crashed in Iran on Wednesday.  The majority of passengers were from Iran and Canada. Ukraine's Tehran embassy initially blamed engine failure but later removed the statement, saying any comment regarding the cause of the accident prior to a commission's inquiry was not official. There was good visibility when the plane went down near Iran's capital, according to the Flightradar24 aviation website. Officials from the airline said the crew were experienced. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned against \"speculation or unchecked theories regarding the catastrophe\" until official reports were ready. Iranian media blamed technical problems and quoted an aviation official who said no emergency had been declared.  Mr Abedzadeh said \"terrorism\" had played no role in the crash, according to Mehr.   Among the victims were 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians including all nine crew, 10 Swedes, four Afghans, three Britons and three Germans, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said. Fifteen of the dead were children. But the German government later said \"we currently have no knowledge that German citizens are among the victims of the plane crash in Iran\". Iran's head of emergency operations said 147 of the victims were Iranian. That would suggest that 65 of the foreign nationals had dual nationalities. The Ukrainian airline gave a helpline number for further information about passengers: +38-044-581-50-19. Mr Trudeau said 138 passengers on the flight were en route to Canada via Kyiv. \"All people who won't be coming home to their parents, their friends, their colleagues or their family,\" he said. \"All had so much potential, so much life ahead of them\". Flight data from the Ukrainian Airlines Boeing 737-800 is openly available online. It shows that the plane climbed normally after taking-off from Tehran.  It reached nearly 8,000ft (2,400m) before the aircraft's data suddenly disappears.  This is unusual and would suggest some type of catastrophic incident on board the plane. We have no evidence at this stage to tell us what caused the incident.  According to a former air crash investigator, any suggestion of engine failure feels premature. This possibility can't be ruled out at this early stage but an airliner such as the Boeing 737-800 is designed to keep flying if there is an engine failure.  Plus, if there was a failure then we would normally expect the flight data to show the plane's climb becoming less steep.  Have you been personally affected by this story?

            "title": "Victims' families slam report into 737 Max crashes",
            "text": "Relatives of a man killed in one of two crashes involving a Boeing 737 Max have condemned a report into the disasters. The expert panel behind the report concluded the system used to certify the aircraft as safe was \"effective\". But the family of Joseph Waithaka has described the report as \"an extremely appalling and disappointing attempt to defend a flawed system\". Mr Waithaka died in March when an Ethiopian Airlines jet crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa. The report, from a committee set up to look at the processes involved in clearing the aircraft to fly, concluded that the regulators were right to delegate a significant amount of certification work to Boeing itself.  The 737 Max is Boeing's fastest selling aircraft. An updated version of the company's short- and medium-haul workhorse, it was designed to be much more fuel efficient than its predecessors. But the model has been grounded since March. Regulators banned it from flying in the aftermath of a crash in Ethiopia, in which 157 people were killed. It was the second major accident involving the plane in the space of a few months. In November 2018, 189 people died when a 737 Max crashed into the sea off Indonesia. In both cases, it is believed a flight control system known as MCAS activated at the wrong time, forcing the nose of the aircraft downwards when the aircraft was meant to be climbing. It did so because it relied on data from a single sensor, which appears to have failed on both aircraft. In the wake of the accidents, Boeing has faced intense criticism for allowing an apparently flawed aircraft onto the market. The US regulator - the Federal Aviation Administration - has been condemned for failing in its duty of oversight.  There have been widespread suggestions that the relationship between the two was simply too cosy, and that too much of the work needed to certify the aircraft as safe to fly was delegated to Boeing itself. And last week, internal messages released by Boeing prompted further criticism. In one, an employee described the 737 Max as \"designed by clowns who are in turn supervised by monkeys\".  Other messages were derogatory about the FAA, and showed how Boeing staff had attempted to put pressure on the regulator.  However, the expert panel found little to criticise in the process that had cleared the aircraft to fly. The panel was set up in April last year by the Secretary of transportation, Elaine Chao. It was chaired by Lee Moak, a former president of the Air Line Pilots Association and Darren McDew, a former Air Force commander.  The report said the panel \"found the FAA's overall certification system to be effective\" - although it added that \"reforms must be adopted to help our extremely safe aviation system become even better at identifying and mitigating risk\". It also endorsed the system of delegating certification work to Boeing itself, calling it \"an appropriate and effective tool for conducting aircraft certification\". It went on to say the system was \"solidly established, well controlled, and promotes safety through effective oversight\". The review did set out a list of improvements it said should be made to the certification system.  Among them, it recommended introducing measures to take greater account of human factors, and how pilots might interact with automated systems. It also suggested expanding the use of detailed and comprehensive evaluations of individual systems and taking steps to protect the independence of employees carrying out certification tasks. But the family of Mr Wathaika told the BBC they were deeply disappointed by the report.  \"It's a shock that there were minimal and feeble suggestions for change despite the magnitude of loss as a result of the current systems,\" his daughter, Zipporah Kuria, said. \"Boeing has been extremely untrustworthy, deceitful and profit-driven. As families who have paid the price for that, we hope that the FAA would look to attain a higher level of safety,\" she said \"Following this report would mean that the FAA's level of safety would remain the same, which has already dearly cost us, as victim families, so much - not once but twice\".  That view was shared by Michael Stumo, whose daughter Samya was also on the Ethiopian plane. He told the Associated Press the report endorsed self-regulation by Boeing.  \"This report is written as if by pre-crash industry lobbyists defending the current certification system,\" he said. The report also had a lukewarm reception from the chair of the Transportation Committee in the US House of Representatives, which has been holding a lengthy inquiry into the 737 Max. In a statement, Democrat congressman, Peter De Fazio, said: \"Our investigation has already revealed multiple junctures at which the current certification process failed.\" He added that 346 people had died \"because the system failed\". \"Not addressing the failures head on would be a grave mistake,\" he said. However, the expert panel's findings were backed by the senior Republican on the committee. Congressman Sam Graves - who has previously insisted that pilot error was a factor in both crashes involving the 737 Max - described the report as an \"unbiased expert review\".  He said it \"confirms aviation in the United States is safe and that we remain the global gold standard for aviation safety\". ",

            "text": "The dispute over subsidies to aircraft makers has escalated, with Washington imposing a higher tariff on Airbus and aeroplane parts from the EU. It will go up from 10% to 15% next month, while most other tariffs on EU exports to America, on a range of goods, standing at 25%, are retained.  The US Trade Representative pulled back on including salmon and blended Scotch. But the Scotch Whisky Association said it was \"deeply disappointed\" the tariff will be retained.  It covers single malts and liqueurs from Scotland and Northern Ireland. While the UK has now left the EU, current rules on trade will continue during the transition period until the start of 2021 while new trading relationships are negotiated.  The distillers' group issued a new estimate that the cost to the industry is likely to be more than \u00a3100m in annual exports.  Tariffs will also be retained on cashmere jumpers from Scotland and British \"sweet biscuits\", of which the biggest export is Scottish shortbread. Some types of meat and dairy produce from the European Union and UK have also faced tariffs since 15 October, along with books, tools and some shellfish and fruit. Only two small changes have been made to the list of goods covered by the US tariffs which began in October; kitchen knives from France and Germany have been added, but prune juice has been removed. The action by the office of the US Trade Representative is targeted mainly at the countries where Airbus is built - primarily the UK, France, Germany and Spain. The legal statement issued on Friday night in Washington said: \"The United States remains open to a negotiated settlement that addresses current and future subsidies to Airbus provided by the EU and certain current and former member states\". It said it had considered putting up the tariff rate as high as 100%, but after receiving 26,000 responses to a consultation begun in mid-December, it decided not to do so.   However, there was a warning in Friday's statement of further escalation by Washington if there is retaliation against the higher aircraft tariff by the European Union, or to pursue EU claims that there are unfair subsidies paid to Boeing in the US. Karen Betts, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, commented: \"We're deeply disappointed that a 25% tariff remains in place on exports of single malt Scotch whisky and liqueurs to the United States.  \"This tariff has now been in place for four months and is hitting Scotch whisky producers hard, particularly small distilleries.  We've seen a significant drop in exports already, and based on this we believe we could be facing at least \u00a3100m in lost exports over a year. \"The EU, US and UK must now redouble their efforts to resolve transatlantic trade disputes quickly, so that Scotch and American whiskies can return to the tariff-free trade from which we have benefitted for more than 20 years.  It cannot be right that our industry is continuing to pay the price of trade disputes that have nothing to do with our sector.\" The industry group has welcomed comments from Prime Minister Boris Johnson that he intends to use the post-Brexit freedom to manage trade to end the 25% EU tariff on imports of US whiskey, which was introduced as part of a separate trade dispute with the European Union, over steel tariffs. Paul Everitt, chief executive of aerospace trade body ADS, urged the EU and US authorities to work together to remove the threat of tariffs. He said: \"Low tariffs on aerospace products globally have helped give consumers safe, technology advanced and increasingly fuel efficient aircraft that connect global communities. \"We urge the EU and US authorities to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution that removes the threat of tariffs and sustains competitive markets.\"",

Sierra Nevada, the private company that builds the spaceplane, has chosen the Vulcan rocket as its ride into orbit. The company hopes to start launching missions by 2021, to deliver supplies to astronauts on the ISS. Neither the Dream Chaser vehicle, nor the Vulcan rocket, has yet flown to space. Sierra Nevada was recently awarded the contract by Nasa to re-supply the ISS. It joins two other private companies that already ship cargo and experiments to the station - SpaceX and Orbital ATK. The Vulcan Centaur rocket, built by United Launch Alliance (ULA), is currently in production. Under its Nasa contract, Dream Chaser has to fly a minimum of six missions to the ISS. The first of these will serve as the Vulcan Centaur's second \"certification flight\" - which will validate the rocket. \"Our first launch is 2021, so we can't wait to have the first successful mission,\" said Sierra Nevada Corp's chief executive Fatih Ozmen at a news conference in Louisville, Colorado. \"[Dream Chaser] is the only privately-owned, commercial spaceplane in the world that exists that is runway- and landing-capable and reusable.\" Dream Chaser will deliver more than 5,443kg (12,000 lbs) of cargo to the space station, remaining attached for up to 75 days as an orbiting laboratory. When the missions end, the vehicle will return through the atmosphere and land at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The Vulcan Centaur will use BE-4 engines developed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's space company Blue Origin. Tory Bruno, chief executive of ULA, said the Vulcan was currently \"on time\" for its journey to the launch pad in 2021. But he added that if a delay did arise, ULA would use its Atlas V rocket as a back-up. Dream Chaser was designed as a crew vehicle. Sierra Nevada Corp competed for the Nasa contract to send astronauts to the ISS, under the agency's Commercial Crew Program. The contract eventually went to Boeing and SpaceX, but Sierra Nevada made it to the final round. And the company still wants the spaceplane to fly astronauts one day. \"The bridge to a crewed vehicle is not that far,\" said John Curry, programme director for Dream Chaser. \"The capability is there and we're more than happy to do it, whether it's for Nasa or for somebody else. \"Crewed missions are coming, we just need to build it and they will come.\"  Follow Paul on Twitter.",

            "text": "Boeing has reported its worst annual orders in at least two decades - as it remains in crisis over its 737 Max model. The company also said deliveries of its planes slumped to an 11-year low last year. It means the US firm has lost its title as the world's biggest plane maker to European rival Airbus. The 737 Max has been grounded since March after two crashes in which 346 people were killed. Boeing said net orders after cancellations for 2019 totalled just 54 planes. That compares with 893 the previous year. At the same time deliveries fell by 53% to 380 planes, the lowest number since 2007. The company last month halted production of what had been its best-selling commercial airliner. The grounding of the 737 Max means it is impossible for the firm to deliver the planes to customers. In comparison, Boeing's main rival Airbus said earlier this month that it delivered a record 863 planes in 2019 and racked up a net 768 orders after cancellations. A bright spot for the Chicago-based plane maker was a record number of deliveries of 787 Dreamliners in the last three months of 2019. The company delivered 45 of the wide-body passenger jets, which first went into service in 2011. Boeing's new chief executive David Calhoun took the helm of the manufacturer on Monday. Mr Calhoun said he is \"confident in the future\" of the firm, telling staff his \"primary focus\" will be returning the 737 Max to the skies. He replaced Dennis Muilenburg, who was fired last month, in a move the company's board said was necessary to \"restore confidence\" in Boeing. The aviation industry is also feeling the pressure over fears of a global economic slowdown and the US-China trade war.",

            "text": "Flybe has warned shareholders it will wind up the company if they do not back a sale to a consortium led by Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Air. The airline said failure to approve a sale would mean investors were unlikely to get anything for their shares. The airline's board agreed the \u00a32.2m sale to Connect Airways group last month, but the deal needs investor approval at a meeting on 4 March.  Flybe acknowledged the offer of 1 penny per share was \"disappointingly low\". However, it said it was the only rescue plan on the table.  In a statement on Thursday, Flybe said: \"If the [sale] scheme is not approved, the Flybe directors intend to take steps to wind-up the company and shareholders are likely to receive no value for their shares in Flybe.\"  Based in Exeter, Flybe carries about eight million passengers a year from airports such as Southampton, Cardiff and Aberdeen, to the UK and Europe. It put itself up for sale last November, following a profits warning the previous month. Flybe said it had been \"hampered by the challenging market environment\".  \"Ongoing fuel and currency impacts presented particularly significant headwinds for Flybe as did the rapid and significant tightening on Flybe's liquidity from the card acquirer market.\"  In addition, it said, the \"general economic outlook and conditions had impacted the business leading to a further weakening in consumer demand, affecting cash, revenues and profit adversely\". It agreed to sell the parent company to Connect on 11 January.  However, on 15 January, to avoid the airline going into administration the Flybe board entered into a separate agreement to sell the operating subsidiaries - the airline and the website - to Connect Airways for \u00a32.8m. That sale is expected to be competed by 22 February, and does not require shareholder approval.  Once it is complete, however, the parent company will not have any subsidiaries or assets other than cash from the sale of the operating assets. The directors said it was not anticipated that after meeting costs there will be \"any remaining funds available for distribution to Flybe shareholders\". The directors said as a result if the shareholders did not approve the initial sale of the parent company, they would wind up the business.  Therefore, the directors said they \"strongly\" advised Flybe shareholders to vote in favour of the sale of the parent company in order to receive any money at all. ",

            "text": "A Ukrainian Boeing 737-800 with 176 people on board has crashed in Iran, and officials say there is no chance of finding survivors. Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 to Kyiv went down just minutes after taking off from Tehran's airport at 06:12 local time (02:42 GMT). The majority of passengers were from Iran and Canada. Ukraine's Tehran embassy initially blamed engine failure but later removed the statement. It said any comment regarding the cause of Wednesday's accident prior to a commission's inquiry was not official. There was good visibility when the plane went down near Iran's capital, according to the Flightradar24 aviation website. Officials from the airline said the crew were experienced. Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) said the Boeing 737-800 was built in 2016 and had its last scheduled maintenance on Monday.  Hours before the plane came down Iran carried out a ballistic missile attack on two air bases housing US forces in Iraq. There is no evidence that the two incidents were linked. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, warned against \"speculation or unchecked theories regarding the catastrophe\" until official reports were ready. Iranian media blamed technical problems and quoted an aviation official who said no emergency had been declared.  In a sign of the potential difficulties facing crash investigators, the head of Iran's civil aviation organisation was quoted as saying the Ukrainian plane's \"black boxes\" - the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder - had been found but would not be handed over, either to Boeing or the Americans. Ali Abedzadeh said \"terrorism\" had played no role in the crash, Iran's conservative Mehr news agency reported.  He added that at this stage it was unclear who would analyse the black boxes. Another Iranian official, Qasem Biniaz, blamed an engine fire. \"Had the accident happened due to a missile strike, the plane would have exploded in the air,\" he told the IRNA news agency. Normally, the US National Transportation Safety Board would have a role to play in any international investigations involving US-made Boeings. But the board must act with permission and in accordance with legislation of the foreign country concerned. Video circulating on social media appeared to show the last few seconds of the plane's flight.  It can be seen streaking across the night sky while on fire before it quickly loses height. There is an initial explosion close to the ground and then a final blast that lights up the area. Debris and engine parts from the Boeing 737-800 NG plane were found some 10km (6 miles) from Tehran's Imam Khomeini airport to the west of the capital, and rescue workers with face masks searched the wreckage for victims. Throughout the morning, Red Crescent workers laid out a long line of body bags. Personal effects such as children's books, clothes and shoes lay strewn around the area, alongside the mangled debris of the plane. The head of Red Crescent said that it was \"impossible\" for anyone to have survived the crash. All direct flights between Ukraine and Iran were suspended, while a number of airlines announced that they were avoiding both Iranian and Iraqi airspace.  Air France and KLM said they would use alternative routes while Lufthansa said it was also cancelling its daily flight to Tehran. Qantas, Air India, Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines were among other airlines taking action. Among the victims were 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians including all nine crew, 10 Swedes, four Afghans, three Britons and three Germans, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said. Fifteen of the dead were children. Ukrainian officials said that 169 people had bought tickets for the flight but two had not boarded the plane. The German government later said \"we currently have no knowledge that German citizens are among the victims of the plane crash in Iran\". It was unclear why such a large number of Canadians were on board, however the airline provides relatively inexpensive flights via Kyiv to Toronto. Some of the Canadians were thought to be students returning at the end of the school holidays. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was \"shocked and saddened\" by the news of the crash, offering \"deepest condolences to those who have lost family, friends, and loved ones in this tragedy\". Sweden's foreign ministry said its embassy in Tehran was seeking further information about the crash.  Iran's head of emergency operations said 147 of the victims were Iranian. That would suggest that 65 of the foreign nationals had dual nationalities. The Ukrainian airline gave a helpline number for further information about passengers: +38-044-581-50-19. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was cutting short a trip to Oman and flying back to Kyiv. \"My sincere condolences to the relatives and friends of all passengers and crew,\" he said in a statement. The airline named the nine crew killed in the crash, including three pilots and six flight attendants.  Among those who died was Valeriia Ovcharuk, a 28-year-old who posted pictures on social media of several of the destinations she had visited with the airline, from Lithuania to Bangkok and Beijing. There was reportedly no sign of any problems with the plane before take-off and the airline's president said it had an \"excellent, reliable crew\". UIA has never had a fatal crash before. Mr Zelensky said Ukraine's entire civil aviation fleet would be checked for airworthiness and criminal proceedings would be opened into the disaster. This type of Boeing is one of the most widely-used commercial airliners in the world. Aviation safety analyst Todd Curtis told the BBC: \"The airplane was heavily fragmented which means either there was an intense impact on the ground or something happened in the sky.\" There are several thousand Boeing 737-800s in operation around the world which have completed tens of millions of flights. They have been involved in 10 incidents, including this crash, where at least one passenger was killed, Mr Curtis said.  The plane's engines are made by French-US firm CFM, owned by General Electric and France's Safran. Mr Curtis said Iranian, Ukrainian, US and French authorities would all be involved in the investigation, but it was unclear how they would work together. Iran is currently under US sanctions and there are severe tensions between the two countries.  Boeing expressed its condolences to everyone involved. Todd Curtis said there nothing at this stage pointed to any particular cause. \"One cannot discount the possibility that something outside the aircraft, a mid-air collision or some other issue, may have been involved.\" Flight data from the Ukrainian Airlines Boeing 737-800 is openly available online. It shows that the plane climbed normally after taking-off from Tehran.  It reached nearly 8,000ft (2,400m) before the aircraft's data suddenly disappears.  This is unusual and would suggest some type of catastrophic incident on board the plane. We have no evidence at this stage to tell us what caused the incident.  According to a former air crash investigator, any suggestion of engine failure feels premature. This possibility can't be ruled out at this early stage but an airliner such as the Boeing 737-800 is designed to keep flying if there is an engine failure.  Plus, if there was a failure then we would normally expect the flight data to show the plane's climb becoming less steep.",

            "title": "TWA85: 'The world's longest and most spectacular hijacking'",
            "text": "At the high point of the 1960s spate of hijackings, a plane was held up on average once every six days in the United States. Fifty years ago this week, Raffaele Minichiello was responsible for the \"longest and most spectacular\" of them, as one report described it at the time. Could those on board ever forgive him? 21 August 1962 Under the hills of southern Italy, a little north-east of Naples, a fault ruptured and the earth began shaking. Those living on the surface, in one of the most earthquake-prone parts of Europe, were used to this. The 6.1-magnitude quake in the early evening was enough to frighten everyone, but it was the two powerful aftershocks that did the most damage. Twenty kilometres up from the epicentre and a few hundred metres north was where the Minichiello family lived, including 12-year-old Raffaele. By the time the third earthquake had subsided, their village of Melito Irpino was uninhabitable. The Minichiello family were left with nothing, Raffaele would later recall, and no-one in authority came to help. The damage was such that almost the entire village was evacuated, razed and rebuilt. Many families would return, but the Minichiellos decided to move to the US for a better life. What Raffaele Minichiello found instead was war, trauma and notoriety.  01:30;  31 October 1969 Dressed in camouflage, Raffaele Minichiello stepped on to the plane, a $15.50 ticket from Los Angeles to San Francisco in his hand. This was the last stop on Trans World Airlines flight 85's journey across the US, which had started several hours earlier in Baltimore before calling at St Louis and Kansas City. The crew of three in the cockpit were helped by four young female flight attendants, most of whom had been in the job for only a few months. The most experienced was Charlene Delmonico, a bob-haired 23-year-old from Missouri who had been flying with the airline for three years. Delmonico had swapped shifts to fly on TWA85 as she wanted Halloween night free. Before leaving Kansas City, captain Donald Cook, 31, had informed the flight attendants of a change in the usual practice: if they wanted to enter the cockpit, they were to ring a bell outside the door, and not knock. The flight landed in Los Angeles late at night. Passengers disembarked and others, bleary-eyed, joined the short night flight to San Francisco. The lights were dimmed so that those who had stayed on board could continue sleeping. The flight attendants checked the passengers' tickets when they boarded quietly, but Delmonico paid particular attention to one of the new arrivals, especially his bag. The tanned young man in camouflage, his wavy brown hair flattened, was nervous but polite as he boarded. A thin container protruded from his backpack. Delmonico moved towards the first-class compartment, where her colleagues Tanya Novacoff and Roberta Johnson were guiding passengers to their seats. \"What was that thing sticking out of the young man's backpack?\" Delmonico asked them. The answer - a fishing rod - calmed her fears and she returned to the back of the plane. The flight was far from busy. With only 40 passengers on board, there was room for everyone to spread out and seek their own row in which to sleep. Among them were the five mop-topped members of the sunshine pop group Harpers Bizarre, exhausted after a strange concert in Pasadena that night that had been temporarily halted by a man screaming from the balcony of the auditorium. It had been two years since the band's biggest hit, an adaptation of Simon & Garfunkel's The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy), but they would hit the peak of their fame just a few hours later. Singer-guitarist Dick Scoppettone and drummer John Petersen settled on the left-hand side of the plane and, relaxing into their seats, they lit cigarettes. At 01:30 on Friday, 31 October 1969, TWA flight 85 left Los Angeles for San Francisco. Fifteen minutes into the flight, the hijack began. Anyone sleeping peacefully would have had their rest disturbed on take-off. To boost the plane's thrust, the Boeing 707 injected water into the engines as it took off, earning it the industry nickname the Water Wagon. The effect inside the plane was violent and noisy, producing an ominous deep rumble. Darkness fell inside the plane as the flight attendants turned the lights almost all the way down. As silence settled, Charlene Delmonico began tidying the galley in the back of the plane with Tracey Coleman, a 21-year-old languages graduate who had joined TWA only five months earlier. The nervous passenger in camouflage from earlier stepped into the galley and stood alongside them. He had an M1 rifle in his hand. Delmonico, calm and professional, responded simply: \"You're not supposed to have that.\" He responded by handing her a 7.62mm bullet to prove the rifle was loaded, and ordered her to lead him to the cockpit to show it to the crew. Dick Scoppettone was drifting off to sleep but the movement further down the aisle roused him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Delmonico being followed by a man who was pointing a rifle at her back. His bandmate John Petersen turned to him from a few rows in front and stared wide-eyed. \"Is this really happening?\" Towards the back of the plane, one of the passengers, Jim Findlay, got up to confront Minichiello. The hijacker turned around. He shouted to Delmonico: \"Halt!\" This man is a soldier, Delmonico thought. With Findlay ordered back to his seat, Delmonico and Minichiello moved up the cabin again. She pushed the curtain aside to enter the first-class compartment, her knees buckling under the nerves, and alerted the two flight attendants ahead of her: \"There's a man behind me with a gun.\" They both moved quickly out of the way. Some of the passengers heard Minichiello shout at Delmonico as he became more and more agitated next to the cockpit door. For the most part he was polite, respectful and came across, in her words, as \"a nice clean-cut kid\", but by now paranoia was getting the better of him. Delmonico remembered the captain's instruction: don't knock to enter, ring the bell instead. But Minichiello, afraid he was being tricked, refused to let her do this. She knocked instead, and hoped this would alert the crew. The door opened, and Delmonico told the wary crew there was a man with a gun behind her. Minichiello stepped inside and pointed the rifle at each of the three men inside the cockpit: captain Cook, first officer Wenzel Williams and flight engineer Lloyd Hollrah. Minichiello appeared to be well trained and well armed, Williams thought. He knew what he wanted from the crew, and was determined to get it. After Delmonico had stepped out of the cockpit, Minichiello turned to the crew and said in heavily accented English: \"Turn towards New York.\" The unusual sight of a man walking through the plane with a gun had not gone unnoticed by those passengers who were still awake. The members of Harpers Bizarre had all raced to sit next to one another within seconds of the gunman passing by. Their strange evening had just got stranger. They speculated how the man might have been able to sneak a rifle on to the plane. Where could they be going? Hong Kong, maybe? They'd never been to Hong Kong, that could be fun. Nearby, Judi Provance's training kicked in. An off-duty TWA flight attendant, she was returning home to San Francisco after eight days on rota flying around Asia. Every year, she and TWA staff would undertake training in how to respond during emergencies, including hijackings. The main lesson they had been taught was to stay calm. Another was to not fall in love with the hijacker - it was easy, they had been told, for hijackers to elicit sympathy from the crew. Provance quietly mentioned to those around her that she had seen someone walking down the aisle with a gun. She had been taught not to cause panic, and to help manage the situation calmly. Jim Findlay, the man who had previously tried to intervene, was a TWA pilot \"deadheading\" on board as a passenger. He found the hijacker's bags and went through them to look for clues to his identity, and to make sure no more weapons were on board. Only later did the passengers find rifle magazines full of bullets. Captain Cook's voice came over the loudspeaker. \"We have a very nervous young man up here and we are going to take him wherever he wants to go.\" As the flight moved further and further from San Francisco, other messages were communicated to the passengers, or started spreading among them: they were heading to Italy, Denver, Cairo, Cuba. The crew inside the cockpit feared for their lives, but some of the passengers felt they were part of an adventure. An odd one, but an adventure nevertheless. It was only natural that people on board TWA85 thought they might be heading to Cuba. It had long been hijackers' destination of choice.  From the early 1960s, a number of Americans disillusioned with their homeland and entranced by the promise of a communist ideal had fled to Cuba following Fidel Castro's revolution. As American planes did not normally fly to the island, hijacking gave people the means of getting there. And by accepting hijackers from the US, Castro could embarrass and annoy his enemy while demanding money to return the planes. A three-month period in 1961 heralded the start of the hijacking phenomenon. On 1 May, Antulio Ramirez Ortiz boarded a National Airlines flight from Miami under a false name, and seized control of the plane by threatening the captain with a steak knife. He demanded to be flown to Cuba, where he wanted to warn Castro of a plot to kill him that had been wholly imagined by Ramirez. Two more hijackings followed over the following two months, and the next 11 years saw 159 commercial flights hijacked in the United States, Brendan I Koerner writes in his book The Skies Belong To Us: Love and Terror in the Golden Age of Hijacking. Hijackings that ended in Cuba were so common, he writes, that at one point US airline captains were given maps of the Caribbean and Spanish-language guides in case they had to unexpectedly fly to Havana. A direct phone line was set up between Florida air traffic controllers and Cuba. And there was even a suggestion that a replica of Havana's airport be built in Florida, to fool hijackers into thinking they had reached Cuba. The hijackings were able to happen because of a lack of security at airports. There was simply no need to check passengers' luggage because no-one had ever caused any trouble, until the hijackings began. For years after that, the airline industry resisted introducing checks because they feared it would ruin the passenger experience and slow down the check-in process. \"We lived in a different world,\" Jon Proctor, a gate agent with TWA at Los Angeles International Airport in the 1960s, told the BBC. \"People didn't blow up airliners. If anything, they might hijack an airliner and want to go to Cuba, but they didn't try to blow up an airliner.\" It would later emerge that Raffaele Minichiello had disassembled his rifle and carried it on to TWA85 in a tube, before putting the gun back together in the plane's bathroom. Taking it on board would have been \"very easy\", Proctor said. Gate agents would only have weighed his backpack and not checked it. By the time TWA85 was held up, there had already been 54 hijackings in the US in 1969, the Associated Press reported at the time, at a rate of one every six days. But no-one had ever hijacked a plane in the US and taken it to another continent. The crew were getting mixed messages from their jittery passenger: he wanted to go to New York, or maybe Rome. If their destination was to be New York, that would be a problem: they had enough fuel to fly only to San Francisco, so would have to stop for more. And if they were heading for Rome, there would be an even bigger obstacle: nobody on board was qualified to fly internationally. Eventually, captain Cook was allowed into the cabin to talk to the passengers. \"If you've made any plans in San Francisco,\" he said, \"don't plan on keeping them. Because you're going to New York.\" After some negotiation, Minichiello agreed to let the captain land in Denver to take on enough fuel to reach the east coast. While over Colorado, Cook alerted air traffic control for the first time that the plane had been hijacked. The plans soon changed: Minichiello would let the 39 other passengers get off in Denver, but he insisted that one of the flight attendants stay on board. A small debate broke out about who should stay. The hijacker's preference was Delmonico, whom he had led to the cockpit at gunpoint. Cook wanted Roberta Johnson, whom he knew best of all four attendants. As Delmonico began writing a manifest of all passengers on board, Tracey Coleman went up to the cockpit with coffee for the crew. When she stepped back out, she insisted to Delmonico: \"I'm gonna go.\" Coleman had a boyfriend in New York, she said, and could go and see him. But Delmonico knew New York would not be the final destination. \"You're not going to stay in New York,\" she told Coleman. \"He can't stay there, he'll be arrested if he gets out there. He's going somewhere else - I don't know where, but he's going somewhere else.\" Coleman, in an interview with TWA Skyliner magazine after the hijacking, said she knew what was at stake. \"It wasn't because I just wanted to go along for the ride,\" she said. \"But it was feared that if one of the stewardesses didn't stay aboard, he may not let the passengers off in Denver.\" Minichiello had demanded that the lights at Denver's Stapleton International Airport be turned off as the plane landed. He didn't want any surprises, and promised to release the passengers only if there was no trouble. His nerves apparently calming, the hijacker proved unexpectedly accommodating. While he was exiting, Jim Findlay, the deadheading TWA pilot, realised he had left behind a Halloween outfit he had bought in Hong Kong. Findlay asked Minichiello if he could return to the back of the plane to retrieve it. He politely replied: \"Sure.\" As the passengers filed off the plane in cold, foggy weather with sunrise still two hours away, they were met by an unsmiling FBI agent in an overcoat. The relief among those allowed to leave was clear, and they were led down a darkened corridor through the terminal. At the end was a room swarming with FBI agents, who had rushed to the airport at short notice and were waiting to take statements from the 39 passengers and three flight attendants. The members of Harpers Bizarre remembered what their manager had once told them: if they were ever involved in any trouble, anything at all, they were to call him first, even before they got to a police station or hospital. As soon as they reached the terminal, they did just that, even though it was the middle of the night where he lived. The tactic paid off. When they had finished giving their statements, they stepped into another room and were greeted by the flash of camera bulbs, reporters shouting the band's name, and phones ringing as news outlets around the US hoped to hear their story. \"It was the best publicity we ever had, by a mile,\" Dick Scoppettone told the BBC. The assembled photographers captured tired passengers slumped against walls. Other passengers smiled, bemused, as they recounted what had happened. The three flight attendants gave statements to the FBI, and Charlene Delmonico's ran to 13 handwritten pages. After a day of interviews, all the flight attendants got home to Kansas City late in the evening, as TV channels kept viewers updated as the unlikely hijack continued. Delmonico settled in at home after more than a day without sleep. Late in the evening, her telephone rang. It was the FBI, could they come around to see her? They arrived at 23:00 and handed her a photo. The image of Raffaele Minichiello looked back at her. \"Yes, that's him,\" she said. It was a face she would encounter again almost 40 years later. The three-hour flight from Denver passed peacefully. Minichiello, stretched out in first class with the gun at his side, had calmed down. He poured himself an unusual cocktail from two miniature bottles - Canadian Club whisky and gin. Only five people remained on board TWA85 - captain Cook, first officer Wenzel Williams, flight engineer Lloyd Hollrah, flight attendant Tracey Coleman and the hijacker himself. The plane landed at John F Kennedy airport late in the morning, and was parked as far from the terminals as possible. The order from the cockpit, like in Denver, was for as few people as possible to approach the plane. But the FBI was ready, and keen to stop the hijacker before he set a dangerous precedent and took a domestic flight to another continent. Close to 100 agents were waiting for TWA85, many disguised as mechanics hoping to sneak on board. Within minutes of the landing, as refuelling was about to take place, the FBI started approaching the plane. Through the cockpit window, Cook spoke to one agent who wanted a reluctant Minichiello to come closer to the window to speak to them. \"Raffaele was running up and down the aisles to make sure they weren't trying to sneak in the airplane,\" Wenzel Williams told the BBC 50 years on. \"He felt he would be shot if he came to the window.\" The captain, one eye on his passenger, warned the agents to stay away from the plane. Soon afterwards, a shot rang out. The accepted version of events now is that Minichiello did not intend to shoot. In his agitated state, just outside the cockpit door, he is thought to have nudged the trigger of his rifle with his finger. The bullet pierced the ceiling and glanced off an oxygen tank, but did not penetrate it or the plane's fuselage. Had it damaged the fuselage, the plane would not have been able to fly on. Had it pierced the oxygen tank and caused an explosion, there might not have been a plane, or crew, left to fly. Even though the shot had apparently been fired by accident, it sent shivers through the crew and they were reminded that their lives were at stake. Captain Cook - who was sure the rifle had been fired on purpose - shouted at the agents through the window, chastising them and telling them the plane was leaving immediately, without refuelling. Two TWA captains of 24 years' experience who were allowed to fly internationally, Billy Williams and Richard Hastings, pushed their way through the FBI agents and onto the plane. Everyone else stayed on board. \"The FBI plan was damned near a prescription for getting the entire crew killed,\" Cook later told the New York Times.  \"We sat with that boy for six hours and had seen him go from practically a raving maniac to a fairly complacent and intelligent young man with a sense of humour, and then these idiots... irresponsibly made up their own minds about how to handle this boy on the basis of no information, and the good faith we had built up for almost six hours was completely destroyed.\" The two new pilots, who were in no mood to humour the hijacker, took charge of the plane. Minichiello ordered everyone else to stay inside the cockpit with their hands on their heads. The plane took off quickly, with nowhere near enough fuel on board to reach its intended destination: Rome. Twenty minutes after the plane had left New York with a bullet lodged in its roof, the tension on board had eased, thanks largely to Cook convincing Minichiello that the crew had nothing to do with the chaos at Kennedy airport. The events there meant the plane had been unable to refuel, so within the hour, TWA85 landed in the north-eastern corner of the US in Bangor, Maine, where it took on enough fuel to cross the Atlantic. By now, in the early afternoon, the story of the hijacking and the drama in New York had gained the full attention of the American media. Photographers and reporters turned out en masse at Bangor's airport terminal. Close to 75 police officers ensured the press stayed as far as possible from the plane in case the gunman was provoked again. Hundreds of people had driven to the airport to get a glimpse of the action, but were kept half a mile away from the terminal. From the plane, the hijacker spotted two people watching from a nearby building. Cook, eager to leave, radioed the control tower: \"You had better hurry. He says he is going to start shooting at that building unless they get a move on.\" The two men quickly left. On board, as the plane headed towards international airspace, a sense of solidarity had begun to develop among those who had been together for more than nine hours. But under the surface, even as they tried to keep the hijacker happy, the crew continued to fear for their lives. With the new pilots on board, Cook went to sit with Minichiello in the first-class compartment, where they swapped stories. Cook spoke of his time as an air traffic controller with the US Air Force. The rifle rested between them, but at no point did the crew try to take it, mostly out of concern over how the hijacker might react. Minichiello repeatedly asked Cook if he was married. He replied that he was, despite being a bachelor. \"That seemed wiser,\" Cook told the New York Times later. He had assumed a jittery man with a gun would be less likely to harm married crew. \"He asked how many kids I had and I said one. Then he asked about the other members of the crew and I said: 'Yeah, all of them are married.'\" In fact, only one of the four original crew members was married. Tracey Coleman, too, spent time chatting to Minichiello during the transatlantic trip, the first time she had left the United States or flown for longer than four hours. He taught her card games including solitaire and he was \"a very easy fellow to talk to\", she would later recall. He talked about his family moving to the US and, intriguingly, said he had \"had a little military trouble after coming back to the States and just wanted to go home to Italy\", Coleman later told an airline industry magazine. She slept a little during the six-hour flight from Bangor to Shannon, on Ireland's west coast, where TWA85 refuelled once more in the middle of the night. Few others on board were able to sleep. \"We were too keyed up for that,\" Wenzel Williams recalled. The only food on board was a handful of cupcakes left on the original flight from Baltimore to Los Angeles. \"Food wasn't exactly much of an issue,\" Williams told the BBC. \"Having a gun pointed at us a good bit of the time kept most other issues at bay.\" As TWA85 crossed time zones on its approach to Ireland, and 31 October became 1 November, Minichiello turned 20. No-one celebrated. Half an hour after landing in Ireland, TWA85 was off again, on the final stretch of its 6,900-mile (11,000km) journey to Rome.  TWA85 circled Rome's Fiumicino airport early in the morning. Minichiello had one more demand: the plane was to be parked far from the terminal and he was to be met by an unarmed police official. The hijack was nearing its end, 18-and-a-half hours after it had started over the skies of central California. It was, the New York Times reported at the time, \"the world's longest and most spectacular hijacking\". In the last few minutes of the flight, Williams said, the hijacker offered to drive the crew to a hotel once they had landed, an offer they politely declined. Minichiello also feared the crew would be punished for not having stolen his gun when they had the opportunity. \"I've given you guys an awful lot of trouble,\" he told Cook. \"That's all right,\" the captain replied. \"We don't take it personally.\" At the airport, shortly after 05:00, a lone Alfa Romeo approached the plane. Out of it emerged Pietro Guli, a deputy customs official who had volunteered to meet the hijacker. He walked up the steps to the plane with his hands up, and Minichiello emerged to meet him. \"So long, Don,\" the hijacker told the captain as he left. \"I'm sorry I caused you all this trouble.\" Minichiello noted Cook's address in Kansas City so he could later write to him and explain what had happened after they separated. The two men walked down the steps towards the car, Minichiello still holding his rifle, and the six people on board felt \"total relief\", according to first officer Wenzel Williams. They were free again. But they all hoped the next stage of the hijacking would end safely, for both Minichiello and his new hostage. After Los Angeles, Denver, New York, Bangor, Shannon and Rome, there was only one destination now. \"Take me to Naples,\" Minichiello ordered Pietro Guli. He was heading home. Four police cars trailed the Alfa Romeo and the officers' voices crackled over the hostage's radio. Minichiello, sitting in the back seat, switched off the radio and gave his hostage directions where to go. In the countryside about six miles from the centre of Rome, having somehow evaded the pursuing cars, the Alfa Romeo travelled down lanes that became ever more narrow. Eventually it reached a dead end and both men stepped out of the car. Realising he had few options left, Minichiello sprinted away in panic. Twenty-three hours after TWA85 left Los Angeles, Minichiello's journey came to an end. It did so only because of the publicity the hijacking had generated. Over five hours in the hills around Rome, hundreds of police officers, some with dogs and helicopters, led the search for the hijacker. But in the end, he was found by a priest. Saturday, 1 November was All Saints Day, and the Sanctuary of Divine Love was full for morning Mass. Among the well-dressed congregation, the young man in his vest and undershorts stood out. Minichiello had sought shelter in the church after shedding his military clothes and stashing his gun in a barn. But his face was now famous and the vice-rector, Don Pasquale Silla, recognised him. When the police finally surrounded Minichiello outside the church, he expressed bemusement - interpreted by reporters as the arrogance of a young criminal - that his countrymen might want to detain him. \"Pais\u00e0 [my people], why are you arresting me?\" he asked. He employed the same tone hours later while speaking to reporters, his hands free of cuffs, after a brief interrogation in a Rome police station. \"Why did you do it?\" one reporter asked. \"Why did I do it?\" he replied. \"I don't know.\" When another asked him about the hijacked plane, he replied in a perplexed tone: \"What plane? I don't know what you're talking about.\" But in another interview, he revealed the real reasons for the hijack. As the news of Minichiello's arrest spread around the world later that day, Otis Turner sat down for breakfast in the mess of his Marine barracks in California. The television in the corner was relaying the details of the daring hijack and the manhunt in the Italian countryside. \"Then they flashed up Raffaele's picture,\" Turner told the BBC. \"I was just floored, absolutely floored.\" The two men had served in the same platoon in Vietnam. \"I was confused at first,\" Turner said, \"but when I really got to thinking about it, I knew he had had some issues and it all came together.\" When the hijacking happened, it was four-and-a-half years since US combat forces had first landed in Vietnam and the fall of Saigon was still more than five years away. The US would leave Vietnam having completely failed in its mission, leaving more than 58,000 American service personnel and millions of Vietnamese - both combatants and civilians - dead. Opposition in the US to the war was at its peak in late 1969. An estimated two million people across the US had taken part in the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam - reported as the biggest demonstration in American history - two weeks before the hijacking. The lottery drafting young Americans to fight was still a month away from being enforced, but many thousands of young men had already volunteered, believing back then that the cause - to fight the communists of North Vietnam - was valid. Raffaele Minichiello was one of those who volunteered. In May 1967, the 17 year old left his home in Seattle, to where he and his family had moved after the earthquake in their Italian homeland in 1962. He travelled to San Diego to enlist in the Marine Corps, and for those who knew him - a little stubborn, a little gung-ho - this did not come as a surprise. Minichiello barely spoke English, and had been teased for his thick Neapolitan accent by his classmates before dropping out of school altogether. Doing so had brought an end to his ambitions of being a commercial pilot. But he was proud of his adopted country, and was willing to fight for it in the hope it would make him a naturalised American citizen. Otis Turner arrived in Vietnam at about the same time as Minichiello, and they served in different squads in the same Marine platoon. They were \"grunts\" - the men dropped on to the jungle-cloaked hills of the front line for a few months at a time to take the fight to the communist forces. \"Anybody will tell you: the grunts had the toughest job in the Marine Corps,\" Turner, now living in Iowa, said. \"We were in 120-degree (49C) weather, in monsoon season. It was terrible.\" In 2019, Turner looks back with some shame at what they were ordered to do, and how they complied. Their mission was brutally simple. \"From the time we joined the Marine Corps, we were basically all about kill, kill, kill,\" he said. \"That's all they wanted us to do. They drilled that into us from the beginning.\" Minichiello's role brought him into firefights that killed close friends, and led him to save others who were in danger. He was awarded the Cross of Gallantry, which was given out by the government of South Vietnam to those who had displayed heroic conduct in the war. Adjusting to daily life back in the US proved impossible. \"There was no staging area to regroup or to get your mind and body back working as one unit,\" Turner told the BBC. \"There was no period there just to break it all down and think about what you had just done, to see a professional. \"There were a lot of sick people, confused people. Raffaele was in some state. All of us were confused when we left Vietnam.\" Turner said most members of his and Minichiello's platoon - including himself - went on to be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The US Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that up to 30% of all those who served in Vietnam have suffered PTSD at some point in their lives - about 810,000 people. Raffaele Minichiello would not be diagnosed until 2008. He remains ineligible for treatment having received a \"less than honourable\" discharge by the military, a decision his platoon is still campaigning to reverse. Tracked down by reporters near Naples, Minichiello's father - who was by then suffering from terminal cancer and had returned to Italy - knew immediately what had caused his son to hijack the plane. \"The war must have provoked a state of shock in his mind,\" Luigi Minichiello said. \"Before that, he was always sane.\" He vowed to clip him around the ear when he next saw him. Another reason for the hijacking soon emerged. While in Vietnam, Minichiello had been sending money to a Marines savings fund. He had collected $800, but when he returned to base in Camp Pendleton, California, he noticed there was only $600 in his account. It was not enough to pay for a visit to Italy to see his dying father. Minichiello raised his concerns with his superiors, and insisted he be given the $200 he felt he was owed. His superiors didn't listen, and dismissed his complaint. And so Minichiello took matters into his own hands, albeit clumsily. One night, he broke into the store on the base to steal $200 of goods. Unfortunately for him, he did so after drinking eight beers and fell asleep inside the store. He was caught the next morning. The day before he hijacked TWA85, he had been due to appear before a court martial in Camp Pendleton but, fearing prison, he went awol and travelled up to Los Angeles. With him, he took a Chinese rifle he had registered as a war trophy in Vietnam. Against the odds, Minichiello became a folk hero in Italy, where he was portrayed not as a troubled gunman who had threatened a planeload of passengers, but as a fresh-faced Italian boy who would do anything to return to the motherland. He faced trial in Italy - the authorities there insisted on this within hours of his arrest - and would not face extradition to the US, where he could have faced the death penalty. At his trial, his lawyer Giuseppe Sotgiu portrayed Minichiello as the poor victim - the poor Italian victim - of an unconscionable foreign war. \"I am sure that Italian judges will understand and forgive an act born from a civilisation of aircraft and war violence, a civilisation which overwhelmed this uncultured peasant.\" He was prosecuted in Italy only for crimes committed in Italian airspace, and sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison. That sentence was quickly reduced on appeal, and he was released on 1 May 1971. Wearing a brown suit, the 21 year old stepped out of the Queen of Heaven prison near the Vatican to face crowds of photographers and cameramen. Occasionally overawed by the attention and breaking into a smile that flitted from nervousness to cockiness, he stopped to speak to reporters. \"Are you sorry for what you did?\" one asked. \"Why should I be?\" he replied, grinning. But after that, an array of prospects came to nothing. A nude modelling career never took off, and a promise by a film producer to turn Minichiello into a Spaghetti Western star was never kept. For years, rumours swirled that the character John Rambo was based on Minichiello - after all, Rambo was a decorated but misunderstood Vietnam veteran who had lost the plot - but the man who created Rambo has since dismissed the suggestion. In the years after prison, Minichiello settled in Rome where he worked as a bartender. He married the bar owner's daughter, Cinzia, with whom he had a son. At one point he also owned a pizza restaurant named Hijacking. 23 November 1980 The earthquake that had destroyed Raffaele Minichiello's hometown in 1962 was just a precursor. Eighteen years later, a magnitude-6.9 earthquake struck southern Italy, its epicentre barely 20 miles from the one in 1962. This was the most powerful earthquake to strike Italy in 70 years, and it caused enormous damage across the Irpinia region. Up to 4,690 people were killed and 20,000 homes - many of them in a weakened state after the 1962 quake - were destroyed. Soon afterwards, Italians began arriving in large groups to the region east of Naples to distribute aid. Among them was Raffaele Minichiello. The 31 year old was still living in Rome at the time, but had felt compelled to make the 300-mile trip home three times in only two weeks to deliver aid. \"I know all about earthquakes in Irpinia,\" he told an interviewer from People magazine in December 1980. \"That is where I was born, and that is where all my troubles began.\" His distrust of authority, fostered during his time in the Marines, had stayed with him. \"I mistrust institutions, so I give help personally,\" he said. \"I know all about people who don't keep their promises.\" Minichiello was recognised among the snowy ruins of Irpinia, but he was not quite the minor celebrity he had been when TWA85 landed in Rome 11 years earlier.  At that time, his image - slick curled hair, cigarette in his right hand, casual smirk on his face - had been on the front covers of magazines around the world. In the post-earthquake ruins, a more repentant Minichiello began to emerge. \"I'm very different now to who I was,\" he said. \"I'm sorry for what I did to those people on the plane.\" Minichiello's redemption did not come with the Irpinia earthquake. And his story could have ended very differently had his plan for another attack come to fruition, although this plan was much more poorly thought-out than his hijack. In February 1985, Cinzia was pregnant with the couple's second child. After being admitted to hospital in labour, she and her newborn son died as a result of medical malpractice. Minichiello, feeling angry and let down by the authorities again, knew what he would do. He would target a prominent medical conference outside Rome, and draw attention to the negligence that had cost his wife and son their lives. He arranged, via an acquaintance, to acquire guns with which he would launch a violent revenge attack. While he plotted, Minichiello struck up a friendship with a young colleague, Tony, who sensed his distress. Tony introduced him to the Bible and read him passages out loud. Minichiello listened and, over time, decided to devote his life to God. He called off his attack. In 1999, Minichiello decided to return to the United States for the first time since the hijack. He had learned earlier that year that there were no outstanding criminal charges against him in the US, but his decision to abscond was not entirely without consequence. Because Minichiello had fled a court martial, he was given what is known as an \"other than honourable discharge\" by the Marines. His former platoon comrades have been fighting to get this reduced to a general discharge, to reflect his service in Vietnam, but they remain unsuccessful to this day. \"Raffaele was a great Marine, a decorated Marine,\" fellow platoon member Otis Turner told the BBC. \"He was always the guy right out front. He would volunteer for everything. He has saved lives. What he did for this country, his part in Vietnam... you just don't throw somebody to the side like that.\" As his platoon worked to clear his name, Minichiello asked them to help with another mission: finding those who were on board TWA85, so he could apologise. 8 August 2009 By the summer of 2009, Charlene Delmonico had been retired for more than eight years after spending her whole 35-year career as a flight attendant with TWA. Within a year of her retirement in January 2001, the airline no longer existed after falling into bankruptcy and being taken over by American Airlines. Out of the blue, Delmonico received an invitation. Would she be willing to meet the man who had once held her up at gunpoint? The invitation had come from Otis Turner and other members of Raffaele's platoon. \"I thought the idea was kind of crazy,\" Turner said. \"But I got thinking and I thought: why not try?\" Delmonico's first reaction to the invitation was shock. The hijacking had defined her life, and reshaped it. Why should she meet the man who had once put a gun against her back? Her second reaction, as a churchgoer, was different. \"I was kind of surprised,\" she told the BBC. \"And I had a strange feeling. This was something that had happened that was very scary and nerve-wracking - it really did get to me. \"Then I thought: we are taught to forgive. But I didn't know how I would receive him.\" In August 2009, Delmonico travelled the almost 150 miles south from her home to Branson, Missouri, where Minichiello and his former platoon were holding a reunion. There she met Wenzel Williams, the first officer on TWA85, who was the only other person to accept the offer to meet Minichiello. Captain Cook had refused, a gesture that hurt the one-time hijacker who believed he had developed a bond with the captain as they had sat chatting in first class. In a side room at the Clarion Hotel, Williams and Delmonico sat at a round table with the platoon members, minus Minichiello. The former soldiers presented them with a letter, expressing what they hoped could be achieved through the meeting. Their obvious support for Minichiello convinced Delmonico that they felt this was a man worth fighting for. After some time, Minichiello walked in and sat down. The atmosphere remained tense for a while. But as more questions flowed, and Minichiello began to explain what had happened to him, the group grew closer. Minichiello seemed different to Williams - smaller, more softly spoken. He appeared weighed down by his guilt as he relived the hijacking. But his remorse appeared sincere. \"In a way, I got a little closure, saw a different viewpoint,\" Delmonico said. \"I probably felt sorry for him. I thought he was very polite. But he was always polite.\" Before they left, Minichiello handed them both a copy of the New Testament. Inside, he had written: Thank you for your time, so much.

            "title": "EU paid Airbus billions in illegal subsidies, WTO rules",
            "text": "The World Trade Organization (WTO) has ruled that the European Union (EU) failed to comply with requests to end subsidies for Airbus. The US Trade Representative (USTR) said the ruling in the dispute opens the way for placing tariffs on EU goods. The USTR argued that European countries had given $22bn in state aid to Airbus to help launch its A380 and A350 jets, causing losses to US rival Boeing.  The European Commission said most of the disputed support ended in 2011. It said it had \"only a few\" remaining things to do to be compliant and pledged \"swift action\" on those fronts. Tuesday's ruling in favour of the US, which brought the case on behalf of plane-maker Boeing, brings an end to a dispute which began in 2004 over $22bn (\u00a316.3bn) in subsidised European financing for Airbus. The WTO initially found in favour of the US in 2011. The US subsequently complained that the EU and certain member countries were not in compliance with the decision, prompting further wrangling between the two sides.  On Tuesday, the WTO dismissed an appeal by Airbus, saying the European plane maker had failed to fix the harm done to US rival Boeing. Boeing chairman and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said: \"Today's final ruling sends a clear message: disregard for the rules and illegal subsidies are not tolerated.\"  The EU and Airbus argued that the WTO had rejected many of Boeing's initial claims in the suit, limiting the damage. Airbus is also waiting for the outcome of a similar WTO case challenging US government support for Boeing. Airbus chief executive Tom Enders said: \"Of course, today's report is really only half the story - the other half coming out later this year will rule strongly on Boeing's subsidies and we'll see then where the balance lies.\" The decision authorises the US to retaliate against Europe with sanctions, the amount of which would be determined in another WTO decision.  Boeing said it is expecting the \"largest-ever WTO authorisation of retaliatory tariffs\" - which would mean billions of dollars. The retaliation can apply to a range of goods and could come as early as 2019, analysts said. It is rare for a dispute to reach this point. And in the past, the counter-claims over US subsidies for Boeing have kept tensions in check, averting tariffs. But on Tuesday, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer threatened further action.  \"Unless the EU finally takes action to stop breaking the rules and harming US interests, the United States will have to move forward with countermeasures on EU products,\" he said.   The Trump administration may decide to use the decision as leverage to advance other goals, said Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. The White House is currently negotiating with the EU over steel and aluminium tariffs. The US has also expressed frustration over tariffs placed on US goods such as automobiles. \"This has the ability to get complicated,\" Mr Bown said.   The leverage would be short-term, depending on the outcome of the case against the US, he added. The WTO panel has issued a ruling, and both sides have claimed victory. To anyone who has followed the ins and outs of this A380-sized trade dispute over the past 14 years, that will not come as any surprise. Boeing and the US are trumpeting their view that it shows \"disregard for the rules and illegal subsidies is not tolerated\". Meanwhile Airbus is portraying the decision as a \"significant legal success\" because many of Boeing's original complaints have been dismissed along the way. And still grinding through the WTO machinery is a separate complaint the EU has filed against Boeing over allegedly illegal subsidies from Washington State, the US Department of Defense and NASA. The reality is that developing large aircraft requires huge amounts of money - and the best source of that, one way or another, is governments. It isn't only happening in Europe either. Russia and China, for example, are both funding major civil aircraft programmes.  In fact, this dispute looks increasingly like a relic of the days when Boeing and Airbus enjoyed a cosy duopoly, and could afford the distraction of years of complex litigation. ",

            "text": "Passenger aircraft are built in sections around the world then assembled in various locations, so how do you transport huge parts like wings and fuselages? Meet the super-transporters - giant planes for giant jobs. The aircraft being assembled in Hangar L34 at Airbus's Toulouse headquarters is, to put it mildly, an unusual beast. Where most aircraft have slim, elegant fuselages this one is swollen and bloated, ending in a vast curved dome above the cockpit.  Its wings, despite a span of more than 60m (197ft), seem remarkably short and stubby next to that enormous body. Overall, it bears a striking resemblance to a whale - and indeed it is named after one. This is the Airbus Beluga XL, a brand new breed of super-transporter. The company needs aircraft like this to transport major components, such as wings and sections of fuselage, from the factories where they're built to final assembly lines in Germany, France and China. Airbus has highly specialised production centres across Europe, a legacy of the time when it was a consortium of national aerospace businesses.  To allow its supply chain to work effectively, it needs to be able to carry large cargoes from one site to another with minimal delay.  But why not simply build everything in one place to do away with the need for giant transporters? \"Airbus pioneered the system of having centres of excellence around Europe - now around the world,\" says Prof Iain Gray, director of aerospace at Cranfield University.  \"You've got skilled labour, shared investment, and the ability to draw in local expertise - the benefits of a distributed model are well proven.\" Indeed, rival aircraft maker Boeing moved from a more centralised system to Airbus's distributed model, says Prof Gray. Hence the need for super-transporters. Back in the 1970s, that job was done by variants of Super Guppy, a conversion of Boeing's turbo-prop powered C-97 Stratofreighter - itself a development of the Second World War B-29 bomber.  It was replaced in 1995 by a first-generation Beluga, the ST, a twin-engine jet built by Airbus itself. Much bigger than the Super Guppy, it could also be loaded and unloaded far more quickly.  Airbus currently has five Beluga STs in service, flying for thousands of hours each year and often making multiple journeys each day.  But as the aerospace giant itself has grown, so have its needs. One of the main jobs of the Beluga is to fly wings for the new A350 from Broughton in North Wales, where they are manufactured, to Airbus's headquarters in Toulouse, where the aircraft are assembled. \"Airbus's production volumes are massively increasing,\" says Prof Gray, so a longer, wider, taller transport aircraft helps speed up production. \"We can carry more,\" says Bertrand George, head of the Beluga XL programme. \"We can carry two wings at a time, rather than one. So it means for the wing leg of the operation, coming from the UK to Toulouse via Bremen, we double the productivity of the aircraft.\" Despite its remarkable appearance, the Beluga XL is not a wholly new design. In fact, the one being prepared in Hangar L34 began life as a much more conventional machine - an A330-200 freighter. Airbus engineers removed the roof and cockpit and replaced them with a custom-built structure, to create the necessary vast cargo bay. The characteristic Beluga shape was created with the addition of a giant cargo door, allowing the aircraft to be loaded from the front. The Beluga XL will begin test flights later this year, and is due to enter into service in 2019. There are currently two being built, and Airbus intends to make five of them. The existing Belugas will be phased out by 2025. Despite its remarkable size, the Beluga XL will not be the largest super-transporter ploughing through the skies.  Boeing, for example, has its own big beast - the Dreamlifter, which it uses to bring major components of the 787 Dreamliner from supplier factories in Japan and Italy to its final assembly lines in Washington state and South Carolina. If the Airbus looks like a whale, the Boeing most closely resembles a snake that has swallowed a cow.  Based on the 747-400, with an enlarged fuselage, it can actually lift a greater weight than the Beluga. But according to David Learmount, consulting editor of the aviation research company FlightGlobal, such comparisons are not really the point. \"These aircraft are purpose-built to move specific components. There's no point in building them larger than they need to be,\" he says. \"They are each building their aeroplanes for their own purposes.\" Both the Beluga XL and the Dreamlifter are designed to maximise cargo volumes. The converted 747 has the greatest amount of space overall, but the big Beluga has a wider cross section, allowing it to carry bigger components. In fact, in terms of their ability to carry heavy weights, both are put in the shade by military transporters with vast reserves of power - such as the six-engined Antonov An-225. This massive machine was designed during the 1980s to transport the Soviet space shuttle. It is nearly 84m long - 20 metres longer than the XL.  It has a wingspan of 88m and can carry up to 250 tonnes - roughly five times the Airbus's maximum. But its cargo bay is much narrower and lower. In other words, if you want to carry a consignment of tanks, the Antonov would be ideal. But the Beluga XL has been designed for a single purpose - to carry large parts of other planes as efficiently as possible. So while the distributed model for aircraft manufacturing remains in favour, these big beasts of the skies are likely to remain operational for many years to come.",

            "title": "Ryanair cuts back winter flight schedule",
            "text": "Ryanair has announced big cuts to its winter flight schedule, saying it will operate at only 40% of last year's capacity. It said the cuts were in response to increased flight restrictions imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic.  This had led to \"materially\" weaker bookings in November and December. The airline is closing its bases in Cork, Shannon, and Toulouse for the winter, but expects to maintain 65% of routes with reduced frequencies. \"With this greatly reduced winter capacity and load factors of approximately 70%, Ryanair now expects full-year traffic to fall to approximately 38 million guests, although this guidance could be further revised downwards if EU governments continue to mismanage air travel and impose more lockdowns this winter,\" the airline said. Ryanair's group chief executive Michael O'Leary said the airline deeply regretted the schedule cuts, which he said had been forced on it by \"government mismanagement of EU air travel\".  He added: \"It is inevitable, given the scale of these cutbacks, that we will be implementing more unpaid leave, and job sharing this winter in those bases where we have agreed reduced working time and pay, but this is a better short-term outcome than mass job losses.  \"There will regrettably be more redundancies at those small number of cabin crew bases, where we have still not secured agreement on working time and pay cuts, which is the only alternative.  \"We continue to actively manage our cost base to be prepared for the inevitable rebound and recovery of short haul air travel in Europe once an effective Covid-19 vaccine is developed.\" Earlier this year, foreign travel was paralysed for several months by the pandemic, with airlines, airports and tour firms shedding thousands of jobs. Since then, constant changes to the UK's list of countries subject to quarantine have confused potential holidaymakers and hampered the travel industry's efforts to recover. Airlines have been cutting costs in an effort to remain viable, with the International Air Transport Association warning that hundreds of thousands more jobs are at risk . Mr O'Leary has been extremely critical of the UK government's policy on quarantining people arriving in the country from overseas, describing it as \"a shambles\". The policy requires travellers to high-risk countries to isolate for two weeks on their return to the UK. At the same time, he has praised the Italian and German governments for having \"a much more aggressive test and trace system\". In his latest remarks, Mr O'Leary called on all EU governments to adopt the European Commission's traffic light system, which allows for safe air travel on a regional basis between areas that have Covid case rates of fewer than 50 per 100,000 people.",

State TV showed the C919 rising into the skies above Shanghai, heading to the capital Beijing early on Sunday. It was built by the Commercial Aviation Corporation of China (Comac) in the hope of breaking the dominance of Airbus and Boeing's single-aisle jets.  But the 164-seater still relies heavily on Western components, including engines and avionics.  The Shanghai-Beijing leg of the journey, with more than 130 passengers on board, was completed in just under three hours.  \"I'm really confident in our country,\" said passenger Liu Peng. He told Reuters news agency C919 \"will definitely get better and better\". \"I'm feeling very emotional,\" said 21-year-old student and flight enthusiast LV Boyuan. He spoke to Reuters at Shanghai airport before he boarded a normal flight to Chengdu, from where he planned to take a return C919 flight the day after. Designed to compete with jets from Europe's Airbus and the US airplane maker Boeing, the C919 can carry many more passengers and has a much longer range than its little brother, the ARJ21 - China's first domestic jet, in service since 2016.  State-backed China Eastern Airline has ordered five of the newer, bigger planes.  Comac - which plans to produce 150 planes annually in five years' time - says it has already secured more than 1,200 orders for the C919. Some experts, however, say that most of these orders are believed to be letters of intent from domestic customers. President Xi Jinping, who sat in the cockpit of a mock-up C919 a few years ago, has described the project as one of China's most innovative achievements. The C919 made its first test flight in 2017 and has undergone several similar flights since. ",

The airline's boss, Eddie Wilson, said it hoped to start taking delivery of the planes early next year. No Max planes have flown since March 2019 after issues with its software were linked to crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, which killed 346 people. Before the flight ban, Ryanair had 135 of them on order. \"The first of those we would hope to arrive in very early 2021,\" Mr Wilson told Ireland's Newstalk radio station. Investigators of the fatal crashes blamed faults in the 737 Max's flight control system, which Boeing has been overhauling for months in order to meet new safety demands. Mr Wilson was speaking after the US airline regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), issued a draft report on revised training procedures for the 737 Max. The FAA, which completed test flights last week, has invited comments from interested parties, with a deadline of 1 November. However, it is not the only regulator putting the modified 737 Max through its paces. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which started its own testing programme last month, has maintained that clearance by the FAA will not automatically mean the plane is considered airworthy in Europe. Last month, both Boeing and the FAA were harshly criticised by a US congressional investigation. Its report blamed a \"culture of concealment\" at Boeing and \"grossly insufficient oversight\" by the FAA.",

            "title": "Coronavirus: Emirates set to cut 9,000 jobs, citing pandemic",
            "text": "The president of Emirates said the Middle Eastern airline is set to cut as many as 9,000 jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic. It is the first time the world's biggest long-haul carrier has disclosed how many jobs will be lost. Prior to the crisis, Emirates had 60,000 staff. Sir Tim Clark said the airline had already cut a tenth of its staff but said: \"We will probably have to let go of a few more, probably up to 15%.\" The global airline industry has been severely impacted by coronavirus, with activity all but grinding to a halt.     In an interview with the BBC, Sir Tim said Emirates was \"not as badly off as others\". But its current situation marks a steep turnaround in the fortunes of the airline, which he said before the pandemic was \"heading for one of our best years ever\". The job cuts sweeping the wider aviation industry are fuelling concern amongst Emirates staff that things might get worse. The BBC understands there is growing frustration at what they see as poor communications and transparency from the airline. At least 700 of the airline's 4,500 pilots were given redundancy notices this week, which means at least 1,200 have been told their jobs are going since the coronavirus crisis started. The cuts have been focused on those who fly Airbus planes, rather than Boeing aircraft.  Emirates flies superjumbo Airbus A380s which hold around 500 passengers. Whereas the Boeing 777s it flies hold fewer passengers and are therefore easier to fill during this period of decreased airline travel.    00Thousands of cabin crew have also been told they are no longer needed. The International Air Transport Association, which represents 290 airlines, is forecasting that the world's airlines will lose more than $84bn and one million jobs this year. This week United Airlines, one of the big three in the US, warned its staff that it may have to cut 36,000 staff because of the huge fall in demand for air travel. Helane Becker, managing director and senior research analyst at investment firm Cowen said given \"the continuing issues surrounding the pandemic\" she expects US airlines to cull up to 200,000 of their 750,000 staff this year. US aviation unions are pushing the federal government to add to the $25bn bailout package it has provided so far. As part of the conditions for receiving state help, airlines have to protect jobs until the end of September. But IATA says there are wider benefits in doing so. A spokesman said the scale of job cuts in the aviation sector \"shows the severe economic crisis facing the industry and all who depend on air connectivity\".  Adding that its perfectly understandable that governments have put restrictions in place to try and keep people safe from coronavirus  \"but this should be done in the full knowledge of the economic and social consequences\".

            "text": "An American Airlines mechanic charged with sabotaging an aircraft in July has possible links to the Islamic State (IS) group, US prosecutors say. Abdul-Majeed Marouf Ahmed Alani, 60, has a brother in IS and had IS propaganda on his phone, they said. The plane, with 150 people on board, did not take off after the pilots received an error message. Mr Alani previously told police he had wanted to cause a delay or have the flight cancelled to get overtime work. He did not intend to cause any harm to either the plane or the passengers, he is quoted as saying in court papers. The 60-year-old, originally from Iraq, is being held without bail after prosecutors argued he presented a flight risk. He has not been charged with a terrorism-related crime. Assistant US Attorney Maria Medetis said a video showing people being shot had been sent from his phone and Mr Alani had allegedly told the recipient that God wanted harm to come to non-Muslims. She said it raised the possibility that his actions to damage the plane had had a deadly purpose. Two witnesses gave differing accounts about Mr Alani's brother - one colleague said Mr Alani had travelled to Iraq to meet his brother, who was an IS member, but his roommate said Mr Alani had travelled there because his brother had been kidnapped. Prosecutors did not provide evidence that Mr Alani had a brother in IS, media reports said. The plane was scheduled to fly from Miami to Nassau in the Bahamas on 17 July - but pilots aborted take-off after receiving an error message about the flight computer. Upon inspection, a piece of foam was found glued inside a navigation system part which stopped it from functioning. It was reportedly inside the tube leading from the outside of the plane to its air data module, a system that reports aircraft speed, pitch and other critical flight data Mr Alani told authorities that he was upset at a stalled contract dispute between the union and American Airlines, which he said had affected him financially. The naturalised US citizen, who has worked as an airline mechanic for 30 years, did eventually work overtime to help fix the plane.",

            "text": "An Air India passenger plane has made a \"precautionary landing\" at Stansted Airport after the airline initially reported a bomb threat. Flight AI191 was flying from the Indian city of Mumbai to Newark in the US. The Ministry of Defence said RAF Typhoon fighter jets escorted the aircraft as it made its landing. Air India confirmed an email came through to Mumbai airport with a bomb threat. The airline had initially tweeted about the scare, which has since been deleted, and later told Reuters news agency the threat was a hoax. A statement from Stansted Airport said the plane, which was carrying 327 passengers, landed at about 10:15 BST and was taken to an isolated part of the airport. The plane finally took off for Newark at 21:30 BST. Earlier, @DinoGoel tweeted to say passengers had been disembarked one by one, frisked and had their bags checked by hand and by sniffer dogs. He said they were then put on a bus and taken to the terminal, where they were offered water and snacks. In a later tweet, @DinoGoel said he and the rest of the passengers were being moved to Stansted main terminal.  He said: \"New crew coming from London. In the mean time all passengers have to go thru [sic] security and immigration again.\" An RAF spokesman said the Typhoon jets were launched from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire to escort the Air India plane to the airport in Essex. He said they were authorised to fly at supersonic speed and across nearby Derbyshire, a sonic boom was heard. The noise, which sounds like a thunder-clap, is created when an aircraft travels faster than sound - and it can cause damage to structures. Multiple calls were made to the police and fire service from people who feared there had been an explosion. The emergency services could not explain the cause of the loud bang heard shortly before 10:00 BST until the RAF confirmed it was their Typhoons and apologised for the inconvenience. Ever since the Battle of Britain, RAF aircraft have been ready to respond to any incursion or incident in the air.  Today it's the job of Typhoon jets based at RAF Coningsby, covering the south of the UK, and RAF Lossiemouth to the north.  The Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) Typhoons are armed with short and medium air-to-air missiles as well as their cannon.  Crews that are on call 24/7 are expected to be in the air within minutes of being scrambled.  The RAF will first try to make radio contact with the suspect aircraft - whether it's a civilian airliner or a Russian military jet near UK airspace. If that fails the pilots will use internationally recognised aviation signals to guide the aircraft.  Only as a very last resort would any aircraft be shot down.  That order would have to come from one of a handful of designated ministers, including the prime minister, via the RAF's command bunker at High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire. It hasn't happened yet. ",

            "text": "Emirates and Turkish Airlines have said the cabin ban on laptops no longer applies on their flights to the US. In March, the US banned laptops and other large electronic devices to and from eight mostly Muslim nations, fearing bombs may be concealed in them. Emirates, which flies to the US from its Dubai hub, said it worked with US authorities to meet new security rules. Turkish Airlines said it was also now allowing passengers travelling to the US to take their laptops onboard.  The two airlines are now in the same position as Etihad, which saw the ban lifted on Sunday for its flights from Abu Dhabi. Dubai, Istanbul and Abu Dhabi airports are reported to have put tighter security checks in place. Emirates said in a statement: \"Effective immediately, the electronics ban has been lifted for Emirates' flights from Dubai International Airport to the USA.\" The airline, which flies to 12 US cities from Dubai, thanked customers for \"their understanding and patience during the last few months\". Turkish Airlines said on Twitter that all electronic devices would be allowed on its US flights from Wednesday. It leaves Qatar, Morocco, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait waiting to have the ban lifted. Saudia, the flagship carrier for Saudi Arabia, said passengers would be able to take the electronics on US flights from 19 July. It remains unclear whether US-bound passengers going through Dubai and Istanbul airports will now need to factor in more time for security checks. The airlines aren't saying much about specific changes they have made. But Norman Shanks, an aviation security expert, said US officials will have been testing not only equipment but also procedures, in particular how stringent the checks are and how the staff carry them out. So increased vigilance can be expected. The new US security requirements extend to 105 countries, not just those subject to the laptop ban. A UK airports insider says that compliance with the new rules should be less difficult in Britain than elsewhere, given security requirements are already some of the world's most stringent. Airlines had expressed hope that new US guidelines announced last week would pave the way for the lifting of the electronics ban. The measures include enhanced screening, more thorough vetting of passengers and the wider use of bomb-sniffer dogs in 105 countries.  According to reports in Turkish media, US and UK officials visited Turkey's main international airport in Istanbul on Tuesday. Turkey has recently started using sophisticated tomography imaging devices for X-ray and ultrasound screening at Istanbul's Ataturk International Airport. Under the March rules, devices \"larger than a smartphone\" were not allowed on US-bound flights from the eight Middle East countries. The UK imposed similar rules to the US, but did not include Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The boss of Turkish Airlines has suggested he expects the UK to lift the ban for his airline soon. The UK government banned devices larger than 16.0cm x 9.3cm x 1.5cm on direct inbound flights from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia.",

            "title": "Iran plane downing: 'Several people detained' over airliner loss",
            "text": "Several people have been detained in Iran over the accidental shooting down of a Ukrainian passenger plane with a missile, the country's judiciary says. Spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said investigations into the incident were continuing, but provided no details. President Hassan Rouhani said the probe would be overseen by a \"special court\". Ukrainian International Airlines flight PS752 was brought down shortly it took off from Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board.  Most of the victims were Iranian and Canadian citizens. For the first three days after the crash, Iran denied that its armed forces had shot down the Boeing 737-800 and suggested there had been a technical failure. But as evidence mounted, the Revolutionary Guards said the operator of a missile defence system had mistaken the aircraft for a US cruise missile and fired at it. Iran's air defences had been on high alert because the country had just fired ballistic missiles at two US bases in Iraq, in retaliation for the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike in Baghdad. The admission of responsibility provoked widespread anger in Iran, and protesters took to the streets in the capital and several other cities to denounce government lies and the clerical leadership including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Mr Esmaili told a news conference in Tehran that the judiciary would \"investigate the causes and direct impact of the incident\". He added: \"We will investigate the extent to which US warmongering caused this event. Several people have been detained and the investigation continues.\" In a televised speech, President Rouhani said the judiciary would assemble a special court with a high-ranking judge and tens of experts to oversee the probe. \"This will not be a regular and usual case. The whole world will be watching this court,\" he added. Mr Rouhani also stressed that Wednesday's \"tragic event\" should not be blamed on one individual. \"It's not only the person who pulled the trigger, but also others who are responsible,\" he said. \"Iranian armed forces admitting their mistake is a good first step,\" he added. \"We should assure people that it will not happen again.\" The president also said he wanted relevant officials to explain publicly why it took days for the authorities to disclose that missiles were fired at flight PS752. The Iranian government's spokesman has denied that it was involved a cover-up, saying Mr Rouhani was not told what had happened until Friday evening. The commander of the Revolutionary Guards' Aerospace Force said on Saturday that he had informed \"officials\" about the strike hours after the incident. Mr Esmaili also said about 30 people had been arrested for \"taking part in illegal gatherings\" - an apparent reference to the recent anti-government protests. \"We have tolerance towards legal rallies,\" he added. On Monday, Tehran's police force denied it had fired live ammunition at protesters, after at least one person was reportedly shot and wounded the previous night. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC on Tuesday that he was \"glad\" Iran had acknowledged making a \"terrible mistake\" in shooting down the plane. \"It's good that they've apologised. The most important thing now is that tensions in the region calm down,\" he added.  \"I was in Oman just at the weekend, talking to people in the region, and they don't want a military conflict between the West and Iran.\"    Mr Johnson said the next step for Iran was to \"repatriate in a dignified way\" the bodies of the passengers and crew of flight PS752, who included three Britons. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said on Monday that five of the countries that had citizens on board the airliner - Canada, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Sweden and an unnamed country - would meet in London on Thursday to discuss possible legal action. He said the \"grieving nations\" would work out what steps to take individually and collectively to \"bring the perpetrators to justice and how we can repay those families who have suffered\". Canada, which lost 57 citizens, will meanwhile play a more active role than international rules require in the investigation into the shooting down of the airliner, according to the head of its Transportation Safety Board (TSB). The Canadian Transportation Safety Board's Kathy Fox said there were signs that Iran would allow the TSB to participate in the downloading and analysis of data from the plane's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder.

            "text": "The US will not delay a deadline for airlines to refit planes with new sensors to address possible 5G interference, despite concerns the cut-off date could cause travel disruption.  Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on Tuesday that airlines were told the 1 July deadline would remain in place. Airlines have warned that they will not be able to meet the deadline and may be forced to ground some planes.  Telecoms firms have previously delayed 5G rollout to allow airlines to adapt.  In the US, the radio frequencies being used for 5G are in part of the spectrum known as C-Band.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and aviation companies have previously raised concerns that C-Band spectrum 5G wireless could interfere with aircraft altimeters, which measure a plane's height above the ground.  In a call with airline companies on Tuesday, Mr Buttigieg told them to work aggressively to retrofit their planes before the deadline, according to the Reuters news agency. Concerns about 5G interference led to some disruptions at US airports last year.  Major tech companies, like Verizon and AT&T, agreed last year to delay the rollout of 5G technology until 1 July 2023 to allow airlines time to retrofit their altimeters.  The decision came after several previous delays.  The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade group representing more than 100 airlines that fly in and out of the US, has said the decision not to extend the deadline makes summer disruptions more likely.  \"Supply chain issues make it unlikely that all aircraft can be upgraded by the 1 July deadline, threatening operational disruptions during the peak northern summer travel season,\" the organisation said on Tuesday, adding that the estimated cost to upgrade planes is $638m (\u00a3511m). \"Airlines did not create this situation. They are victims of poor government planning and coordination,\" said Nick Careen from the IATA. Airlines have previously said they want 5G signals to be excluded from \"the approximate two miles of airport runways at affected airports as defined by the FAA\". Phone companies have spent tens of billions of dollars upgrading their networks to deploy the 5G technology, which they say brings much faster internet services and greater connectivity. Technology companies have said 5G is safe and have accused the aviation industry of fearmongering and distorting facts. In the EU, networks operate at lower frequencies than those which US providers are planning to use - reducing the risk of interference. 5G masts can also operate at lower power.  Nevertheless, some countries have taken further steps to reduce possible risks.  In France, there are so-called \"buffer zones\" around airports where 5G signals are restricted, while antennas have to be tilted downwards to prevent potential interference. The UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has said \"there have been no confirmed instances where 5G interference has resulted in aircraft system malfunction or unexpected behaviour\".  But it has stressed that \"different national mobile telecommunication strategies may mean that some [countries] have a higher threat exposure than others\".  In a separate development, the FAA on Tuesday proposed new rules for many Boeing aircraft due to the possibility of new 5G interference.  The proposed rules affect nearly 20,000 planes worldwide. They require revised flight manuals, bans on some landings, and new operating procedures for landings and approaches when dealing with 5G interference.  A representative for Boeing told Reuters that the company \"continues to work with suppliers, regulators, the airlines and telecom companies to ensure long-term stability and help mitigate operational restrictions where possible\".",

            "title": "Can China's plane-maker take on Boeing and Airbus?",
            "text": "For the past decade China, soon to become the world's largest aviation market, has been developing its own planes as it seeks to loosen Western manufacturers' grip on the sector. The planes made by Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China - or Comac - have drawn plenty of criticism.  Few in the industry believe Chinese-made jets will rival those of Boeing and Airbus in the near-term.  But analysts say that over time, state-backed Comac - part of China's wider push into high-tech manufacturing - could challenge the established players.  \"Do not underestimate Chinese ability to penetrate markets,\" says Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation advisory firm Endau Analytics.  He says the landscape is likely to shift from a European-US manufacturing duopoly to accommodate a third party - \"and that's probably the Chinese\".  So far it has built two jets - the ARJ21 and the C919 - and is working with Russia on a third.  Only the 90-seat, ARJ21 jet is in service. However, after suffering from delays, and being plagued with noise and other problems, the aircraft has been roundly rejected as inferior to planes from competitors such as Brazil's Embraer and Canada's Bombardier.  Among the critics is Teal Group aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia.  He says that while the aircraft was touted as proof China would be the next big jet maker, it turned into an \"overweight and stunningly obsolete product that has no relevance outside of China's tiny regional airline sector\". Comac has bigger ambitions for the C919. Seating up to 168 people, China's first large passenger jet is designed to compete with Boeing's 737 Max and Airbus's A320neo.  Its third test flight was completed in December and first deliveries are scheduled for 2021.   Comac did not respond to BBC requests for comment. But data from consultancy Frost & Sullivan shows the firm has received nearly 1,000 commitments for the C919, mostly from Chinese airlines and domestic leasing firms. The order book includes the country's three major carriers Air China, China Southern and China Eastern.  Still, some remain sceptical that Comac will hit its 2021 target given the problems that surrounded its first plane. Teal Group's Mr Aboulafia says there is a \"serious risk\" that by the time the C919 enters service Airbus and Boeing will have far better models on offer.  In partnership with Russia, Comac is also developing the CR929, a wide-body aircraft with a range of 12,000km that seats 280 passengers. Right now, only China's aviation regulator has certified Comac jets to fly. Its aircraft may also operate in parts of Asia, Africa and South America that recognise Chinese certification.  However, to expand beyond those markets it needs the green light from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Those approvals are far from certain.  \"There is still a big question mark over whether it will receive a Western certification,\" Flight Global's Asia finance editor Ellis Taylor says.  He says Comac had hoped the ARJ21 would get FAA certification \"but that has been shelved indefinitely\".     Even if those doors remain shut, Comac has access to a huge and growing market. By the mid-2020's, China's aviation market is expected to overtake the US as the world's largest by traffic.  It's a major buyer of Western planes, but the crisis facing Boeing could generate more interest in locally-made alternatives.  The country operates the largest fleet of Boeing 737 Max aircraft and was the first to ground the troubled jet after the deadly Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crash in March. The same model was involved in a Lion Air crash that killed 189 people less than five months earlier.  Frost & Sullivan aerospace consultant Ramesh Tanjavuru says, provided Comac secures certification, Boeing's troubles could fuel the growth of the C919 in China and abroad.  \"They could definitely fill the gap and be a significant player in China's market.\" Comac also has its sights set on emerging markets in parts of Africa and Asia. Its planes are more affordable, with the C919's list price of reportedly about $50m (\u00a338.8m) roughly half the price of the Airbus A320neo.  But the push into these regions also supports Beijing's broader foreign policy goals.  China, through its Belt and Road initiative, is pouring as much as $1 trillion into infrastructure projects around the world. Endau Analytics' Mr Yusof says China's entry into plane manufacturing is part of this drive.  He says some countries in Africa have received loans to build airports that are designed to meet the requirements of the ARJ21. Aiding poorer countries with infrastructure development, Mr Yusof says, is another way of building Comac's customer base.  \"We can't just underestimate the Chinese ability to go into markets and carve a niche where Airbus and Boeing aren't interested [such as] Africa or central Asia.\" ",

            "title": "Ryanair hit by air fare battle and Brexit uncertainty",
            "text": "Ryanair has reported a sharp fall in quarterly profits as it reduced fares to drive up passenger numbers. Profits fell 21% to \u20ac243m (\u00a3219m) for the three months to the end of June, as the average ticket price fell 6%. The airline was also hit by higher costs for fuel and staff. Chief executive Michael O'Leary said the two weakest markets were Germany, where Ryanair faced fierce competition on price, and the UK, where there were Brexit uncertainties. Mr O'Leary said that in Germany, \"Lufthansa was allowed to buy Air Berlin and is selling this excess capacity at below cost prices\". Meanwhile in the UK, \"Brexit concerns weigh negatively on consumer confidence and spending\". He added that \"the current weak fare environment has continued into the second quarter and we expect [first half] fares to be down approximately 6%\". Ryanair said the drop in fares had been partially offset by 14% higher ancillary revenue, such as from baggage, food and other fees. \"The June quarter results were not quite as bad as feared,\" Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said in a note, adding that ticket revenue was \"slightly light\" compared with forecasts but that revenue from optional extras was \"better than anticipated\". In a call with analysts, the airline boss also warned that Ryanair might cut routes from London to Glasgow, Edinburgh and Belfast in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  \"An obvious one [to cut] if there is a hard Brexit at the end of October, we have three UK domestic routes... they would readily fall out straight away,\" he said. \"There is a longer-term question mark over those in a hard Brexit,\" Mr O'Leary said. \"Frankly... we are not growing in Edinburgh, Glasgow or Belfast.\" Earlier this month, the carrier said it was adjusting its schedules because of the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max family of jets. It cut the number of new Max jets it was expecting to operate next summer from 58 to 30. However, Mr O'Leary said on Monday that he was \"concerned that the Max return to service keeps slipping\". He said the estimate for how many 737 Max planes Ryanair operates next summer could drop to 20, \"which would significantly truncate our growth rate\". But, he also said that the number could move to 10 or zero if the situation was not sorted out \"pretty quickly with the regulator\". The forecast for profits after tax for the year remains unchanged at between \u20ac750m and \u20ac950m (\u00a3675m-\u00a3850m).  In recent weeks, the airline has been hit by the threat of strike action by pilots in the UK and Ireland and cabin crew in Portugal. Chief financial officer Niall Sorohan has said the airline is open to talks with staff.",

            "title": "Boeing 737 Max: 'I lost my family in the Ethiopian plane crash'",
            "text": "\"I lost my wife Carole, my three children Ryan, Kelly and Ruby and I also lost my mum-in-law. I feel so lonely. I look at people. I see them with their children playing outside and I cannot have my children - I'll never be able to see their faces again or hear their voices.\" Paul Njoroge lost his entire family when Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed six minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa on 10 March. 157 people died.  Paul is now living between friends' houses, unable to return home. He can't bear to see his children's shoes still in the hall where they last left them. \"I can still see their feet inside them. I'm never going back.\" He's waiting for relatives to pack up the home.  When ET302 crashed it was the second Boeing 737 Max to crash in four months.  The first happened in Indonesia in November 2018. Preliminary reports revealed that the same flight control system was at fault in both crashes. Now families around the world want to know why 157 people died in a second crash.  They are asking, why weren't the jets grounded after the first crash? Chris and Claryss Moore's daughter Danielle was also killed. One corner of their suburban Toronto home is now a bright but emotive shrine to their lost child. She smiles down from a dozen pictures on the wall, surrounded by orchids and lilies. Danielle was heading to a UN environmental conference in Kenya.  \"This should not have happened, four months after another crash happened. They tell us this is one of the safest planes - it's not - it took away the lives of the people we love so much and no matter what they're going to say, our normal lives will never be the same.  This is our normal life, struggling to wake up every single day and that's hard. It makes me very angry.\" An international blame game is now under way. American Congressman Sam Graves alongside other voices in the US have blamed \"foreign pilots\" for the crash, saying they believe American pilots would have handled the jet.  But both preliminary reports have stated the flight control system (MCAS) as being at fault.  Families of those killed are now lining up to ask whether the Boeing 737 Max was airworthy and safe when the crash happened. \"My family died because of Boeing's negligence, arrogance, management disfunction and lack of internal oversight and the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration),\" says Paul Njorogre. \"They had a chance to ground these planes in November and they didn't. Instead they focused on foreign pilot error fallacy. 157 people died including my family because of them making them poor decisions.  If they really cared about human life and safety they would have grounded those planes in November and they would have fixed the problem. They allowed the planes to fly as they tried to fix the problem. They didn't fix it by 10th March.\" Nadia Milleron and her husband Michael Stumo live in Western Massachusetts, USA. It's peaceful.  Their family home is enveloped by forests and mountains. Their daughter Samya Rose Stumo was 24 years old and was on board ET302.  She is the second of the couple's four children to die. They also lost a son to cancer.  \"It's been like a horrible dream,\" says Nadia. \"And I keep thinking all these people I'm meeting, going to Washington, all these experiences I'm having, they're awful because they mean Samya is gone. And I don't want that to be the case. I keep thinking I am going to wake up.\" Nadia was listening to BBC World Service radio when reports first came in about the crash. She knew Samya was on board. She'd had a Whatsapp message from her only an hour earlier giving her flight information.  \"I just started shaking, and I couldn't stop myself from physically shaking,\" she told me. \"I just couldn't tell the other people in the house.\" Within a month, Nadia and Michael turned their overwhelming sense of loss and grief into a remarkable force of energy.  They're now committed to finding out why Boeing didn't ground the planes after the first crash, whether Boeing cut corners in regards to safety of the 737 Max and why  the FAA certified it as safe to fly. To date, they've met more than 25 Congressmen and women in Washington, as well as being a powerful presence at US Government aviation hearings.  They've not been allowed to testify but they want to ensure families are included in how investigations develop.  Critics are asking whether the development and launch of the Boeing 737 Max was rushed. They claim Boeing was losing out to a plane from Airbus and suggest corners were cut to get the Max into service.  \"Definitely my daughter died because of the profit of Boeing and I don't want anyone else to die for that reason. I want these planes to be safe and [for Boeing to] invest in the company and the hardware and infrastructure to make our aviation industry safe,\" said Nadia. The BBC approached Boeing for an interview and comment in regards to all of these allegations. They declined.  In a statement Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing chairman, said: \"We're sorry for the tragic loss of life in these accidents and extend our deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones of all those on board. Any loss of life on our airplanes is unacceptable, and this will continue to weigh heavily on our hearts for years to come. The safety of the flying public is our highest priority and we are focused on re-earning their trust and confidence in the months ahead.\" Earlier this week, Boeing announced they were offering $100m to \"family and community needs of those affected by the tragic accidents of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.  \"These funds will support education, hardship and living expenses for impacted families.\"  The families we've spoken to are not impressed. They don't want money. They want answers.  Chris Moore believes criminal charges should be brought. \"If there is any type of personal culpability they should be charged under criminal laws. If I cost someone's life on a building site I would have to prove myself in a criminal court as innocent, why are Boeing different?\" Paul Njoroge believes the crash of ET302 was preventable, \"but these individuals knew that they would not be held criminally liable, they would not face years in prison. But if they knew they'd face years in prison they would have grounded these planes in November.\" The families of victims are all now searching for answers.  Some are dealing with their grief in private, still too overwhelmed by what's happened.  Others have the power and resolve to speak out - and it's starting to prove uncomfortable for Boeing. ",

            "text": "The first foreign aid planes have arrived in Tonga, bearing much-needed supplies for the Pacific nation which was left devastated by a volcanic eruption and subsequent tsunami on Saturday. New Zealand said its military plane landed at Tonga's main airport after workers cleared ash from the runway. Australia also confirmed the first of its relief planes had arrived.  Aid efforts had initially been hampered by ash from the volcano. At least three people have died and communications have been crippled, and Tonga has only just begun to re-establish global contact after five days cut off from the rest of the world. On Thursday, New Zealand's Defence Force confirmed its C-130 Hercules plane touched down in Tonga just after 16:00 local time (03:00 GMT). It was loaded with water containers, temporary shelter kits, electricity generators, hygiene and family kits and communications equipment. Hours afterwards, Australian defence minister Peter Dutton tweeted the first plane despatched by the Australia Defence Forces had landed, carrying \"humanitarian assistance and disaster relief supplies.\" Australia said the first of its two Boeing C-17 Globemaster relief planes also had a \"sweeping\" device on board to help keep the runway clear. Rescue teams and hundreds of volunteers had for days desperately worked to clear the thick layer of ash at the airport runway in the capital Nuku'alofa that had prevented planes from landing.  Volunteers used wheelbarrows and shovels, in what New Zealand's commander of joint forces Rear Admiral Jim Gilmour called a \"mammoth effort\". \"After the eruption, all of Tonga just turned grey,\" Tongan journalist Marian Kupu told the BBC from the capital Nuku'alofa. \"We're talking about dogs and cars and buildings, they were all covered in ashes.\" Ms Kupu said the thickness of the ashfall made clearing the runway \"difficult\", and posed a possible health threat to those engaged with the task, who were \"mainly young boys\". Both Australian and New Zealand authorities have confirmed that the aid drops will be contactless, to prevent the risk of Covid spreading to the island which has seen just one case of the virus so far in the pandemic.  \"The aircraft is expected to be on the ground for up to 90 minutes before returning to New Zealand,\" said New Zealand's Defence Minister Peeni Henare. Rear Adm Gilmour said no-contact Covid protocols were \"being adhered to rigorously\", adding that relief procedures would include making sure the airplane crew would have no contact with anyone on the ground, and that everyone would be wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).  \"We are very respectful that the last thing that Tonga would need now is a Covid outbreak on top of this disaster,\" he added.  Australia has also said no personnel would disembark from their planes. A New Zealand naval ship is also due to arrive in Tonga on Thursday, ahead of other supply ships.  Mr Henare earlier told the BBC the supply ships would bring more than 250,000 litres of fresh water and desalination equipment, used to separate salt from water. \"The most pressing matter that's come through from the Tongan government is the need for fresh water,\" he said. Ms Kupu echoed similar fears that water supplies on the Pacific island nation would run out, saying they were \"praying for water, for heavy rain ... we do not have enough water.\" Meanwhile, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in the heavily Mormon nation says it has been providing significant shelter and clean water supplies to locals in the past days. Contact with Tonga remains limited. A 2G connection has been restored by a telecommunications provider Digicel but the line is being overwhelmed by the demand. The main severed undersea cable connecting the remote island nation to the outside world may also take weeks to fix. Recently released pictures from Tonga's consulate in the European Union, have shown the extent of the damage including cars, roads and buildings in Nuku'alofa coated in a film of ash.  Aerial images taken by the New Zealand Air Force, meanwhile, indicate that several villages have been wiped out on islands that have yet to be reached. The explosion of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano was felt as far away as the US. In Peru, two people drowned in abnormally high waves while beaches near the capital Lima were closed off following an oil spill. Do you live in Tonga or do you know someone who has been affected?

            "text": "Five British citizens were unlawfully killed when Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was shot down in eastern Ukraine, a coroner has concluded. A joint inquest into the deaths of five of the 298 on board has been held in England, where their bodies were repatriated to. The court heard evidence that a Buk missile was fired from Ukraine by pro-Russian separatists. It exploded in front of the cockpit of the aircraft, the inquest heard. Fragments of the missile then killed crew members in the cockpit and caused significant damage to the aircraft, causing it to break up. The inquest was held in Leicester for the following five passengers: The aircraft was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on 17 July 2014 when it was shot down. All of the 283 passengers and 15 crew members were killed. Of those who died, 10 were British. The inquest heard evidence from Det Ch Supt Dominic Murphy, from the Counter Terrorism Command (SO15) of the Metropolitan Police. He said a criminal investigation taking place in The Hague had identified four individuals as possibly being responsible for the missile, and they were being tried in their absence. \"MH17 departed from Amsterdam and it had been flying for about three hours when it lost contact with air traffic control,\" he said, summarising an investigation by the Dutch Safety Board. He said the missile exploded in front of the cockpit of the aircraft, and fragments penetrated the aircraft on the left hand side of the cockpit. Fragments of metal were found in the bodies of crew members when their remains were recovered, he said. He said the missile system appeared to have been smuggled over the border to Ukraine from Russia on 16 and 17 July. Det Ch Supt Murphy said wreckage from the aircraft and the bodies of passengers were spread over a wide area, which made them \"a challenge to recover\". The five victims were identified using dental records, fingerprints and DNA testing, before being repatriated to England. After hearing all of the evidence, coroner Catherine Mason said: \"I am satisfied that MH17 was shot down by a Buk missile that was fired by pro-Russian separatists. \"Taking all of the evidence into account, I have decided that the appropriate conclusion is that Liam Sweeney, Richard Mayne, Glenn Thomas, John Alder and Benjamin Pocock were unlawfully killed.\" Tributes from family members were read out at the start of the inquest. Richard Maine's mother, Liz Maine, said he \"lived life on the edge, living life apace and at full throttle as if he knew he was going to die young and had to fit everything in\". She said her family could \"find no meaning in Richard's death\". \"We can see a randomness but mostly in the light of the recent conflict and atrocities in Ukraine a calculated, sadistic cruelty that has to do with evil and the opposite of all that Richard innately stood for and encapsulated: courage, camaraderie, largess, love, optimism and hope,\" she said. Barry Sweeney said his son Liam was obsessed with watching Newcastle United play, and was travelling to see them in New Zealand when he died. \"Liam was the truest fan of Newcastle United and he died doing what he loved most in life,\" said his father. \"Liam's mum, Angela, never got over losing him, and tragically she passed away on 9 February 2017.\" He had been travelling with his friend John Alder, a fellow Newcastle United fan. In a statement read to the inquest, Mr Alder's brother said he had \"come to be recognised as Newcastle United's number one fan\", and it was thought he had only missed one first team game in over 40 years. He collected football programmes and other memorabilia, and these were auctioned after his death, raising \u00a326,000 for the Bobby Robson Foundation. Tributes were read out on behalf of Glenn Thomas's twin sister and nephew. They spoke of a generous man who travelled the world and took relatives on trips with him. \"We were blessed to have Glenn in our lives for 49 years and he was such a free spirit,\" said his sister. \"He has done more in his 49 years than anyone can possibly do in a lifetime.\"",

            "text": "A passenger plane travelling from the south Indian city of Trichy to Dubai sustained damage after hitting the airport wall during take off. Air India IX 611, which was carrying 130 passengers and six crew members, was diverted to Mumbai, where it landed safely.  Air India said the two pilots, who have more than 6,500 hours of flying experience between them, have been grounded, pending investigation.  Air India is India's national carrier. The airline said in a statement that the Boeing 737 aircraft took off from Trichy airport in southern India early on Friday when airport officials \"observed that aircraft might have come in contact with the airport perimeter wall\". The aircraft has sustained some damage.  \"The matter was conveyed to the pilot in command. The pilot in command reported that the aircraft systems were operating normally.\" The plane was then diverted to the western city of Mumbai.  The incident has been reported to the aviation regulator and Air India says it is cooperating with the investigation. It comes weeks after more than 30 passengers aboard Indian carrier Jet Airways had to receive treatment after pilots \"forgot\" to turn on a switch regulating cabin pressure. One of India's oldest airlines, Air India has not turned a profit since 2007. In June 2017, India's cabinet approved plans to privatise the carrier. But it failed to attract buyers after the federal government offered to sell a controlling stake. Any buyer would have to take on about $5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of debt, which is only about half of what the airline owes.",

            "title": "China plane crash: Search teams find flight's black box",
            "text": "Search teams have found a black box from the China Eastern flight which nosedived into mountains in southern China this week, state media report. Chinese aviation officials announced the finding at a press conference on Wednesday, after two days of searching. Authorities are still yet to report the number of dead, but it is feared none of the 132 people on board survived the high-altitude crash. Investigators still do not know why the plane plummeted out of the sky. Mao Yanfeng, director of the civil aviation accident investigation department, told reporters there had been \"no dangerous weather\" on the plane's route at the time of the crash. He added the plane's crew and air traffic control had maintained normal communication until the plane's sudden drop in altitude. At the same press conference, the chairman of China Eastern Airlines' Yunnan branch Sun Shiying said the plane had been deemed airworthy and had met required maintenance standards, reported Xinhua. The crash is likely China's most deadly aviation incident in three decades, and has prompted a national outpouring of grief. President Xi Jinping has called for a full-scale investigation, and the government has dispatched hundreds of rescuers, soldiers, experts and other workers to the site in the remote hills of Guangxi province. On Wednesday, the devastated families of the 123 passengers and nine crew on board the flight also arrived at the crash site, gathering in the small village closest to the scene. They were escorted by officials carrying umbrellas as they entered Lu village. One 57-year-old man, whose sister-in law was on the flight, told the waiting media: \"All I want is hope, the hope of survival.\" Hundreds of search workers have been scouring the forested region of Wuzhou, in search of the plane's black box recorders amid the wreckage and charred debris. Authorities have said that they have not found any survivors so far, and rescue crews have yet to find any bodies.  However teams have recovered many personal items belonging to passengers and crew, including purses, wallets and even identity cards. Flight MU5735 had been in the air for more than an hour on Monday and was nearing its Guangzhou destination when it suddenly dropped from its cruising height. Air controllers had repeatedly called the\u00a0aircraft during its descent but had received no\u00a0response, authorities said on Tuesday. Flight tracker data showed the Boeing 737-800 jet dropped thousands of metres in under three minutes. According to FlightRadar24, the plane was cruising at 29,100ft (about 9,000m), but two minutes and 15 seconds later it was recorded at 9,075ft. The last sourced information on the flight showed it ended at 14:22 local time, at an altitude of 3,225ft.  Aviation experts say the Boeing 737-800 model has a strong safety record, with thousands in service around the world. The aircraft that crashed was less than seven years old.  Investigators are expected to look at several possible causes - including deliberate action, pilot error, or technical issues such as a structural failure or mid-air collision.",

            "title": "Tui travel firm warns Boeing grounding to hit earnings",
            "text": "Travel firm Tui has warned that the grounding of Boeing 737 Max planes could cost it up to \u20ac300m (\u00a3258m). Tui has a fleet of about 150 aircraft, including 15 of the grounded Boeing models. A further eight 737 Max planes are due for delivery by the end of May. The financial hit is due to the cost of aircraft replacements, higher fuel bills and other disruption costs. Tui will use eight older Boeing 737s, plus spare and charter aircraft, to \"guarantee\" customer holidays. It said it would take a \u20ac200m hit should Boeing 737s resume flights at the latest by mid-July. However, if in the coming weeks it looks as though the planes will not be flying by mid-July, Tui said it would extend the measures it was taking until the end of September, costing the firm another \u20ac100m. Boeing grounded its entire global fleet of 737 Max aircraft earlier this month after one of the planes, operated by Ethiopian Airlines, crashed, killing all 157 passengers and crew. This came five months after a fatal crash involving another 737 Max plane operated by Lion Air in Indonesia By Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent The grounding of the 737 Max was inevitably going to prove costly for the airlines using it. To avoid cancelling services, they have had to look around for replacement aircraft. Tui says it has had to use spare planes in its fleet, extend leases that were due to expire - and hire in extra planes. This has largely been done by so-called wet-leasing, where an aircraft is provided ready to use, with a flight crew. It's not cheap. A wet lease can cost upwards of $3,000 per hour. Fuel is also an issue. The main selling point of the 737 Max was its low fuel consumption. Using older, thirstier aircraft is inevitably going to cost more. These losses are not covered by insurance - though Tui admits it will be holding talks with Boeing. So although safety is undoubtedly their first priority, companies using the 737 Max will be very keen to see the aircraft back in the skies as soon as possible. In a statement, Tui said: \"The group is utilising spare aircraft of its fleet, extending expiring leases for aircraft that were supposed to be replaced by 737 Max aircraft, as well as leasing in additional aircraft.\" A spokesman said Tui could not get insurance to cover this type of eventuality. However, Tui has a good relationship with Boeing, and has new aircraft on order, so should be able to recoup the cost in some form. Tui said: \"No dates have yet been announced for modifications of the existing aircraft model by the manufacturer, neither for approval of such modifications by the Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency. \"Therefore, Tui has taken precautions, along with other airlines, covering the time until mid-July, in order to be prepared for Easter, Whitsun, and start of the summer holiday season and to secure holidays for its customers and their families.\" Tui shares initially fell more than 8% following the announcement, before recovering some ground to stand 5% lower. \"Tui's 737 Max-related profit warning announcement feels like a watershed moment,\" said Nick Wyatt from analytics firm GlobalData. \"It marks the first time that a company directly affected by the grounding has spoken publicly on the impact it expects the grounding to have and it doesn't make for good reading. \"Tui had 15 of the affected aircraft in operation and the likes of Southwest Airlines, Air Canada, American Airlines, China Southern, and Norwegian all had more. \"Given this, Tui's warning is unlikely to be the last and the impact for airlines that need to cover a greater number of grounded jets by both extending leases and taking out new ones will be even more acute.\"",

            "text": "A passenger plane landing at an airport in Istanbul has skidded off the runway and broken into three parts, killing three people and injuring 180 others, officials say. The Pegasus Airlines jet was carrying 177 passengers and six crew members from Izmir province in the west when it crashed at Sabiha Gokcen airport. The Boeing 737 was trying to land in heavy tailwinds and rain. The airport was closed and flights diverted after the accident. The majority of people on board were Turkish, but local media quoted the airline's records as saying there were 22 foreign passengers from 12 other countries. A small number of children are believed to have been on board. Istanbul Governor Ali Yerlikaya said: \"Unfortunately, the Pegasus Airlines plane couldn't hold on the runway due to poor weather conditions and skidded for around 50-60m [164-196ft].\" He said the plane then fell between 30 and 40 metres off the end of the runway. The airport has since reopened, while prosecutors have opened an investigation into the crash.  Video footage showed passengers climbing through one of the large cracks to escape via one of the wings, and dozens of rescuers working around the jet. Other footage on social media showed a blaze inside the aircraft, which was later put out by firefighters. Transport Minister Mehmet Cahit Turhan said authorities had not yet been able to speak to the pilots, a Turkish national and a South Korean, who were believed to have been injured in the accident. The low-cost Pegasus Airlines has a fleet of 83 aircraft - 47 Boeings and 36 Airbus planes - and has been flying for 20 years. A Pegasus Boeing 737 coming in from Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates skidded off the runway at the same airport on 7 January. There were no casualties but the airport had to be temporarily closed. And a Pegasus Boeing 737 also skidded off the runway at Trabzon airport in January 2018, plunging down the side of a cliff overlooking the sea. There were no casualties.",

            "text": "Two planes came within 875 metres of each other at a Scottish airport, an investigation has found. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report found the landing Boeing 737 was less than 1km away from a departing Airbus A320 at Edinburgh Airport. The incident in August last year is described by investigators as a \"loss of separation\" between the two planes. The AAIB said it had been caused by delays and inexperienced staff. The airport's air navigation service provider has reviewed operations at Edinburgh and taken a number of safety measures to improve procedures and on-the-job training for trainee air traffic controllers. More than 350 people were on both flights and no-one was injured as a result of the \"runway incursion\". In its report, the AAIB stated: \"A landing Boeing 737 closed to within 875 metres of a departing Airbus A320 when landing at Edinburgh airport. \"The airport air traffic control service provider defined this as a runway incursion as the 737 was over the runway surface when the A320 was still on its take-off roll. \"A combination of factors, including brief delays to the departure of the A320 and the speed of the Boeing 737 being higher than normal, led to the reduction in separation before the controllers became aware of the closeness of the aircraft. \"The trainee controller lacked the experience to resolve the situation in a timely manner and the supervising on-the-job training instructor judged it safer to let the 737 land than to initiate a go-around in proximity to the departing aircraft.\" The report also noted the crew of the departing Airbus aircraft were unaware of the situation throughout and therefore could not react to it. A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said: \"Safety is absolutely paramount in our operations, a priority shared by Air Navigation Solutions [the firm which provides air traffic control services at Edinburgh] and we have discussed this incident in depth with them. \"We are satisfied that the remedial measures put in place are robust and continue to regard safety as the number one priority.\" ",

            "text": "The US Department of Commerce has again ruled against aerospace firm Bombardier in its dispute with rival Boeing.  A further tariff of 80% has been imposed on the import of Bombardier's C-Series jet to the US for alleged below-cost selling. This is on top of an earlier tariff of 220% which related to subsidies Bombardier got from Canada and the UK. There have been warnings that the import tariffs could threaten Bombardier jobs in Belfast. About 1,000 jobs are linked to the C-Series, the wings of which are made at a purpose-built \u00a3520m factory in the city. A spokesperson for Bombardier said: \"We strongly disagree with the commerce department's preliminary decision.\" The firm said the ruling represented an \"egregious overreach and misapplication of U.S. trade laws\". \"The commerce department's approach throughout this investigation has completely ignored aerospace industry realities,\" it said. \"This hypocrisy is appalling, and it should be deeply troubling to any importer of large, complex, and highly engineered products.\" The programme is not just important to Bombardier jobs in Belfast, but also to 15 smaller aerospace firms in Northern Ireland - and dozens more across the UK - which make components for the wings. The US Department of Commerce rulings, which could more than triple the cost of a C-Series aircraft sold into the US, could jeopardise a major order placed last year from US airline Delta. A final ruling in the case is due early next year. Davy Thompson from the Unite union said workers are very concerned.  \"It looms very large over these workers and it's time for the British government to actually step up for British workers,\" he said.   \"We see the British government being bullied by Boeing.  \"The EU needs to step in, because effectively they are being bullied too. It needs to stop and it needs to stop now.\"  A government spokesperson described the latest development as \"disappointing\", but said it was \"hardly surprising given last week's preliminary ruling sided with Boeing\".  \"As with the investigation into subsidies, this is only the first step in the process,\" they added.  \"Since the interim finding, we have had further Cabinet level engagement with the US Administration and Canadian government.  \"We continue to make all efforts alongside the Canadian government to get Boeing to the table to resolve the case.\" In a statement Boeing said: \"Today's decision follows a fact-based investigation by the Commerce Department and it validates Boeing's dumping complaints regarding Bombardier's pricing in the United States.  \"This was an avoidable outcome within Bombardier's control. The laws governing global trade are transparent and well known.\" US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said: \"The United States is committed to free, fair and reciprocal trade with Canada, but this is not our idea of a properly functioning trading relationship\". \"We will continue to verify the accuracy of this decision, while doing everything in our power to stand up for American companies and their workers.\" The Canadian aerospace firm employs more than 4,000 workers across four sites in Northern Ireland. Components of the C-Series jet are manufactured at a purpose-built factory in east Belfast and many other local firms are involved in the supply chain.  The punitive tax would significantly raise the price of the jet in the US market, and threaten the future of the product. Boeing took the case after accusing Bombardier of anti-competitive practices. It claimed its rival was selling the C-Series jets below cost price after taking state subsidies from the Canadian and British governments. When the preliminary tax ruling was made last week, Wilbur Ross said: \"The subsidisation of goods by foreign governments is something that the Trump administration takes very seriously.\" The US trade commission is due to rule on the Department of Commerce's 220% tax proposal next year, but the Irish Small and Medium Enterprise (ISME) Association said the EU should not wait for the final decision.  Its chief executive, Neil McDonnell, said the EU \"should signal right now that it will unconditionally, unequivocally and aggressively oppose protectionist measures by the US with tariffs of like effect\".",

            "text": "Several airlines have grounded Boeing 737 Max 8 jets following a deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash. The flight crashed minutes after takeoff on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board. It was the second disaster in five months involving a Boeing 737 Max 8.  Aviation regulators in China and Indonesia have suspended flights using that model. Ethiopian Airlines, Cayman Airways and Comair, have also grounded their 737 Max 8 aircraft. Boeing shares fell 13% in early trading on Wall Street, but then recovered some of those losses. While experts warn it is too early to say what caused the Ethiopian Airlines disaster, it comes after the same model crashed in a flight operated by Lion Air in October. The plane lost altitude soon after takeoff, killing 189 people on board.  \"Given that two accidents both involved newly delivered Boeing 737 Max 8 planes and happened during take-off phase, they have some degree of similarity,\" the Civil Aviation Administration of China said in a statement. The Chinese regulator ordered local carriers to ground all 737 Max 8 flights by 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT).  Air China, China Eastern Airlines, Kunming Airlines, and China Southern Airlines are among the carriers affected. More than 90 Boeing 737 Max 8 models are in use in mainland China. The Indonesian Transport Ministry said inspections would begin on 12 March of one Garuda Indonesia plane and 10 operated by Lion Air.  Planes would be grounded until cleared by safety regulator. Shares in French aerospace group Safran, which makes the engines for the 737, fell on Monday.  The aircraft is relatively new to the skies, having only been in commercial use since 2017. Boeing said it was \"deeply saddened\" by the crash and is sending a team to provide technical assistance to the investigation.  The investigation will be led by Ethiopian authorities co-ordinating with teams of experts from Boeing and the US National Transportation Safety Board. The Indian government said it was discussing the situation with local regulators. Jet Airways and SpiceJet - neither of which made any comment - both use the aircraft. Comair, which has the franchise for British Airways in South Africa, said it was removing its 737 Max from its schedule while it \"consults with other operators, Boeing and technical experts\". According to Boeing's website, 16 airlines have taken delivery of the 737 Max 8.\u00a0 TUI Group has 15 in its fleet and said it is in close contact with the manufacturer, but has no plans to take them out of service.  It is the only airline to have any such planes registered with the UK's Civil Aviation Authority. A spokesperson for Flydubai told Reuters the carrier is \"monitoring the situation\".  Norwegian Airlines, which has 18 in its fleet largely flying between Ireland the US, is continuing to use the planes. Its director of flight operations said the airline will follow any recommendations from Boeing and aviation authorities. It has three - including one from London Gatwick to Helsinki - in use today. Singapore's SilkAir said it was in contact with Boeing and all its flights using 737 Max 8 aircraft - of which it has six - are operating as normal, while Air Italy is also operating its planes as normal.   Several North American airlines also operate the aircraft and have said they are monitoring the investigation.  Southwest Airlines flies 34 of the aircraft and  said it had been in contact with Boeing and was operating as normal. American Airlines and Air Canada each have 24 in their fleet.",

            "text": "South Yorkshire could see 8,000 new jobs and an estimated \u00a31.2bn of funding, after being named as the UK's first Investment Zone, it is claimed. In March Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said 12 new UK Investment Zones, would each receive \u00a380m of government cash. The money could be spent on infrastructure, training and tax relief over seven years. Announcing the first zone in Sheffield on Thursday Mr Hunt said it already had a further \u00a380m of private investment. At the AMRC research institute Mr Hunt claimed the first Advanced Manufacturing Investment Zone would bring opportunity into areas \"which had traditionally underperformed economically\". He said Boeing, Spirit AeroSystems, Loop Technology and the University of Sheffield's AMRC institute had partnered to support the first investment worth over \u00a380m. Investment Zones were launched under Liz Truss's government last September with an initial announcement of hundreds of zones, which would typically be clustered around universities. The UK Treasury reduced the plan to 12 zones after Jeremy Hunt became chancellor, eight of them already allocated to English mayoral regions in the north and Midlands. A spokesperson for HM Treasury said the Investment Zone would mean people from Sheffield, Rotherham, Doncaster and Barnsley would see fewer challenges in attracting finance and investment and more opportunities for new jobs and increased productivity. The spokesperson said the project, co-funded by industry and government, with support from the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority and the University of Sheffield, would see the UK \"at the cutting edge of aviation research, development and manufacturing\".  Mr Hunt said: \"Our first Investment Zone is a shining example of how we will drive growth across the country.  \"It's already secured more than \u00a380m of private investment, including backing from Boeing, and will help support more than 8,000 jobs by 2030.\" Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, Michael Gove, said the announcement was \"a significant moment for South Yorkshire\".  \"This will help level up the region, creating jobs and boosting economic growth,\" he said. Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch said Boeing and its partners' investment in the new zone was a \"major vote of confidence in our world-leading aerospace sector\".

The British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) said it had received phone calls in the early hours of Saturday morning from worried Flybe staff. But the union's leader, Martin Chalk, said there were jobs \"out there\". EasyJet said it had 250 vacancies for cabin crew. Ryanair posted a message on the careers section of its website saying that it had vacancies in all categories, including pilots, engineers and ground staff.  \"Of course there is upset and concern,\" said Mr Chalk, Balpa general secretary. Some staff had already been through a similar experience when Flybe collapsed three years ago, he said. When this happened, the airline shed 2,000 staff and then relaunched in April last year. \"The advantage is, this time around, the market is somewhat more buoyant than it was, now that Covid is largely in the rear view mirror,\" said Mr Chalk. Airlines are also determined to avoid a repeat of last year's problems, when staff shortages led to thousands of flight cancellations, leaving passengers stranded and demanding compensation. Flybe has cancelled all planned flights to and from the UK after going into administration - affecting 75,000 passengers in total. Passengers have been scrambling to find alternative ways to travel. However, most Flybe staff are unlikely to be left high and dry, said airline analyst John Strickland. \"My expectation is that airlines haven't completed all their recruitment for the summer, so there will be gaps and opportunities,\" he said. Tim Jeans, board director at Cornwall Airport Newquay, told the BBC's Today programme: \"The good news is that because Flybe were so small virtually every one of their routes will be replaced certainly by this summer.  \"It's not nearly the impact it had when it went bust [for the first time] three years ago.\"   A post on Ryanair's website encouraged Flybe staff to apply for new roles with the airline.  \"[Ryanair has] positions for all of you, across all areas of our business, including flight crew, cabin crew, engineers, ground staff and office staff,\" it said. EasyJet said it was not currently advertising for pilots, but would encourage Flybe cabin crew to apply for the 250 vacancies it has at Gatwick and Luton airports. Flybe cabin crew would be fast-tracked through the recruitment process within 10 days, EasyJet said. They could start work within 10 weeks. Flybe first went into administration in March 2020, knocked off course by the pandemic, which saw almost all flights grounded. It was rescued by Thyme Opco, a firm linked to US hedge fund Cyrus Capital, and relaunched in early 2022, but as a much smaller operator. This meant many fewer jobs were at stake this time round, said airline analyst John Strickland. \"[And] it's definitely a more hopeful time for the staff,\" he said. \"The original Flybe company collapsed with around 70 aircrafts and we were just going into the industry-wide shock that Covid created.  \"Contrast with this the revived Flybe, with only around five aircrafts, going into a period when we are looking to put Covid substantially behind us, a period when airlines are optimistic about bookings.\"= Both Ryanair and EasyJet appear to be in a strong position to take on staff, he added. Ryanair has already returned to being profitable, defying the challenges of last year, and chief executive Micheal O'Leary recently told the Financial Times he sees \"no signs\" of the current economic slowdown hitting airlines. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren told the BBC his firm has experienced a bounce-back in sales, reducing its losses. Mr Strickland said Flybe had not succeeded in taking advantage of the return in travel demand, due to stiff competition, rising fuel prices and because the airline lacked \"a clear and defensible business strategy, given that regional flying is the toughest segment to be in\". Balpa's Mr Chalk said he would like to work with the sector and the government to try to ensure there was a more stable market, rather than \"the churn\" of companies picking up staff from each other.",

            "text": "Airbus's celebration of Indigo's massive order for the A320 NEO - which at $49.5bn is its biggest ever single deal - will be muted.  The Dubai show has shown up the sharply contrasting fortunes at each end of the European plane maker's product range.  Its smallest plane, the A320, is selling like hot cakes. It can't make them fast enough.  The largest plane, the superjumbo A380, can't find a buyer. Airbus can't make them slowly enough. As always with aerospace, where it takes decades to know the final verdict on big decisions, the roots of the current dilemma go back years.  Airbus launched the A320 in 1984, a big bet on toppling Boeing's 737, then the workhorse of airline fleets. It has been an astonishing success, matching the 737 for sales and dividing the short-haul market roughly in half.  Airbus has made more than 7,000 A320s, with about another 6,000 on order. With the A320 established, Airbus knew it had to tackle the other end of the market, which Boeing had to itself with the 747 - the ubiquitous jumbo jet.  The A380 was the answer.  Boeing, unsurprisingly, claimed there was no market for such a large aircraft, arguing that the aviation market was shifting away from big planes taking passengers between big hub airports, to smaller, more economical aircraft flying point-to-point. Boeing looks - as things stand - to have been right.   Emirates is now nearly the only customer for the A380, using it to feed its megahub in Dubai.  It would buy more, but it wants Airbus to provide a guarantee that it will keep making the plane even if other buyers don't materialise.  Emirates doesn't want to be left with an orphan fleet. Analysts expect Airbus eventually to come to the party, as it has little choice.  It faces a big battle to make the A380 anything like the success of the A320 - but it can at least console itself with having dealt a mortal blow to the 747, which is slowly being withdrawn from passenger service.",

            "text": "Underwater sound waves could be used to help locate planes that go missing at sea, research has found. Wanting to learn about the fate of the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, a team from Cardiff University developed a method using underwater microphones to pinpoint the time and location that objects fall into the ocean. They located two \"weak signals\" on the MH370's flight path in 2014. But they cannot say if they have any association with the missing aircraft. The Boeing 777 aircraft had 239 people on board and was travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March 2014 when air traffic control lost contact. A 52 day surface search covered an area of several million square miles in the Indian Ocean west of Australia, before an underwater search mapped 274,000 square miles (710,000 sq km) of seabed at depths of up to 20,000ft (6,000m). But it failed to uncover the fate of flight and the search was suspended in January. The team at Cardiff University developed a method using the measurement of acoustic gravity waves (AGWs) which occur naturally and move through the deep ocean. When objects hit the sea surface they cause a sudden change in water pressure which leads to the generation of AGWs. The team said as well as helping to find missing planes, it could be used to locate meteorites and satellites, as well as underwater explosions, landslides or the epicentres of earthquakes at sea. Using their method, they found two \"remarkably weak signals\" from an unknown source in the Indian Ocean around the time of the MH370's disappearance.  But Dr Davide Crivelli from the university's school of engineering could not say \"with any real certainty\" if they have any association with the MH370.   \"All of this information has been passed on to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau and we anticipate that both now, and in the future, this new source of information could be used in conjunction with a whole host of other data,\" he said.  Dr Usama Kadri from the university's school of athematics, described it as a \"completely novel way of locating objects impacting on the sea surface\". \"Tracking these acoustic gravity waves opens up a huge range of possibilities, from locating falling meteorites to detecting landslides, snowslides, storm surges, tsunamis and rogue waves,\" he said.

            "text": "A Greek man says he missed the Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed in Addis Ababa after arriving two minutes late at the boarding gate. \"I was mad because nobody helped me to reach the gate on time,\" said Antonis Mavropoulos as he recalled his \"lucky day\". A second man also says he narrowly missed the flight. The Boeing plane to Nairobi crashed six minutes after taking off on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board. The victims are from more than 30 countries, including 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, and seven Britons. Mr Mavropoulos, president of the non-profit International Solid Waste Association, said he was initially angry as staff had not helped him and he missed the flight. \"I had a 30 minute connection and my flight arrived on time. My connection ambassador came after I left the plane,\" he said of the company employee that was supposed to take him to his next flight.  \"He was trying to find me. I would like to say many thanks to this ambassador who saved my life. My luggage was on me and they didn't need to wait for me. I saw the last passengers in the corridor,\" he told the BBC. Earlier, in a Facebook post entitled \"My lucky day,\" Mr Mavropoulos said he was put onto the next flight to Nairobi and only found out about the crash when he was stopped from boarding his next flight.  He was taken to a police station for questioning when an officer told him that he was the only passenger booked on the flight that did not board.  With a picture of his boarding pass, Mr Mavropoulos wrote: \"The officer told me not to protest but to pray to God.\" Police cross checked his identity and questioned him on his reason for not boarding the aircraft.  \"The wi-fi in the airport was cut and I was worried that the news might be on the Greek internet and TV. I texted friends as I didn't want my family to be devastated,\" he said.  \"My friend told me the plane had crashed. I decided to call my family to let them know from me.\" Mr Mavropoulos was reportedly travelling to Nairobi to attend a session of the UN Environment Programme.  He said that many of his friends travelling to the conference were on the flight.  \"I had friends who were travelling and were lost. Everyone at the conference is devastated. It's a very sad moment for all of us. It can happen to anyone. It was randomness.\" At least 19 victims were affiliated with the United Nations. He said: \"I'm grateful to live and that I have so many friends that made me feel their love.\" Dubai resident Ahmed Khalid said he had missed the connecting flight due to a delay in the first leg of his trip. He was then put on a later flight to Nairobi.  \"Everyone was asking the cabin crew what was happening, but no one was saying anything,\" he told The National newspaper. \"They were just going up and down until one of the passengers saw on his mobile that the first plane which had just flew, like six minutes after it flew, it just crashed.\" His father, who was waiting for him in Nairobi, heard the news and immediately thought his son was on the flight.  He said: \"I was shocked but shortly after, my son contacted me and told me he is still in Addis and did not board that flight.\"",

            "title": "MH17 plane crash: Investigators 'expected to name four suspects'",
            "text": "Investigators probing the downing of a Malaysia Airlines jet in eastern Ukraine in which 298 people died in 2014 are expected to name suspects. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) will present new evidence and announce charges for the first time. Relatives of those killed on the plane said they had been told that four men would be charged with murder. Passenger flight MH17 was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down over conflict-hit Ukraine. Investigators blame Russian-backed separatists who they say targeted the plane with a Russian-made missile. The Boeing 777 crashed in rebel-held eastern Ukraine on 17 July 2014, at the height of the conflict between government troops and separatists. Russia has denied any involvement and has maintained the missile was fired from Ukrainian-held territory. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the BBC on Wednesday that Russia had been given \"no chance to take part\" in the official investigation.  Asked whether Russia would hand any suspects over for trial, Mr Peskov said Moscow's position was \"very well known\", but declined to comment further.  Dutch investigators will hold a press conference at 13:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Wednesday after briefing relatives of victims. Relatives who were briefed before the press conference said three Russians and a Ukrainian would be charged with murder ahead of a trial in March 2020.  They told reporters the men included ex-rebel leader Igor Girkin, also known as Igor Strelkov. Kateryna Zelenko, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's foreign ministry, said earlier that \"the guilt of the four suspects must be proved first and foremost in court\". The JIT, which seeks to try the suspects under Dutch law, has previously said it had a \"long list\" of persons of interest and appealed for witness help. On Friday, prosecutors announced the release of new findings, prompting widespread reports in Dutch media that suspects will be named.  On Wednesday, internet open source investigators Bellingcat released a new report into the crash further detailing its assessment of individuals it alleges were involved in the transportation of a Buk missile used in the downing of MH17. Among the 12 people named are Igor Girkin, the former military leader of pro-Russian rebels in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, and separatist leader Igor Bezler, who was previously identified in voice recordings of phone conversations that took place shortly after the plane was shot down. In earlier reports, the Bellingcat team has alleged that a military intelligence colonel in the rebel-held Donetsk area known as Khmuryi (gloomy) and a military intelligence official commanding Russian-backed separatists in Luhansk who went by the codename of Orion were also involved. Hans de Borst, whose 17-year-old daughter Elsemiek was on board flight MH17, told the BBC's Anna Holligan that he hoped investigators would expose the truth and that naming suspects would be a \"first real step towards justice\".   Silene Fredriksz, who lost her son Bryce, said that in the five years since the tragedy, some relatives had died not knowing the truth. \"I hope the trial starts within one or two years. We all get older... I hope that I will know the truth before I close my eyes.\" MH17 left Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport at 10:15 GMT on 17 July 2014 and was due to arrive at Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia the following day. About four hours after take-off, the plane lost contact with air traffic control about 50km (30 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. The plane crashed in the Donetsk area, in territory controlled by separatists. Parts of the wreckage were found distributed over an area of about 50 sq km.  In October 2015 the Dutch Safety Board concluded the plane had been hit by a Buk missile, causing it to break apart in mid-air.  In 2016, the JIT - which includes officials from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - reached a similar conclusion.  The Dutch-led team concluded in May 2018 that the missile system belonged to the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, based in the western Russian city of Kursk. It produced evidence it said proved how the missile system reached Ukraine.  Russia responded by denying any of its anti-aircraft missile systems had ever crossed the Ukrainian border. Its foreign ministry has accused the JIT investigation of being \"biased and politically motivated\". Australia and the Netherlands have both officially held Russia responsible for the crash. A total of 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members were killed on the flight.  Delays and difficulties in the recovery of victims' remains in the crash aftermath prompted widespread international criticism. ",

            "text": "There is a \"body of information\" to suggest an Iranian surface-to-air missile brought down a Ukrainian passenger plane that crashed near Tehran, PM Boris Johnson has said. Four Britons were among the 176 people who died in the crash shortly after take-off on Wednesday, the PM added. Mr Johnson said information suggests the plane was shot down but \"this may well have been unintentional\". Iran dismissed the suggestions that it was to blame as \"US propaganda\". Tehran has ruled out a missile strike by its air defences. The crash came just hours after Iran carried out missile strikes on two airbases housing US forces in Iraq. The air strikes were in retaliation for the US killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. On Friday morning the Foreign Office hardened its travel advice for Iran for the second time in a week. It now advises against all travel to Iran and against all air travel \"to, from and within the country\".  It was previously reported that three British nationals - including two engineers and an owner of a local dry cleaning business - had died in Wednesday's plane crash. No 10 confirmed a fourth also died. Also on board were 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians, 10 Swedes, four Afghans and three Germans. Mr Johnson's comments came after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had seen evidence that suggested Iran's missiles brought down the Boeing 737-800 - which was operated by Ukrainian International Airlines on flight PS752. Mr Trudeau called for a full and thorough investigation into the crash. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he agreed with the Canadians' assessment. Speaking in Canada, he said: \"The Iranian regime must open up to the international community, including access to the crash site, so we can get to the truth as quickly as possible to give the families of the victims an understanding of what happened to their loved ones.\" \"Let us not forget the Iranian families because they have suffered the greatest loss of life in this terrible incident and they deserve to know the truth too.\" US President Donald Trump also said on Thursday he had \"suspicions\" about what happened to the plane. In a statement on Thursday, Mr Johnson said the UK government was working closely with Canada and other international partners affected by the crash and that \"there now needs to be a full, transparent investigation\". \"It is vital that there should be an immediate and respectful repatriation of those who've lost their lives to allow their families to grieve properly,\" he said. \"The UK continues to call on all sides urgently to deescalate to reduce tensions in the region.\" An Iranian official told the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner that reports the plane was shot down by an Iranian missile were \"US propaganda\". \"Their claim without providing hard evidence to international community is worthless,\" the official said.  \"If they have any evidence, they simply can share it with international bodies before making such noise and efforts to shape public opinion for their further acts against Iran.\" Meanwhile, concerns have been raised for Britons detained in Iran, amid the growing tensions.  The wife of Anoosheh Ashoori, a British-Iranian dual national who has been in jail for more than two years over espionage charges which he denies, called on the UK government to do more to protect her husband.  Sherry Izadi said she was worried there could be a backlash against foreign prisoners and that when she spoke to her husband two days ago he asked her to record a message telling her how much he loved her in case he didn't get another chance to do so.  \"When he said that it really clicked in my mind that they must be so worried to leave a message that sounds like a last message,\" she told BBC Breakfast.  Tributes have been paid to three British men who have already been named as being on board the plane. The fourth British national has not yet been named. Mohammed Reza Kadkhoda Zadeh, 40, ran a neighbourhood dry cleaners in Hassocks, West Sussex, and had a nine-year-old daughter. He was described as a hardworking man who was good at his job and loved by staff. BP engineer Sam Zokaei, 42, from Twickenham, was also among the passengers after being on holiday. A friend described him as \"always smiling and full of positive energy\" and who \"loved travelling to interesting far out places.\" Also killed was PhD student Saeed Tahmasebi, 35, who worked as an engineer for Laing O'Rourke in Dartford. Last year, Mr Tahmasebi - whose full name was Saeed Tahmasebi Khademasadi - married his Iranian partner, Niloufar Ebrahim, who was also listed as a passenger on the plane.",

            "text": "An American Airlines mechanic has been charged with damaging an aircraft in July as he was allegedly \"upset\" over stalled union contract negotiations. The plane, with 150 people on board, was scheduled to fly from Miami to Nassau in the Bahamas on 17 July.  But it aborted take-off after the pilots received an error message about the flight computer. Upon inspection, a piece of foam was found glued inside a navigation system part which stopped it from functioning. Suspect Abdul-Majeed Marouf Ahmed Alani told police he had tampered with the system to cause a delay or have the flight cancelled so that he would get overtime work, according to a criminal complaint filed in a Miami court. He did not intend to cause any harm to either the plane or the passengers, he is quoted as saying in an affidavit included in the complaint. According to the complaint filed on Thursday, Mr Alani glued the foam inside the tube leading from the outside of the plane to its air data module, a system that reports aircraft speed, pitch and other critical flight data, the Miami Herald reports. He was upset at the stalled contract dispute between the union and American Airlines, which he said had affected him financially, according to the complaint. The mechanics' union has been trying to secure a new contract with the airline as the company outsources more maintenance jobs in a bid to curb costs. A federal court last month issued a permanent injunction against the union to stop it from interfering in the airline's operations. American accuses the mechanics of undertaking illegal work slowdowns over the summer period which led to flights being cancelled. Mr Alani is expected to appear in federal court in Miami on Friday.",

            "text": "An Irish man is among the 157 people who died after an Ethiopian Airlines jet crashed shortly after take-off from Addis Ababa. The airline said 149 passengers and eight crew members were on flight ET302 from the Ethiopian capital to Nairobi in Kenya on Sunday. Michael Ryan, a father of two living in Cork but originally from County Clare, was among the victims. He had worked as an engineer with the United Nations World Food Programme. In a statement, a spokesman for the organisation in Nairobi said:  \"I can confirm that Michael Ryan was on board Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 and perished, and our condolences go to his family.\" Executive Director David Beasley said seven members of the World Food Programme had lost their lives in the plane crash. On its Facebook page, Ennistymon Parish in Clare said it was in shock at the death of Mr Ryan, who was formerly from Lahinch. The airline said 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, eight Americans and seven British nationals were also among the passengers. Irish President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar paid tribute to Mr Ryan and the other victims. President Higgins said:  \"I express my deep sadness for the tragic loss of so many lives in the air crash in Ethiopia and may I convey the deepest sympathy of the Irish people to all the families and communities affected. \"In particular, I wish to extend my deepest sympathies to the family of Michael Ryan, whose work in humanitarian assistance for the World Food Programme brought him onto the flight.\" Mr Varadkar said Mr Ryan had been \"doing life-changing work in Africa\", adding that his thoughts were with all those who died. The cause of the disaster is not yet clear. However, the pilot had reported difficulties and had asked to return to Addis Ababa, the airline said. Visibility was said to be good but air traffic monitor Flightradar24 reported that the plane's \"vertical speed was unstable after take-off\". An eyewitness at the scene told the BBC there was an intense fire as the aircraft hit the ground. Ethiopia has declared Monday a national day of mourning. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau said he was \"deeply saddened\" to hear of the crash, adding: \"We join the international community in mourning the loss of so many lives.\" UK PM Theresa May tweeted her condolences. African Union Commission chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat expressed \"utter shock and immense sadness\" while Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said he was \"saddened\". The 737 Max-8 aircraft is relatively new to the skies, having only been in commercial use since 2017. Boeing said it was \"deeply saddened\" by the crash and offered to send a team to provide technical assistance. Another plane of the same model was involved in a crash less than five months ago, when a Lion Air flight crashed into the sea near Indonesia with nearly 190 people on board.",

            "text": "An automatic pilot has landed a plane using image-recognition artificial intelligence to locate the runway. At large airports, systems on the ground beam up the position of the runway to guide automatic systems. But in late May a new AI tool landed a small plane carrying passengers, by \"sight\" alone at Austria's Diamond Aircraft airfield. One expert said it could potentially improve flight safety. The new system, developed by researchers at the technical universities of Braunschweig and Munich, processes visual data of the runway and then adjusts the plane's flight controls, without human assistance. Because it can detect both infrared light as well as the normal visible spectrum, it can handle weather conditions such as fog that might make it difficult for the human pilot to make out the landing strip. Another advantage of the technology is it does not rely on the radio signals provided by the existing Instrument Landing System (ILS). Smaller airports often cannot justify the cost of this equipment and it can suffer from interference. The innovation might soon become part of a \"portfolio\" of systems that helped to improve flight safety, said Dr David Leslie, at the Alan Turing Institute. Battista Biggio, at the University of Cagliari, said there was a possibility that someone could attempt to sabotage the AI. This might be done by placing markings on the ground to try and trick the AI pilot into thinking a runway was present when one was not, for example. Dr Leslie said he felt the risk was minimal. \"Automation doesn't necessarily mean that the pilot would be any less in control of the flight, it could mean that they're more well supported by the technologies to land the plane,\" he said. Boeing completed a fully autonomous landing of a passenger aircraft earlier this year - but the plane was not carrying any actual human passengers at the time.",

            "text": "Families who lost relatives in fatal Boeing 737 Max air crashes are set to receive about $144,500 (\u00a3116,200) each from the company. The money comes from a $50m financial assistance fund, which Boeing announced in July.  The fund has started accepting claims, which must be submitted before 2020. Lawyers for the victims' families, many of whom are pursuing the company in court, have dismissed the fund as a publicity stunt. \"$144,000 doesn't come close to compensating any of our families or any of the families,\" said Nomaan Husain, a Texas-based attorney who is representing 15 families.   \"This is not something that is going to satisfy the families. The families really want answers.\"  The 737 Max has been grounded since March, as investigators evaluate the airplane's safety following fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, which claimed the lives of more than 340 people. Boeing in July pledged $100m to families and communities affected by the crashes.  The company later said half would be reserved for direct payments to families, with the other half set aside for education and development programmes in affected communities. Robert A Clifford, lead counsel for the Ethiopian Airlines 302 litigation, said the lack of detail at the time of the initial announcement suggested Boeing saw it primarily as a way to divert attention from the safety questions. Family members, many of whom would like to see memorials erected, continue to have questions about how the company intends to spend the other $50m, he added.  \"One of the most haunting things about an aviation disaster like this is that the families do not in many instances get anything back,\" he said.  In a statement, Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenberg called the opening of the fund to family claims an \"important step\" in the firm's efforts to help relatives of the people who died in the Boeing 737 Max 8 crashes. Participation in the fund is voluntary.  Families who submit claims will not have to waive their right to file separate lawsuits against the firm, said Kenneth R Feinberg, administrator for the financial assistance money, who has overseen the distribution of money for victims of the September 11 attacks, among other funds.",

            "text": "On Friday 19 October, 1934, the passenger plane Miss Hobart fell from the sky to the sea. Eight men, three women and a baby boy fell with her, swallowed - it's believed - by the waters of the Bass Strait that lies between Tasmania and mainland Australia. The plane's wreckage was never found.  One of those on board was a 33-year-old Anglican missionary, Rev Hubert Warren, who had been travelling to his new parish in Enfield, Sydney. His wife Ellie and four children had stayed behind, intending to follow by boat.  The reverend's last present to his eight-year-old son, David, had been a crystal radio set that the boy treasured deeply.  As a boarder at Launceston Boys' Grammar School in Tasmania, David Warren tinkered with the machine after lessons, learning what made it work. He charged friends a penny to listen to cricket matches, and within a few years was selling home-made copies at five shillings each. Young David was charismatic and a wonderful orator - a boy with star quality. His family, who were deeply religious, dreamed he would become an evangelical preacher.  But that was not to be. The gift from Rev Hubert, Man of God, had launched a love affair with Science. It would prove to be of life-saving significance. By his mid-twenties, David Warren had studied his way to a science degree from the University of Sydney, a diploma in education from Melbourne University and a PhD in chemistry from Imperial College, London.  His specialty was rocket science, and he went to work as a researcher for the Aeronautical Research Laboratories (ARL), a part of Australia's Defence Department that focused on planes.   In 1953, the department loaned him to an expert panel trying to solve a costly and distressing mystery: why did the British de Havilland Comet, the world's first commercial jet airliner and the great hope of the new Jet Age, keep crashing?  He thought it might be the fuel tanks; but there were dozens of possible causes and nothing but death and debris as evidence. The panel sat down to discuss what they knew. \"People were rattling on about staff training and pilots' errors, and did a fin break off the tail, and all sorts of things that I knew nothing about,\" Dr Warren recalled more than 50 years later. \"I found myself dreaming of something I'd seen the week before at Sydney's first post-war trade fair. And that is - what claimed to be the first pocket recorder, the Miniphon. A German device. There'd been nothing before like it\u2026\"  The Miniphon was marketed as a dictation machine for businessmen, who could sit at their desks (or on trains and planes) recording letters that would later be typed up by their secretaries. David, who loved swing music and played the clarinet, only wanted one so he could make bootleg recordings of the jazz musician Woody Herman. However, when one of his fellow scientists suggested the latest doomed Comet might have been hijacked, something clicked for him. The chances that a recorder had been on board - and survived the fiery wreck - were basically nil. But what if every plane in the sky had a mini recorder in the cockpit? If it was tough enough, accident investigators would never be this confused again, because they'd have audio right up to the moment of the crash. At the very least, they'd know what the pilots had said and heard.  The idea fascinated him. Back at ARL, he rushed to tell his boss about it. Alas, his superior didn't share his enthusiasm. Dr Warren said he was told: \"It's nothing to do with chemistry or fuels. You're a chemist. Give that to the instruments group and get on with blowing up fuel tanks.\"   David knew his idea for a cockpit recorder was a good one. Without official support, there was little he could do about it - but he couldn't get it out of his mind. When his boss was promoted, David pitched his invention again. His new superior was intrigued, and so was Dr Laurie Coombes, ARL's chief superintendent. They urged him to keep working on it - but discreetly. Since it wasn't a government-approved venture or a war-winning weapon, it couldn't be seen to take up lab time or money.  Dr Warren said the chief superintendent had cautioned him: \"If I find you talking to anyone, including me, about this matter, I will have to sack you.\" It was a sobering thought for a young man with a wife and two children. But his boss's backing extended to sneakily buying one of the precious new dictation recorders, and chalking it up as \"an instrument required for the laboratory\u2026\" Encouraged, Dr Warren wrote up his idea in a report, titled \"A Device for Assisting Investigation into Aircraft Accidents\", and sent it out across the industry.  The pilots' union responded with fury, branding the recorder a snooping device, and insisted \"no plane would take off in Australia with Big Brother listening\". That was one of his better reviews. Australia's civilian aviation authorities declared it had \"no immediate significance\", and the air force feared it would \"yield more expletives than explanations\".  Dr Warren was tempted to pack it all in. But his eldest son, Peter, says his father was stubborn, with a non-conformist streak that coloured his whole worldview.  \"He took us skiing,\" he recalls, \"but he did the skiing in washing-up gloves, because he wasn't going to pay $30 for a pair of ski gloves. He wasn't the least bit afraid. He wasn't going to wait and follow the herd at all.\"  It was in that spirit that Dr Warren took to his garage and assembled his 20-year-old radio parts. He'd decided the only way to overcome his critics' mockery and suspicion was to build a solid prototype.  It would be the first ever \"black box\" flight recorder.  One day in 1958, when the little flight recorder had been finished and finessed, the lab received an unusual visitor. Dr Coombes, the chief superintendent, was showing round a friend from England.  \"Dave!\" he said, \"Tell him what you're doing!\" Dr Warren explained: his world-first prototype used steel wire to store four hours of pilot voices plus instrument readings and automatically erased older records so it was reusable.  There was a pause, then the visitor said: \"I say Coombes old chap, that's a damn good idea. Put that lad on the next courier, and we'll show it in London.\" The courier was a Hastings transport aircraft, making a run to England. You had to know somebody pretty powerful to get a seat on it. Dr Warren wondered who this man was who was giving away tickets round the world to somebody he'd never met.  The answer was Robert Hardingham (later Sir Robert), the secretary of the British Air Registration Board and a former Air Vice-Marshal in the RAF. In David's words: \"He was a hero. And he was a friend of Coombes, and if he gave away a seat, you took it.\" A few weeks later, Dr Warren was on a plane bound for England - with strict instructions not to tell Australia's Department of Defence what he was really doing there, because \"somebody would frown on it\". In a near-unbelievable irony, the plane lost an engine over the Mediterranean.  Dr Warren recalled: \"I said, 'Chaps, we seem to have lost a donk - does anyone want to go back?' But we'd come from Tunisia and it was about 45 degrees overnight. We didn't want to go back to that hellhole.\" They decided they could make it if they ploughed on. He recorded the rest of the flight, thinking that even if he died in that limping transport plane, \"at least I'd have proved the bastards wrong!\" \"But unfortunately we didn't prang - we just landed safely\u2026\"  In England, Dr Warren presented \"the ARL Flight Memory Unit\" to the Royal Aeronautical Establishment and some commercial instrument-makers. The Brits loved it. The BBC ran TV and radio programmes examining it, and the British civil aviation authority started work to make the device mandatory in civil aircraft. A Middlesex firm, S Davall and Sons, approached ARL about the production rights, and kicked off manufacturing.  Though the device started to be called \"the black box\", the first ones off the line were orange so they'd be easier to find after a crash - and they remain so today. Peter Warren believes the name dates from a 1958 interview his father gave the BBC. \"Right at the end there was a journalist who referred to this as a 'black box'. It's a generic word from electronics engineering, and the name stuck.\" In 1960, Australia became the first country to make cockpit voice recorders mandatory, after an unexplained plane crash in Queensland killed 29 people. The ruling came from a judicial inquiry, and took a further three years to become law.  Today, black boxes are fire-proof, ocean-proof and encased in steel. And they are compulsory on every commercial flight. It's impossible to say how many people owe their lives to data captured in the death throes of a failing plane - to the flaws exposed, and the safety innovations that followed. David Warren worked at ARL until his retirement in 1983, becoming its principal research scientist. He died on 19 July, 2010, at the age of 85.  For more than 50 years, his pioneering work on the black box went almost unacknowledged. Finally in 1999, he was awarded the Australian Institute of Energy Medal, and then in 2002 was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for his service to the aviation industry.  Asked why it took so long for him to be recognised, his daughter Jenny observes: \"His battle was inertia. He had this huge enquiring mind, scientifically visionary, and could see how it would work - how it would play out.  \"He was sitting there in 1958, saying 'this device can make this happen.'\" Peter Warren blames \"a 1950s colonial mindset which said nothing good could come out of this country, and everything good would get invented in either the UK, or Germany or America\". The historic secrecy surrounding ARL's work, which is now more widely understood, is another likely factor. Dr Warren lived to see Qantas name an Airbus A380 after him in 2008. Jenny Warren says she's been trying to get a seat on it ever since. But he never saw a penny in royalties from the black box.  He was often asked if he felt hard done by. Peter says his standard response was: \"Yes, the government got the results of what I did. But then, they also didn't charge me for the other hundred ideas that didn't work.\"  David's children inherited his sense of humour.  At Peter's urging, Dr Warren's death notice included his personal catchphrase: \"I'm a lucky bastard.\" At Jenny's request, he was buried in a casket labelled: \"Flight Recorder Inventor: Do Not Open.\" Do they think of their dad when flying? His daughter replies simply: \"Every time.\"",

            "title": "UK's Sabre space plane engine tech in new milestone",
            "text": "UK engineers developing a novel propulsion system say their technology has passed another key milestone. The Sabre air-breathing rocket engine is designed to drive space planes to orbit and take airliners around the world in just a few hours. To work, it needs to manage very high temperature airflows, and the team at Reaction Engines Ltd has developed a heat-exchanger for the purpose. This key element has just demonstrated an impressive level of performance. It has shown the ability to handle the simulated conditions of flying at more than three times the speed of sound. It did this by successfully quenching a 420C stream of gases in less than 1/20th of a second. The REL group is confident its \"pre-cooler\" technology can now go on to show the same performance in conditions that simulate flying above five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5. That would mean rapidly dumping the energy in a 1,000-degree airflow.  \"We're now able to prove many of the claims we've been making as a business, backed up by very high-quality data,\" REL's CEO Mark Thomas told BBC News. \"In this most recent experiment, we've near-instantaneously transferred 1.5 Megawatts of heat energy - the equivalent of 1,000 homes' worth of heat energy.\"  The testing was conducted at a dedicated facility at the Colorado Air and Space Port in the US. Sabre can be thought of as a cross between a jet engine and a rocket engine. At slow speeds and at low altitude, it would behave like a jet, burning its fuel in a stream of air scooped from the atmosphere. At high speeds and at high altitude, it would then transition to full rocket mode, combining the fuel with a small supply of oxygen the vehicle had carried aloft. The early air-breathing approach would deliver substantial weight savings, and allow a space plane, for example, to go straight to orbit without throwing away propellant stages on the way up, as rockets do now. But the concept brings with it an immense heat challenge. The faster the flow of air into the engine's intake during the high-speed ascent, the higher the temperature. And the heat would rise still further once the flow was slowed and compressed prior to entering the combustion chambers. Such conditions would ordinarily melt the insides of the engine. Sabre's pre-cooler seeks to solve this problem by efficiently, and swiftly, extracting the heat by first passing the intake gases through a tightly packed array of fine tubing. This tubing is fed with chilled helium. In 2012, REL put the pre-cooler in front of a viper jet engine and sucked ambient air through the heat-exchanger. The gas stream immediately dropped to minus-150C. Now, the company has flipped the set-up, putting the jet engine from an old F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber in front of the pre-cooler to drive hot gases directly across the piping array.  The completed Colorado experiment replicates the thermal conditions corresponding to flight at Mach 3.3, the record-breaking speed at which the American SR-71 Blackbird spy plane used to operate. Importantly, though, the pre-cooler took out all the heat. \"This technology has wide application, not just in the immediate, obvious domain of high-speed flight but across the aerospace industry more generally, and into more commercial applications - anywhere there's a significant heat-management challenge and you're looking for ultra-lightweight, miniaturised, high-performance solutions,\" Mr Thomas said. The Colorado tests continue. Meanwhile, back in England, REL is progressing towards a demonstration of the core part of the engine, expected to get under way next year. This core combustion section recently passed its preliminary design review under the eye of propulsion experts at the European Space Agency. Esa has been brought in by the UK government to act as a technical auditor on the project. The Oxfordshire company is developing Sabre with the support of BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce and Boeing. All are keen to see the many years of refinement on the engine concept finally come to fruition. Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

            "title": "Rwanda asylum policy: Deportee says plan would have deterred him",
            "text": "One of seven asylum seekers taken off Tuesday's cancelled Rwanda flight says he would not have come to the UK if he had known about the deportation policy. But the man, who can only be identified as KN, told the BBC he had been in hiding and did not know about the plan. The Iraqi Kurd, who said he fought alongside the British in the Iraq war, also alleged he had been mistreated on the way to the plane. The Home Office said staff were trained in the appropriate use of force. The Rwanda asylum plan, announced by the government in April, intends to take some asylum seekers who cross the Channel to the UK on a one-way ticket to Rwanda to claim asylum there instead.  The government has said the scheme will discourage others from crossing the Channel. KN said he had \"absolutely no idea\" that anyone entering the UK illegally to claim asylum could be deported to Rwanda under the UK government's new policy. \"If I had known about this whole plan I would have never decided to come to the UK,\" he told Radio 4's The World Tonight. \"The thing is that during the past six months, because I was in hiding, I was completely disconnected from the news and the outside world - so I had no idea what was going on. I was just desperately trying to get my way out for my safety.\" However, migrants in Calais waiting to make the crossing to the UK have previously told the BBC the plan to deport people to Rwanda would not deter them. After the first flight scheduled to take asylum seekers to Rwanda was grounded on Tuesday due to legal challenges, KN - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was taken to an immigration detention centre he describes as \"like a prison\". Speaking through an interpreter from the detention centre, he said when he learned he was being transported to the east African country, he informed British officials that he had been part of the Kurdish Peshmerga forces who had helped the UK in Iraq in 2004. He said he had documentary evidence on his phone and had told the officials: \"I really needed this favour to be returned.\" A financial problem in his home country had led to threats from \"people connected to the ruling system\", KN said, which meant his life was in danger. He fled to Turkey and found a group of people smugglers. Armed with guns and knives, they transported him hidden in a lorry to the coast of France, before loading him into a small boat. When he learned that he was due to be on the first plane-load of asylum seekers to be transported to Rwanda, KN said he called his children back home: \"They were crying, I was crying too.\" He said he was \"extremely mistreated\" by staff during the attempted removal. \"I could barely breathe. At some point I collapsed. My hands and my knees were completely numb,\" he said. KN said he was taken to a doctor and offered \"some pills\", but he refused. Security guards pushed him and bundled him into a van, he said. A Home Office spokesperson said: \"Our staff and escorting providers are rigorously trained to ensure the safety of returnees throughout the removal process, including on the appropriate use of force and restraint.\" The news that he was being transported to east Africa \"felt like I was dying\", KN said. He said: \"It was a horrible feeling. I told the security forces I am here to pursue my rights, I have the right to have a better life.\"  But after a decision by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and a series of judgements in London courts, KN was among the asylum seekers who were removed from the plane on Tuesday evening - before the flight was cancelled altogether. He said he learned of his reprieve at about 22:00 BST.  \"I started crying,\" he said. \"I told them I'm just crying for the others who were inside the plane and destined for Rwanda, because those people are helpless, are desperate just like me - they have families to support.\" With the High Court due to hear a judicial review challenging the legality of the Rwanda deportation policy next month, KN said he does not know what his future holds. \"I'm still under shock but they are refusing to let me out of this place they are keeping us,\" he said.  Although Home Secretary Priti Patel has suggested that work would begin immediately on preparing another flight, KN said the asylum seekers have heard nothing about it. He said they are \"hanging in the balance\". \"We are all in a state of shock and disbelief - we don't know what's happening next,\" he said.",

            "text": "Plans to buy new military equipment - including warships and jets - could be under threat, as MPs expressed \"serious doubts\" over whether the Ministry of Defence can afford them. The Commons Defence Select Committee says the department will struggle to find the \u00a37.3bn in savings required to pay for the new hardware. It said the MoD had proved \"incapable\" of making such savings in the past. The MoD said it was making \"good progress\" on its efficiency target. This latest report echoes a warning from January of this year from government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office. The cross-party committee of MPs backed the findings of the NAO that the defence equipment plan was at \"greater risk\" than at any time since 2012. In 2016, the government pledged to spend \u00a3178bn on new military equipment over the next 10 years. But that is on the assumption it can also find \u00a37.3bn of efficiency savings - on top of \u00a37.1bn previously announced -  by selling off property and other efficiencies. The committee chairman, Conservative MP Julian Lewis, said this was now \"extremely doubtful\" from an \"already stretched budget\". \"This will inevitably lead either to a reduction in the numbers of ships, aircraft and vehicles or to even greater delays in their acquisition,\" he added. But the MoD said that in the face of \"intensifying threats\", its \u00a3178bn equipment plan \"continues to deliver the cutting-edge kit to keep the UK safe\". The new equipment covered by the plan includes eight Type 26 frigates for the Royal Navy, new mechanised infantry vehicles and nine Boeing P-8A maritime patrol aircraft. The committee also called for clarity on the \"difference between genuine improvements and efficiency\" and cuts to \"personnel, equipment and capability\". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has already been warned of a Tory revolt over cuts to army numbers and naval capability, and suggested he will be asking the chancellor for more money. The Cabinet Office is currently carrying out a defence and security review which is due to report by the end of the year.",

            "text": "It's difficult not to be a bit overwhelmed by the Airbus campus in Toulouse. It is a huge site and the workplace for 28,000 staff, plus hundreds of visitors eager to see the planes being built. The enormous Beluga cargo plane is parked at a loading dock, ready to transport vehicles and satellites around the world.  Close to where we conduct our interviews is the hangar where the supersonic passenger jet Concorde was developed. This site is also home to much Airbus research and development, including the recently finished Project Dragonfly - an experiment to extend the ability of the autopilot. Over the past 50 years automation in aviation has transformed the role of the pilot. These days pilots have a lot more assistance from tech in the cockpit.  Project Dragonfly, conducted on an Airbus A350-1000, extended the plane's autonomy even further. The project focused on three areas: improved automatic landing, taxi assistance and automated emergency diversion. Perhaps the last of those is the most dramatic.  Malcolm Ridley, Chief Test Pilot of Airbus's commercial aircraft, reassured us that the risk of being involved in an air accident is \"vanishingly small\". However, aircraft and crew need to be ready for any scenario, so Project Dragonfly tested an automatic emergency descent system. The idea is this technology will take over if the pilots need to focus on heavy decision-making or if they were to become incapacitated.  Under its own control, the plane can descend and land, while recognising other aircraft, weather and terrain. The system also allows the plane to speak to air traffic control over the radio with a synthetic voice created through the use of artificial intelligence.  It is a lot for the plane's systems to take on.  One of the challenges was teaching the system to understand all of the information and create a solution, says Miguel Mendes Dias, Automated Emergency Operations Designer.  \"The aircraft needs to, on its own, recover all the information. So it needs to listen for the airport messages from air traffic control.  \"Then it needs to choose the most suitable airport for diversion,\" he said.  Project Dragonfly performed two successful emergency descents. During the test flights, French air traffic controllers fully understood the situation and the aircraft landed safely.  \"It was really an amazing feat,\" says Mr Mendes. Thankfully, almost all landings are much less dramatic, and Project Dragonfly looked at the more usual kind as well.  Most big airports have technology which guides the aircraft on to the runway, called precision approach.  But not every airport in the world has that tech, so Airbus has been looking at a different way to land.  Project Dragonfly explored using different sensors to help an aircraft make an automated landing. It included using a combination of normal cameras, infrared and radar technology. The team also gathered data from around the world, so all sorts of weather conditions could be modelled. As well as giving the plane more information, the extra sensors give the pilot extra clarity, when monitoring the landing. For example, infrared cameras are useful in cloudy conditions, as the closer you get to objects the more heat an infrared sensor can pick up. The tech \"will make the pilot comfortable in the fact that he's really aligned and on the good path to go to the runway,\" says Nuria Torres Mataboch, a computer vision engineer on the Dragonfly project. Project Dragonfly also looked at taxiing. Although this might seem like a basic task, it can be the most challenging part of the job, especially at the world's busiest airports. In this case, the pilot was in control of the aircraft. The technology provided the crew with audio alerts. So when the aircraft came across obstacles it issued an alert. It also advised pilots on speed and showed them the way to the runaway.  \"We wanted something that would assist and reduce the pilots' workloads during the taxi phase,\" said Mr Ridley. What do pilots make of such developments? Some do not want the technology pushed too far.  \"I don't know if any pilot is particularly comfortable with the computer being the sole arbiter of whether or not a flight successfully lands,\" said Tony Lucas, president of the Australian and International Pilots Association. More technology of business: In addition, he is not convinced that self-flying planes will be able to deal with complex scenarios that come up. \"Automation can't replace the decision making of two well-trained and rested pilots on the flight deck,\" he said from his base at Sydney airport.  Mr Lucas used the example of the Boeing 737 Max, where an automated system led to two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.  Airbus is quick to point out that further automation will only be introduced when safe and that the objective is not to remove pilots from the cockpit. But could passenger planes be pilot-free one day? \"Fully automated aircraft would only ever occur if that was clearly and certainly the safe way to go to protect our passengers and crew,\" says Mr Ridley.

            "text": "An aviation company plans to run commercial flights using an electric engine that creates no carbon emissions by 2025. ZeroAvia has flown nine test flights with its hydrogen-electric engine at Cotswold Airport, near Cirencester. The only emission created by the engine is water. Sergey Kiselev, Vice-President of ZeroAvia, said the engine would help achieve \"the decarbonisation of aviation\". Many other aerospace firms are developing engines that run on hydrogen, but most are not expecting to fly commercially until 2035. So how have they done it, and could it be possible to fly without causing climate change much sooner than people had thought? The Gloucestershire-based company are moving much faster because they are not designing an entirely new aircraft.  ZeroAvia is working on the Dornier 228, a conventional 19-seater plane that has two propellers, usually powered by kerosene. One of these has been replaced by an electric engine, and the electricity is generated on-board using a hydrogen fuel cell. For the testing period, the other engine remains fuelled by kerosene, in case of failure.  But once the technology is proved, both engines will run on electricity from the hydrogen fuel cell.  Only the new engine needs to pass safety tests, and the company is working with the Civil Aviation Authority to achieve certification. Test pilot Jon Killerby flew the aircraft and told me that once airborne, they have managed without the kerosene engine. \"We can throttle right back on the conventional engine,\" he said, \"and fly purely on the hydrogen electric system, it generates enough thrust to fly the aircraft level.  \"It really is amazing how well it works.\" Hydrogen fuel cells are not new, and have been widely used in cars and trucks.  They use a chemical process called \"reverse hydrolysis\" which combines hydrogen with oxygen and creates heat, water vapour and, crucially, electricity. So the on-board engine creates no carbon dioxide, which is one of the main ways aviation currently contributes to climate change. But the process does create water vapour, similar to the so-called 'contrails' which you see trailing behind planes today. These have also been shown to contribute to global warming. Scientists are now exploring how to capture the water on-board so there are no emissions at all. And what really matters is where you get your hydrogen. At Bath University, Prof Tim Mays has been studying hydrogen for thirty years. He runs the UK Hydrogen Research Hub which has just been awarded \u00a311m to explore how hydrogen can help combat climate change. He explained: \"At the moment people make it by treating natural gas with steam, which is about as unsustainable as it gets.\" But it is also possible to use electrolysis to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, using renewable electricity. \"That makes green hydrogen, which is what the aviation industry needs,\" said Prof Mays. \"It's a really serious option, because we do need to replace kerosene.\" It is not a big plane. The Dornier 228 will carry about 12 passengers with the hydrogen engine on board. It can fly about 250-310 miles (400-500km), according to Chief Commercial Officer Sergey Kiselev. That would get you from Bristol Airport to Newcastle, or London to Paris. By 2027, the company plans a larger hydrogen-electric engine which would power bigger aircraft. This could carry around 50 passengers and go nearer to 620 miles (1,000 km). \"Like all technologies, there are challenges,\" smiles Prof Mays. \"Making it, transporting it, and storing it.\" The aviation industry needs to build an entirely new infrastructure. Hydrogen production centres, a network to get the fuel to airports, storage at airports, the lot. And hydrogen is very different from conventional kerosene. Hydrogen takes up a lot of space. To carry it all manageably, the gas is compressed to 350 or 700 times atmospheric pressure. Even then, it takes up more space than kerosene. If you want to transport it as a liquid, you must first chill it to 253 degrees below zero.  So exactly where to make it, how to move it around and store it are all being examined now by airports and aerospace firms. Prof Mays put it like this: \"You can fly using hydrogen as a fuel, but it is not optimised, not super efficient yet, and the infrastructure is not there yet.\" The hangar in the Cotswold Airport is small, and far from the big research labs of Airbus, Rolls Royce and Boeing. But ZeroAvia already has orders for more than 1,500 of its first engine. Air Cahana is one, a new Californian airline with \"a mission to decarbonise aviation\". Another early customer is closer to home, the environmental entrepreneur Dale Vince, who founded renewable energy firm Ecotricity. Mr Vince is launching an airline called \"Ecojet\", which will use the ZeroAvia engines on passenger flights, at first from Edinburgh to Southampton. He said: \"The question of how to create sustainable air travel has plagued the green movement for decades.  \"The desire to travel is deeply etched into the human spirit, and flights free of C02 emissions, powered by renewable energy will allow us to explore our incredible world without harming it for the first time.\" Bigger aerospace firms are watching the small start-up with interest. Airbus has a huge research programme called ZeroE, which also uses hydrogen. The company is exploring both hydrogen fuel cells to create electricity to power propellers, and using liquid hydrogen directly for combustion.  But Airbus is aiming to have hydrogen-powered planes in the sky by 2035, a full decade later than the small ZeroAvia engines. Sergey Kiselev told me that's why they decided not to create a completely new aircraft, but instead just change the engine on an existing plane. He said: \"It helps us eliminate all the complexity with the certification of the aircraft, we can focus only on the engine. So we can get the aircraft up into the air in commercial operations, much faster.\" The company has made its pledge. It now has at least two big challenges.  One is to make its engine safe, certified, and ready to use by 2025. They are well on their way to that one. The other, harder, challenge, will be making sure there is some fresh new hydrogen waiting for the aircraft when it lands at the other end. Update 11 December 2023: A clarification has been added to say that water vapour is a greenhouse gas and how scientists are trying to capture that vapour on-board.

            "title": "Pakistan plane crash was 'human error' - initial report",
            "text": "A plane crash that killed 97 people in Pakistan last month was a result of human error by the pilot and air traffic control, according to an initial report into the disaster. They failed to follow protocol, Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said, announcing the findings in parliament. He also said the pilots were distracted while talking about coronavirus. The passenger plane came down on houses in Karachi on 22 May.  Only two passengers survived.  The passenger plane was en route from Lahore when it crashed into a residential area in Karachi, after trying to land at the city's Jinnah International Airport. Mr Khan said there was nothing wrong with the aircraft, an Airbus A320, run by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).    He said the pilot initially failed to deploy the landing gear correctly, which led to the aircraft scraping the runway before taking off again. Then, as it was about to make a second landing, air traffic controllers failed to inform the pilot that the engines had been left badly damaged, the minister reported.  \"When the control tower asked him to increase the plane's height, the pilot said 'I'll manage'. There was over-confidence,\" he said.  Mr Khan said the full investigation report would be presented in a year's time and it would include details from a recording taken during the descent.  He also promised a government \"restructuring\" of PIA, insisting action would be taken against rogue pilots. What happened on board? Purported audio of the conversation between air traffic control and a pilot for the second attempt was published shortly after the crash by Pakistani media outlets, in which the pilot is heard saying the plane has \"lost engines\".  An air traffic controller asks whether it is going to carry out a \"belly landing\", to which the pilot replies \"mayday, mayday, mayday\" - the final communication from the plane. Muhammad Zubair, one of the two surviving passengers, said there were 10-15 minutes between the first attempt at landing and the crash. \"No-one was aware that the plane was about to crash; they were flying the plane in a smooth manner,\" he said. He recalled how he lost consciousness during the sudden descent, then woke up to smoke and screaming. PIA said the plane had joined the fleet in 2014 and passed its annual airworthiness inspection last November. The crash came just days after Pakistan began allowing commercial flights to resume after coronavirus restrictions were eased. Mr Khan said the pilots were discussing the virus just before the crash, as their families had been affected.  Pakistan has a chequered aviation safety record, including a number of airliner crashes. In 2010, an aircraft operated by private airline Airblue crashed near Islamabad, killing all 152 people on board - the deadliest air disaster in Pakistani history. In 2012, a Boeing 737-200 operated by Pakistan's Bhoja Air crashed in bad weather on its approach to land in Rawalpindi, killing all 121 passengers and six crew. And in 2016, a PIA plane burst into flames while travelling from northern Pakistan to Islamabad, killing 47 people.",

The pay-out was made just before the 2016 presidential election, which Mr Trump won over Hillary Clinton. Two people familiar with the matter told the Associated Press Mr Trump is facing multiple charges of falsifying business records - including at least one felony offence, which would be a more a serious charge. \"On Tuesday morning I will be going to, believe it or not, the Courthouse,\" he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday. \"America was not supposed to be this way!\" The former president is being escorted by members of the US Secret Service and will reportedly fly to New York's LaGuardia Airport aboard his personal plane.  After spending the night in Trump Tower, where extra security measures have been put in place, he will travel to the courthouse with a large Secret Service detail and surrender voluntarily. He is not expected to be handcuffed. The former president will be fingerprinted as standard arrest procedure, and investigators will complete the usual paperwork and check for outstanding warrants. It remains unclear, however, whether he will be photographed - and provide a mugshot - before the hearing.  He will appear before a judge, who will read the indictment - the set of charges - to him. His lawyers have already said he will plead not guilty. A group of news organisations, including the New York Times and the Associated Press, have asked that cameras be allowed into the courtroom during the hearing. They have also asked the judge to unseal the indictment and make it public due to the \"overwhelming public interest\". Mr Trump is expected to be released on bail and will return to his Florida home, Mar-a-Lago, on Tuesday evening, where he plans to deliver remarks at 20:15 local time. He is the first US president in history to be charged with a crime, but has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.  The years-long investigation has been led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a registered Democrat, who Mr Trump says is leading a \"political prosecution\" aimed at damaging his run for the presidency in 2024. \"We're ready for this fight. And I look forward to moving this thing along as quickly as possible to exonerate him,\" one of his lawyers, Joe Tacopina, told ABC News on Sunday. Mr Trump's prospective court appearance comes as he faces numerous other criminal investigations.  On Monday, the Washington Post reported that federal investigators had gathered new evidence suggesting Mr Trump may have obstructed the investigation into the handling of top secret documents at Mar-a-Lago. Mr Trump denies wrongdoing.",

            "title": "Rwanda three-week removals plan revealed",
            "text": "Asylum seekers crossing the English Channel could be sent to Rwanda in as little as three weeks after their arrival, it has been claimed.  In the latest stage of a High Court legal battle over the controversial Home Office plan, opponents said the timescales were unlawful and unfair.  Charity Asylum Aid said the plan denies people a fair chance to make a case.  But the Home Office said flexible timescales would in fact allow migrants time to present all of their arguments. No flights to Rwanda have yet left - and they will not take place until the complex and huge legal battle is finished.  Last month, the High Court heard five days of arguments over whether the government had any actual power to send asylum seekers to Rwanda if they have come to the UK from a safe country, such as France. Judges are also considering the UN refugee agency's concerns and whether the UK can share the personal data of migrants with Rwanda's authorities.  In Thursday's hearing at the High Court, lawyers for Asylum Aid argued that migrants could not get a fair hearing under the accelerated timetable to list them for a flight.  After an initial screening interview in Kent, migrants would be given a \"notice of intent\" that they were being considered for the Rwanda scheme. They would then have seven days to make a case to stay in the UK - and if the Home Office later decides to send them to Rwanda instead, they would have a further five-day notice of the date of their flight.  During the hearing, Charlotte Kilroy KC, for the charity, repeatedly clashed with Lord Justice Lewis, one of the two judges hearing the case.  He repeatedly asked her to explain why seven days was procedurally unfair or unlawful, given all the migrant had to do was tell Home Office officials why they had not sought asylum in another European country, and explain why they were too vulnerable to be sent to Rwanda or had another reason to remain in the UK.  \"Whether they come on a boat or lorry, the reality is that in most cases they will be able to explain the countries they passed through,\" said the judge. \"Do they not have every opportunity [to put their case]?\" Ms Kilroy replied: \"It is not just where they have passed through but the exceptional circumstances [they may have]. \"They need to get a lawyer in order to properly explain the sorts of matters that might amount to exceptional reasons. \"The screening interview is brief and they [without proper advice] don't understand what amounts to exceptional circumstances.\" The home secretary's team say the minimum seven-day period would be \"sufficient\" in most cases - and others would get extensions so they could raise issues that officials need to examine more closely.  \"It is not an 'accelerated' process,\" said Edward Brown KC, for the government, in written submissions.  \"The process is designed to determine, without delay, the issue of admissibility and possible removal to Rwanda, whilst giving sufficient opportunity to the individual to make representations.\" The hearing continues on Friday - with the judges expected to rule within weeks on the entire plan. It is highly likely that result will then be appealed by the losing side - meaning no flights to Rwanda would take off this year. ",

            "title": "Rwanda asylum plan: UK ministers partially lose Rwanda secrecy bid",
            "text": "Ministers have partially lost an attempt to keep secret a series of comments about Rwanda from an adviser. The High Court said on Wednesday some of what the adviser had told ministers must be disclosed in a major court case over the Rwandan refugee policy. Lawyers for the government had argued disclosing the comments would damage relations with the African country. The adviser had warned ministers Rwanda's government tortured and killed political opponents, the court heard. While that warning of political violence was disclosed in court on Tuesday, further comments from the expert remain secret. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) adviser had looked at revisions to the government's own report into Rwanda's human rights record.  That document was being updated as ministers planned to send asylum seekers on a flight to Rwanda under the controversial relocation scheme announced in April.  The one-way plan, worth at least \u00a3120m to Rwanda, aims to discourage illegal crossings of the English Channel - but it is on ice until the High Court rules whether it is legal.  In court, the government said 10 further comments from the unnamed official should be kept confidential rather than be used as evidence in that forthcoming court case. This meant they would not be disclosed to the group of migrants and charities who were challenging the flights policy. But in his ruling Lord Justice Lewis said six of the official's comments, or parts of them, should feature in next month's legal battle.  He ruled four should remain entirely secret because of the damage they would do to international relations. \"I accept that disclosure of the 10 extracts would give rise to a real risk of causing serious harm to the United Kingdom's international relations, particularly with Rwanda,\" he said.  \"I recognise that the government... regards a policy whereby those seeking asylum have their claims determined in Rwanda as a significant means of deterring people from seeking to cross the English Channel in boats or by other means. \"Disclosing the material in issue in this case would undermine the development and implementation of that policy.\" However the judge said given September's major legal action had to decide whether sending asylum seekers to Rwanda was lawful, the claimants and the court needed to consider as much evidence as possible.  He said some of the official's comments would have \"evidential significance\" - and the public interest in disclosing them outweighed the government's case for keeping them secret.  Lord Justice Lewis said: \"I recognise that there is a strong public interest in not undermining international relations with a friendly state. Nonetheless, that consideration is outweighed by the public interest in ensuring access to relevant information in this litigation and by the extent to which the information is already in the public domain.\" The official's precise words are not yet in public. The government has been allowed time to consider an appeal. If the judgment stands, the comments are likely to emerge in public in September. Migrants identified for the first aborted flight, and three media organisations - BBC News, including BBC Two's Newsnight, the Times and the Guardian newspapers - sought the disclosure of the material.",

            "title": "Groundbreaking transatlantic flight using greener fuel lands in the US",
            "text": "The first transatlantic flight by a large passenger plane powered only by alternative fuels has landed in the US. Operated by Virgin Atlantic, it flew from London's Heathrow to New York's JFK airport. Airlines see the flight, which is supported by government funding, as demonstrating that a greener way of flying is possible. But a lack of fuel supply remains a challenge, while other technology will be needed to hit emissions targets. The flight was a one-off of its kind so far, and did not carry fare-paying passengers. Transport Secretary Mark Harper was one those on board and upon landing, declared: \"History has been made.\" So-called sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) can be made from a variety of sources, including crops, household waste and cooking oils. For this flight, a Boeing 787 was filled with 50 tonnes of SAF. Two types were used, with 88% derived from waste fats and the rest from the wastes of corn production in the US. Following test and analysis, the flight was approved by UK regulator the Civil Aviation Authority earlier this month. A number of companies have been involved in the project including engine-maker Rolls-Royce and energy giant BP.    The aviation industry is particularly difficult to decarbonise, but airline bosses view SAF as the most effective tool available to help bring its net emissions down to zero. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hailed Virgin Atlantic's achievement but his claim that the flight was \"net zero\" was criticised. Planes still emit carbon when using SAF, but the industry says the \"lifecycle emissions\" of these fuels can be up to 70% lower. Shai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, said the airline's flight on Tuesday was \"proving... that fossil-derived fuel can be replaced by sustainable aviation fuel\". \"It's really the only pathway to decarbonising long-haul aviation over and above having the youngest fleet in the sky,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"It is a really momentous achievement.\" However, he said there was not enough SAF currently, and added that due to the fuel being more expensive, flight prices would end up being higher.  Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson admitted it was \"going to take a while\" before there was enough SAF for everybody to use. \"But you have to start somewhere,\" he told the BBC. \"And if we didn't prove it can be done, you would never, ever get sustainable aviation fuel.\"  SAF is already used in small amounts, blended with traditional jet fuel, but accounts for less than 0.1% of the aviation fuel consumed around the world.  It currently costs more than kerosene, and relatively small amounts are made. Aircraft are usually only allowed to use up to 50% in a blend.  There are no dedicated commercial SAF plants in the UK, although the government aim is to have five under construction by 2025, supported by grant funding. Airlines see the first long-haul flight of a large passenger plane using 100% SAF as a significant milestone. But experts say such fuels are not a magic bullet. Dr Guy Gratton, associate professor of aviation and the environment at Cranfield University, said: \"We can't produce a majority of our fuel requirements this way because we just don't have the feedstocks. And even if you do, these fuels are not true 'net zeros'.\" He said the growing use of SAF had to be treated as \"a stepping stone towards future, genuinely net zero technologies\".  \"This might be e-fuels [which are manufactured using captured carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide, together with hydrogen], it might be hydrogen, it might be some technologies that we still really only have at the laboratory stage.\" The policy director of the Aviation Environment Federation campaign group, Cait Hewitt, said the idea that the flight meant the UK was closer to \"guilt-free\" flying was \"a joke\".  She said there might be better technology in the future to cut carbon emissions but, for now, the only way to achieve this was to \"fly less\". UK ministers and the industry have insisted they believe \"net zero\" by 2050 is achievable with passenger numbers increasing. Before boarding the flight, Transport Secretary Mark Harper told BBC Breakfast: \"There are those campaigners who want to tell ordinary people that they can't fly. That's their view, they're entitled to it. The government doesn't agree with them.\" He said using SAF produced about 70% less carbon emissions than traditional fuels \"so that is a really big step forward\".  \"We are also involved with supporting the industry develop hydrogen and also electric flights for shorter-haul flights, so all of that technology is being developed.\" Mr Harper acknowledged that using SAF was \"not the only solution\", but said: \"It is a really important step with those other technologies to make sure we can carry on flying and protect the environment.\" The UK government plans to require 10% of aviation fuel to be SAF by 2030.   Airlines UK, which represents UK-registered carriers, said they must be able to access enough affordable SAF to meet such a requirement, with as much as possible coming from the UK. Its boss Tim Alderslade said: \"The last thing we want is higher fuel costs for UK passengers compared to the rest of Europe and the US, with worse sustainability outcomes and thousands of new jobs lost overseas.\"",

None of the nine passengers aboard the Boeing P-8A Poseidon plane were injured in the Monday afternoon incident, authorities told US media. Pictures showed the twin-engine reconnaissance jet in the shallow waters of Kaneohe Bay. The incident took place at a time of cloud, rain and poor visibility. National Weather Service data indicates that at the time of the crash mist limited visibility to about one mile (1.6km) as wind gusts peaked at 21mph (34kmh). The P-8A Poseidon is an advanced aircraft that can cost as much as $275mil (\u00a3219mil). Carrying torpedoes and cruise missiles, the plane is often used in intelligence gathering, naval operations and anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare. The crashed plane in question is typically stationed at Whidbey Island in Washington state but had deployed to Hawaii for \"routine training\", officials said. The military, which did not provide an assessment of the possible environmental damage, surrounded the crashed aircraft with absorbent booms in an effort to keep leaking fuel from spreading, local CBS News affiliate Hawaii News Now reported.  Booms, made of spongy polypropylene, are often used to control and clean up oil spills.  Local residents raised fears that the plane had crashed on a reef that supports Hawaiian marine life.  While relieved that no one was injured, local resident Jonee Kaina said she was concerned about the effects the crash could have on the environment.  \"I think someone needs to take a look at the impact the plane is doing to our marine life,\" she told Hawaii News Now. \"There is jet fuel, anti-freeze and other toxins.\"",

Spirit Aerosystems makes the wings for the Airbus A220. The company's chief executive, Patrick Shanahan, said he thinks the two firms will come to \"a reasonable outcome\". Spirit has been in Northern Ireland since 2019 when it bought Bombardier's operations. The deal ended a long period of uncertainty for about 3,000 workers in Northern Ireland. In August, the firm reported worse than expected financial results for the second quarter of 2023. It disclosed $105m (\u00a382m) in losses on Boeing and Airbus aircraft production and forecast a difficult cashflow picture for the rest of the year. The A220 programme was among the loss-making parts of the business. At the time, then-chief executive Tom Gentile said Spirit \"made a big bet on the A220 programme\".  Spirit recently reached a deal with Boeing for the prices paid for work on the 787 Dreamliner and the 737. Mr Shanahan was speaking to financial analysts as Spirit reported its third quarter results. He said the negotiations with Airbus are very similar to the process with Boeing. \"We're committed to Airbus, and I think they're committed to us,\" he said. \"But I'm encouraged, based on the Boeing agreement, that we'll get there with Airbus,\" he told the analysts. Mr Shanahan suggested that because the A220 wings are manufactured using a novel process it had taken time to assess its true cost as production was scaled up. \"The performance that we should be realising out of the manufacturing system just isn't there, but I think it's inherently not there,\" he said.  \"Between us and Airbus, we have to come to some resolution to address that discontinuity. \"I think we'll be able to get to the place that makes sense for both parties.\"",

            "title": "Qantas boss: Governments 'to insist' on vaccines for flying",
            "text": "The boss of Australian airline Qantas has told the BBC that \"governments are going to insist\" on vaccines for international travellers. Coronavirus vaccines are seen as crucial to reviving an industry that saw worldwide passenger numbers fall 75.6% last year.  Chief executive Alan Joyce said many governments were talking about vaccination as \"a condition of entry\".  Even if they weren't, he thought the airline should enforce its own policy. \"We have a duty of care to our passengers and to our crew, to say that everybody in that aircraft needs to be safe,\" Mr Joyce said.  He believes that would justify changing the terms and conditions on which tickets are booked.  And Mr Joyce thinks passengers would be willing to accept the change. \"The vast majority of our customers think this is a great idea - 90% of people that we've surveyed think it should be a requirement for people to be vaccinated to travel internationally.\"   But some powerful voices are among those who disagree, including the World Health Organisation. Its director of digital health and innovation, Bernardo Mariano, told the BBC: \"We don't approve the fact that a vaccinations passport should be a condition for travel.\"  He added that - regardless of what the private sector wanted - a unified approach from governments would be needed to make such a change work.  Aviation is vital to the global economy. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) estimates that it supports $1.8 trillion (\u00a31.3tn, A$2.3tn) in global economic activity. But government restrictions and fears of catching coronavirus have led to an unprecedented fall in passenger numbers in an industry which carried 4.5 billion people in 2019.   Australia's government has closed its borders to almost all foreigners and has also periodically closed internal borders. Even with vaccines, Mr Joyce thinks that \"once we open up our international borders, we're going to have the virus circulating\".  \"And that's going to be a big change for a lot of Australia, to find that acceptable,\" he said. \"We need people to understand they can't have zero risk with this virus. We manage risk in so many different other ways for other parts of life.\" The lack of passengers means that in the last six months of 2020 Qantas lost $800m (\u00a3580m, A$1.03bn). That compares with a profit of $596m (\u00a3430m, A$771m) in the same period of 2019. It's also meant 8,500 job cuts from a pre-pandemic staff of about 29,000.  And thousands of others are on furlough, with the Australian government paying their wages. Other international carriers have seen similar reversals in their fortunes. In response, airlines have cut their capacity, with huge numbers of aeroplanes put into storage. For Qantas that was about two-thirds of their 314 aircraft.  Among them are the airline's fleet of giant, double-decker Airbus A380s, one of which was being refurbished when the pandemic took hold. It \"went from Dresden in Germany where the reconfig took place straight to the Mojave Desert, and nobody sat on those seats\", Mr Joyce said. Qantas says vaccines will be required to fly  Having less supply of any product normally means that prices climb in response to an increase in demand. However, Mr Joyce doesn't think the combination of fewer seats and the easing of restrictions will lead to higher prices.  \"In some cases, we think the airfares could be half of what they were pre-Covid,\" he said. \"And that will be there to stimulate demand.\" It could be that way for some time. \"Internationally it's going to take a while for it to recover to 2019 levels,\" the airline boss said. When flights do get going again, the priority will be bringing money in and any surge in demand can be dealt with by bringing more aircraft back into service.  \"So we're very confident that it's not going to be higher airfares,\" Mr Joyce insisted. Last month Qantas pushed back the date at which it expects its international flights to resume from July to the end of October. That's the point at which the Australian government hopes to have vaccinated all adults and the date for which the airline is now selling international tickets. \"The number one flight by a significant amount is Perth to London non-stop,\" says Mr Joyce. The demand for the ultra-long haul flights is, he says, \"a good indication\" that after pandemic passengers will try to avoid changeovers in airports filled with other people.  That desire to travel direct means \"the business case is probably going to be stronger\" for what Qantas calls \"Project Sunrise\".  It is likely to eventually involve direct flights \"from Sydney and Melbourne non-stop into Europe and non-stop to the east coast of  the United States\", he said. Tests have already taken place but the launch has been delayed, and is now not expected until 2024. Aviation is responsible for about 2.5% of global carbon emissions.  But Qantas claims to have the \"world's biggest airline carbon offset programme\". It is also investing $38.7m (\u00a328m, A$50m) in a partnership with BP to develop a sustainable aviation fuel industry in Australia. In addition, it said it was looking at technology such as more fuel-efficient planes as well as electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. \"I think you have to do it,\" Mr Joyce said. Spending money to cut emissions, he says, shows \"it's not just a focus on the bottom line\". \"You have to actually do the right thing by the environment, do the right thing by society. Otherwise, you don't have a social licence to operate in the future.\" To keep the finances on course during the pandemic Qantas has raised $770,000 (\u00a3560,000, A$1m) by selling bar carts that in-flight drinks were served from on its now-retired Boeing 747s, as well as wine in plastic bottles and a stock of the quintessentially Australian chocolate biscuit, Timtams.  Mr Joyce says: \"You just have to have that flexibility, that adaptability, to survive.\"  \"It's the reason why Qantas survived for 100 years\" and is the oldest continuous operating airline in the world, he said. \"That's part of our DNA. That's why we're going to survive for at the least the next 100 years.\" You can watch Alan Joyce's full interview on \"Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst\" this weekend on BBC World News at Saturday 2330 GMT,  Sunday  0530GMT, 1630 GMT,  Monday 0730 GMT, 1130 GMT and  Tuesday at 1330 GMT.",

            "text": "A massive private jet has taken to the motorway rather than skies for its journey to a new home in Bristol. The Boeing 727 was loaded on to a lorry at Cotswold Airport, Gloucestershire, on Saturday for its unusual drive down the M5, M4 and M32. The plane - 40m (131ft) in length - is being \"up-cycled\" to provide office space for a media and tech firm. Company owner Johnny Palmer said: \"It was a \u00a350m-plus aircraft. \"But the general state of airworthiness meant we got a slight discount from that price.\" The decommissioned jet left the airport at about 09:00 GMT. Measuring 5m (16ft) wide and 4m (13ft) high, it had to straddle two lanes as it crept down the motorway at 20mph behind a police escort. Once at its new base in Brislington, the craft is set to be lifted with a 60m (200ft) crane on to shipping containers \"painted to look like clouds\" so it \"appears as though it is flying\". Mr Palmer, said his company, Pytch, \"needed more space\" and the plane would be the \"centrepiece of the hub\", adding: \"The aircraft was in the right place at the right time to be up-cycled. \"So rather than do resource and carbon-intensive construction, we decided to re-purpose the icon of unsustainable hyper-consumption - the airliner private jet.\" The plane originally flew in 1968 with Japan Airlines as a passenger airliner but some time in the 1970s it was converted into a VIP private aircraft.  It took its final flight to Filton Airfield in 2012, before being transported to Gloucestershire to be salvaged. \"This is by far the most expensive office space that has ever been installed in Bristol,\" said Mr Palmer. \"Or at least it would if the aircraft could fly.\"",

The advice on nappies is in a section on personal protective equipment in new guidelines for airlines. The regulator said the recommendation applied to charter flights to high-risk Covid-19 destinations. Globally, airlines and airports have been making big changes to how they operate to get passengers flying again. The Civil Aviation Administration of China laid out its advice in a new 49-page set of guidelines for airlines to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The recommendation on nappies applies to charter flights to and from places where infections exceed 500 in every one million people.  It comes on top of the advice for cabin crew to wear medical masks, disposable gloves, caps, goggles, disposable protective clothing and shoe coverings. Flight crew are also advised to wear a range of protective gear, but not nappies. The global aviation industry has been struggling to rebound from the pandemic's debilitating impact on travel. New measures being put in place for flights differ by country. Some require airlines to leave at least one seat empty between passengers, others have made masks mandatory for the duration of flights.",

            "text": "Southampton City Council has objected to revised plans to expand the runway at the city's airport. The airport wants to to lengthen the runway by 164m (538ft) to increase the number of flights and allow the use of larger planes. The council voted to oppose the scheme on the grounds of climate change and noise levels. The Business South group told the meeting the extension was \"essential for the future\". The city council had previously voted to oppose the airport's original plans in January. Southampton Airport has since amended the proposals and the city council was asked to confirm its position before a final decision is taken by councillors in Eastleigh - where the airport is located. The latest plans allow the local authority to set a maximum cap on the noise level and would give affected residents grants for insulation, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Managing director at Southampton Airport Steve Szalay previously said the airport's future would be in doubt if it was not allowed to extend the runway to accommodate planes such as the Airbus 320 and Boeing 737. Passenger numbers at the airport have fallen by 89% this year. Lyn Bryshaw, from the Airport Expansion Opposition group told the online council meeting the development would \"cause huge harm to the environment and local people\"  \"The economic benefits for Southampton and the region have been overstated and no evidence at all has been presented to suggest that the airport would go out of business without the extension.\" Tim Hancock, chair of Business South, said: \"The business community supports the Southampton Airport runway application.  \"The certainty of the planning permission is essential for the future.\" Leader of the opposition Conservative group Dan Fitzhenry said the expansion was \"crucial\" for the local economy. Lisa Mitchell, chair of the planning and rights of way panel said she was \"not satisfied\" with the efforts to limit the impact on climate change and noise levels. A decision on planning permission is due to be made on 17 December.",

            "text": "The European Union is moving forward with a plan to hit $4bn (\u00a33bn) of American goods with tariffs as punishment for US subsidies for Boeing. The taxes, authorised by the World Trade Organization last month, go into effect on Tuesday and affect items such as tractors, ketchup and orange juice. The EU said it still hoped to settle the fight, which saw the US impose tariffs on European products last year. A trade official said Joe Biden's election could help \"reboot\" talks.  EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said the EU wanted to see both sides remove their respective tariffs, which are a result of a long-running feud over state support provided to plane-maker Boeing and European rival Airbus.  \"Removing these tariffs is a win-win for both sides, especially with the pandemic wreaking havoc on our economies,\" said Mr Dombrovskis. \"We now have an opportunity to reboot our transatlantic co-operation and work together towards our shared goals.\" US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has served as America's top trade official under Donald Trump, said the US was \"disappointed\" by the move. \"The alleged subsidy to Boeing was repealed seven months ago,\" he said in a statement. \"The EU has long proclaimed its commitment to following WTO rules, but today's announcement shows they do so only when convenient to them.\"  The fight over aircraft subsidies for Boeing and European rival Airbus pre-dates Mr Trump's time in office, but trade tensions between the two traditional allies have grown particularly strained during his tenure.  Last year, the WTO said the US was justified to retaliate against the EU on $7.5bn worth of goods for support granted to Airbus, prompting the US to place tariffs on items such as certain whiskeys, wines and cheese.  The WTO made a similar ruling in October in favour of the EU over support offered to Boeing. In recent months, both sides have taken steps they say correct the offending programmes. But Mr Dombrovskis said there had been no progress toward a settlement. \"We have made clear all along that we want to settle this long-running issue. Regrettably, due to lack of progress with the US, we had no other choice but to impose these countermeasures,\" he said. US aircraft imported to Europe will face tariffs of 15%. The EU said it would apply border taxes of 25% to a list of other items, which includes tractors, tobacco ketchup, orange juice, cheddar cheese and sweet potatoes. ",

            "title": "Rolls-Royce says 'worst behind us' as it posts \u00a34bn loss",
            "text": "Aircraft-engine maker Rolls-Royce posted a huge loss last year due to the collapse in air travel, but it told the BBC \"the worst is behind us\". Boss Warren East said 2020 had been \"unprecedented\", with the company making a loss of almost \u00a34bn, after a \u00a3583m profit the year before. Rolls makes most of its money servicing engines, and the Covid-driven fall in airline travel has slashed revenues. It has cut 7,000 jobs and raised cash from investors to bolster its finances. However, Mr East said the vaccine rollout should see a pick-up in air travel in the second half of the year, although a lot depends on getting international agreement on checking passengers' health.  The extra cash raised from shareholders was enough to see the company through the rest of the crisis, even if there was no upturn this year, he added. \"2020 was an unprecedented year... the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the group was felt most acutely by our civil aerospace business,\" Mr East said. \"In response, we took immediate actions to address our cost base, launching the largest restructuring in our recent history.\"  The Derby-based company expects to burn through another \u00a32bn cash this year as it continues to restructure the business. It has warned it may have to slash a further 2,000 jobs. But Mr East said the cuts, fundraising and disposal of assets would stabilise Rolls-Royce and set it on track for growth in the future.  \"2020 was a year like none other, but we do think the worst is behind,\" Mr East told the BBC. Rolls-Royce is also raising cash through asset sales, although that plan ran into problems this week when Norway suspended the \u20ac150m sale of Rolls' Norwegian unit, Bergen Engines, on security grounds. Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said Rolls had \"much to do\", but it was feasible. \"The possibility of reaching modest net debt by end 2023 is alive,\" he said.  Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laura Hoy said that trading in most other parts of RR also suffered, with only the defence arm showing profits growth. \"Full year results at Rolls Royce were brutal,\" she said. \"No amount of cost saving and restructuring was enough to offset massive declines in civil aerospace.  \"Defence was the only bright light, but it makes up less than 30% of overall revenue so its 8% uptick in profits was buried under heavy losses in all of the group's other segments.\" Rolls-Royce's future depends on the return of air travel, she said. \"Ultimately, Rolls needs engine hours to recover in order to stage a fully-fledged comeback.\" While Rolls-Royce has lost billions and continues to burn through cash, investors will take some limited reassurance from this set of results. Chief executive Warren East forecast that the company will turn cash positive in the second-half of this year, and that the number of hours its engines spend in the air - a vital metric as the company only earns money when planes fly - will increase this year, although only to 55% of pre-pandemic levels.  Mr East said the \u00a39bn of liquidity the company had secured, through a rights issue and extra borrowing, should be enough to see it through the next two years even if there is no aviation rebound.  The cash crunch has come at a difficult time for the aero-engine maker, which faces an urgent need to invest in cleaner forms of propulsion, including batteries and hydrogen.  At the same time it has to keep its traditional engine offering competitive, as Boeing and Airbus are likely to launch new models before the new technologies are ready. On this Mr East had some positive news - Rolls-Royce has signed a deal with Wideroe, the Scandinavian airline, for a new electric aircraft to fly regional routes. The shares up were 3% in early trading.",

            "text": "The boss of Boeing has warned that there is a \"risk\" the plane maker may be forced to axe its 737 Max 10 jet over potential regulatory issues. The company faces a deadline at the end of this year to secure approval for the passenger jet from US authorities. Chief executive Dave Calhoun said the push to get the greenlight was \"a little bit of an all-or-nothing\". The Max 10 is the latest and largest plane in the 737 family, which has been scrutinised after two fatal crashes. In an interview with Aviation Week magazine, Mr Calhoun said he still expected a favourable outcome, as Boeing planned to press its case with the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the US Congress. \"If you go through the things we've been through, the debts that we've had to accumulate, our ability to respond or willingness to see things through, even a world without the [737 Max] 10 is not that threatening,\" he said. \"I do not expect [to cancel the programme], and I don't want anybody to think that. It's just a risk,\" he added. A Boeing spokesperson confirmed Mr Calhoun's comments to the BBC. The spokesperson added that the company was committed to meeting regulators' requirements and \"those of our customers to certify and deliver the 737-10. Safety remains the driving factor in this effort\". Earlier this year, the FAA warned Boeing that it may not receive certification for the Max 10 by the end of this year. Certification is required for a plane to enter into service. If Boeing does not get approval, it would have to add an alerting system to the cockpits of the Max 10s, under regulations taking effect in 2023. That is unless it receives a waiver from the US Congress. Including the system means Boeing would have to redesign the Max 10's flight deck, and train pilots to fly under a new configuration, the BBC understands. Boeing has more than 600 Max 10 jets on order from 18 customers, including British Airways owner IAG and United Airlines. The US requirements were introduced after other models in the 737 Max line were involved in fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, in which 346 people were killed. The entire global fleet of 737 Max aircraft was grounded after the Ethiopian Airlines crash in 2019. Authorities around the world have since allowed the planes to fly again.",

            "text": "Recovery teams have found human remains at the crash site of the China Eastern jet which plunged into mountains this week, say state media. Authorities have yet to declare the number of victims, but there has been no sign so far that any of the 132 people on board had survived. Investigators still do not know why the plane suddenly entered a near-vertical dive in southern China on Monday. It is hoped the cockpit voice recorder, recovered intact, will yield clues. It was damaged on the outside but its internal records appeared to be fine, officials said. It has been sent to Beijing for its data to be analysed.  Search teams found the first of the crucial \"black boxes\" in difficult circumstances on Wednesday. Heavy rains have flooded the steep and rugged landscape of the crash site in Wuzhou, making efforts harder for hundreds of rescuers and volunteers, who have so far also found scattered plane debris and the charred remains of personal belongings. On Wednesday, dozens of family members of those on board the flight began to arrive at the scene. Escorted by officials and supporters, many kept their heads bowed as they passed gathered media but some spoke briefly to journalists about their loss. One man told Reuters his nephew had been a passenger on the flight. He and his son had driven five hours from neighbouring Shenzhen province in the hope of being able to find their relative alive. \"I plan to stay until the matter is sorted and I can take his ashes back. But this depends on the work of authorities. \"I hope the country can thoroughly investigate this matter and find out whether it is the manufacturer's fault or a maintenance problem.\" The crash of the passenger plane this week - which had been on a short domestic flight from Kunming to Guangzhou on the coast -  has shocked and devastated China. The country has had a strong air safety record over the past three decades. President Xi Jinping swiftly ordered a full-scale investigation into the tragedy, dispatching Vice Premier Liu He and hundreds of personnel to the rural hillside region in Guangxi province. But none of the knowledge released so far about the flight indicates any technical problems or anything amiss with environmental factors. At a press conference on Wednesday, aviation officials said there hadn't been any weather or other hazards endured by the flight on its route path. China Eastern said the Boeing 737-800 plane, less than seven years old, had also passed all pre-flight checks. There had been three pilots, China Eastern officials disclosed. The captain had 6,709 hours flying experience, and the first and second officers had 31,769 hours and 556 hours respectively. \"From what we know, the performance of the three pilots had been good and their family life relatively harmonious,\" the airline representative said. Air traffic control had also been in regular communication with the pilots on board right until it entered its near nosedive descent from a cruising height. Flight tracking data showed the plane plummeted thousands of metres in minutes. According to FlightRadar24, the plane was cruising at an altitude of 29,100ft (about 9,000m), but two minutes and 15 seconds later it was recorded at 9,075ft. The last sourced information on the flight showed it ended at 14:22 local time, at an altitude of 3,225ft. Investigators are expected to look at several possible causes, including deliberate action, pilot error, or technical issues such as a structural failure or mid-air collision. China's investigators have also invited US aviation experts to join in the investigation - as the Boeing plane was manufactured in the US. The invitation has been welcomed by the Biden administration.  But US officials said they weren't sure if they would send over a team yet due to China's strict Covid quarantine requirements for incoming visitors. In the meantime, China's aviation officials are carrying out a two-week safety audit of all planes while China Eastern and its two subsidiaries have grounded its fleet of Boeing 737-800s as an emergency precaution.",

            "title": "China Eastern: Plane carrying 132 people crashes in Guangxi hills",
            "text": "A Chinese passenger plane with 132 people on board has crashed in a forested hillside in southern China. The China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 was flying from Kunming to Guangzhou when it plunged to earth in Guangxi province and caught fire. The number of casualties and reason for the crash are not yet known. Rescuers have seen no signs of survivors. Chinese airlines generally have a good safety record - the last major accident took place 12 years ago. The crash has caused shock in China, where President Xi Jinping has ordered an immediate investigation to determine the cause. China Eastern Airlines has grounded all its 737-800s. Flight tracking data suggested the plane lost height rapidly from its cruising altitude before plummeting to the ground. More than 600 emergency responders are said to be at the crash site. Firefighters reached the scene first and managed to extinguish a blaze in the hills caused by the crash. Footage taken by local villagers and shared on Chinese social media - and by state broadcasters - showed fire and smoke from the crash, with plane debris on the ground. Air safety and aviation standards in China have improved vastly in recent decades, following a series of accidents in the 1990s, and crashes such as this are now very rare. The country's last major plane accident was in August 2010, when a flight from Harbin crashed in north-east Yichun during foggy weather, killing 42 people. China Eastern has set up a hotline for people seeking information about those on board. It expressed \"its deep condolences for the passengers and crew members who died\".  Earlier, it greyed out its logo on its Weibo account and also changed its website to black and white in an apparent sign of mourning. As a precaution, China Eastern's entire fleet of Boeing 737-800 jets has been grounded. It took just two and a half minutes for an apparently normal flight to turn into a tragedy. The aircraft was a 737-800, a well-proven design first produced in the late 1990s. It is a workhorse of the aviation world, with thousands still in service.  It has a strong safety record. Fatigue cracks have been found in some older planes, but this one was not quite seven years old. There is no connection here with the 737 MAX, a newer version of the 737, which was grounded for more than a year and a half after a design flaw triggered two major accidents. Investigators will be looking at many possible causes - among them deliberate action, such as terrorism, technical issues such as structural failure, or a mid-air collision. They will look at communications from the pilots, examine the state of the wreckage - and search for the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. Those recorders should contain the information needed to confirm exactly what happened during those minutes and why. Staff at Guangzhou airport are directing worried relatives to a separate zone set up to receive them.  One woman waiting for news there told local media she had booked a seat on the flight, but ended up switching to an earlier plane. \"I feel very sad,\" she said. Her sister and four friends were on the crashed plane, AFP news agency reports. State-owned China Eastern is one of China's big three airlines, along with China Southern and Air China. Flight MU5735 left Kunming at 13:11 local time (05:11 GMT) and was scheduled to arrive in Guangzhou at 15:05. Flight tracking sites report the plane was in the air for just over an hour and was nearing its destination when it went down in Wuzhou, a verdant, hilly area prone to mixed weather at this time of year as China enters its annual flood season.  The weather was cloudy, but visibility was reported to have been good at the time of the crash. Footage said to be of Flight MU5735 plummeting vertically from the sky has been circulating on social media. The plane dropped thousands of metres in three minutes, flight tracker data showed. According to FlightRadar24 data, the plane was cruising at 29,100ft, but two minutes and 15 seconds later it was recorded at 9,075ft. The last sourced information on the flight showed it ended at 14:22 local time, at an altitude of 3,225ft.  \"Usually the plane is on autopilot during cruise stage. So it is very hard to fathom what happened,\" Li Xiaojin, a Chinese aviation expert, told Reuters news agency. Another expert, Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge, told China's Global Times newspaper: \"It is very likely that the aircraft lost power at cruising altitude, resulting in the pilot losing control of the aircraft.  \"This is a very serious technical failure in which the plane inevitably enters a high-speed descent.\" The Boeing 737-800 plane was nearly seven years old, according to tracker websites. It is the predecessor model to the Boeing 737 Max line, which were the planes involved in deadly crashes in Indonesia in 2018 and Ethiopia in 2019. China banned that model after those crashes. Boeing issued a statement on the crash of MU5735, saying: \"We are aware of the initial media reports and are working to gather more information.\" China's Civil Aviation Administration said it had dispatched its investigators to the scene.

            "text": "A cargo plane was written off due to \"extensive damage\" after a hard landing at Exeter Airport, a report said. The Boeing 737-4Q8 was returning from East Midlands Airport with a pilot and co-pilot who were not injured. The plane was \"beyond economical repair\", a report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said. West Atlantic, the plane's Swedish-based operator, said only the flight commander will be allowed to land at Exeter Airport until further notice. The AAIB confirmed the plane had been written off as it was deemed beyond repair and would no longer be in use after the land. The aircraft had a hard landing as a result of the plane's approach to the runway continuing after it became \"unstable\", the report said. \"The commander may have given the co-pilot the benefit of doubt and believed she had the ability to correct an approach that became unstable in the final few hundred feet of the approach, it said. The co-pilot said she did not know what caused the hard landing but did not believe there was a technical issue. After the aircraft left the runway it was \"listing to the left\", the report said. \"It was then that the crew realised there was something 'seriously wrong' with the aircraft,\" it added.  It explained the damage may have been lessened if the crew had ended the attempt at landing and tried again for a second time.  The main body of the wings was \"cracked and buckled\" and the top end appeared \"creased and rippled\", it said. The runway was undamaged after the incident on 02:37 GMT on 19 January 2021.

            "title": "Pilots 'raised Boeing safety fears' months before Ethiopia crash",
            "text": "American Airlines pilots confronted Boeing about potential safety issues in its 737 Max planes in a meeting last November, US media are reporting. They urged swift action after the first deadly 737 Max crash off Indonesia in October, according to audio obtained by CBS and the New York Times.  Boeing reportedly resisted their calls but promised a software fix. But this had not been rolled out when an Ethiopian Airlines' 737 Max crashed four months later, killing 157 people. Currently 737 Max planes are grounded worldwide amid concerns that an anti-stall system may have contributed to both crashes.  Boeing is in the process of updating the system, known as MCAS, but denies it was solely to blame for the disasters. In a closed door meeting with Boeing executives last November, which was secretly recorded, American Airlines' pilots can be heard expressing concerns about the safety of MCAS. Boeing vice-president Mike Sinnett told the pilots: \"No one has yet to conclude that the sole cause of this was this function on the airplane.\"  Later in the meeting, he added: \"The worst thing that can ever happen is a tragedy like this, and the even worse thing would be another one.\" The pilots also complained they had not been told about MCAS, which was new to the 737 Max, until after the Lion Air crash off Indonesia, which killed 189.  \"These guys didn't even know the damn system was on the airplane, nor did anybody else,\" said Mike Michaelis, head of safety for the pilots' union. Boeing declined to comment on the November meeting, saying: \"We are focused on working with pilots, airlines and global regulators to certify the updates on the Max and provide additional training and education to safely return the planes to flight.\" American Airlines said it was \"confident that the impending software updates, along with the new training elements Boeing is developing for the Max, will lead to recertification of the aircraft soon.\" Following the Lion Air crash, Boeing issued additional instructions to pilots in case they faced a malfunction of the MCAS. But in a letter obtained by the AFP news agency, Mr Michaelis said the instructions weren't sufficient to help pilots in the event of malfunction. Mr Michaelis also reportedly asked Boeing executives at the meeting to consider a software upgrade for the 737 MAX 8 - which probably would have required the planes be grounded for some time. The executives said they didn't want to rush out a fix, and said they expected pilots to be able to handle problems, according to the New York Times.  Investigators believe in both deadly crashes a faulty sensor triggered the plane's MCAS anti-stall system, which repeatedly pushed the nose of the plane down.  Earlier this month Boeing admitted that it knew about another problem with its 737 Max jets a year before the fatal accidents, but took no action. The firm said it had inadvertently made an alarm feature optional instead of standard, but insisted that this did not jeopardise flight safety. The feature - an Angle of Attack (AOA) Disagree alert - was designed to let pilots know when two different sensors were reporting conflicting data. The US Federal Aviation Administration said the issue was \"low risk\", but said Boeing could have helped to \"eliminate possible confusion\" by letting it know earlier. Boeing has been working on a software fix for its flight system and is hoping for quick approval from regulators.  But it is unclear if the planes will be back in the air before the end of the critical summer travel season.",

            "text": "Bombardier, the train and plane manufacturer at the centre of a trade row between the US, the UK and Canada, has seen a 57% rise in profits. The US Commercial department had threatened to impose 292% tariffs on its C-Series aircraft which employs some 4,000 workers in Belfast. But the US International Trade Commission (ITC) rejected the complaint which had been made by Boeing. Now, Bombardier says it is moving \"into a strong growth cycle\".  Bombardier's earnings before interest and tax for the whole of last year rose from $427m (\u00a3304m) to $672m, driven by rising sales and profits in its rail division. Loses at its commercial aircraft division fell from $417m to $377m and profits at its business aircraft division rose 13%. Bombardier calls itself \"the world's leading manufacturer of both planes and trains\", but this statement is only true because of its dominance of the world of train systems. It remains a minnow besides Airbus and Boeing in terms of plane sales. Its Transportation division is by far the largest of the group's operations, turning over $8.5bn last year. That makes it twice the size by revenue of its Business Aircraft division and almost four times the size of its Commercial Aircraft business, which includes the C-Series planes. Its high-profile contracts include: US planemaker Boeing had originally complained that the C-Series had been sold to US airline Delta at \"absurdly low prices\", made possible by unfair subsidies to Bombardier from the British and Canadian governments. The company is Northern Ireland's biggest employer. Heavy investment in the C-Series had already pushed Bombardier to the brink of bankruptcy in 2015 and the threat of tariffs looked likely to push it over the edge. Following the original complaint, European planemaker Airbus bought a 51% stake in the C-Series project for just $1 and Bombardier agreed to set up a final assembly line in Mobile, Alabama. The ITC ruling, announced in January, was published on Thursday. It said that Bombardier's C- Series jets ordered by Delta did not compete with any of Boeing's planes and the sale did not come at Delta's expense. \"Boeing lost no sales or revenues,\" the ITC said in its 194-page ruling. Bombardier is also in the middle of a five-year turnaround plan. Chief executive Alain Bellemare said:  \"2018 will be a pivotal year for Bombardier. We are moving out of our investment cycle and into a strong growth cycle.\" \"Because of this solid performance, we begin 2018 with great momentum. Our operational transformation is in full motion.\"",

            "text": "The owner of British Airways may bid for Norwegian Air Shuttle, the fast-expanding budget airline. Buying the airline would allow International Airlines Group to increase its market share amid rising competition from low-cost carriers.  Norwegian said it had not been aware that IAG had acquired a 4.6% stake until media reports on Thursday. Shares in Norwegian closed 47% higher after news of the bid interest emerged, while IAG fell 1.2%. Norwegian said it has not held talks with IAG but said the interest \"confirms the sustainability and potential of our business model and global growth\". IAG said it had bought a minority stake in the airline with a view to opening talks about a deal.  \"The minority investment is intended to establish a position from which to initiate discussions with Norwegian, including the possibility of a full offer for Norwegian,\" IAG said.  However, it said no discussions have taken place and it had not decided whether to make an offer.  Norwegian has been ruffling feathers in the aviation market, bringing a budget airline model to the long-haul sector. The industry is divided as to whether it works when you cross the Atlantic.  Norwegian has bet big that it does. Starting life as a short-haul carrier, it has nearly 200 long-range aircraft on order and the legacy carriers have had to respond.  IAG is dabbling with its own offshoot, Level, and BA announced cheaper fares for long-haul passengers not checking in bags and not wanting to choose a seat. Air France's Joon is also trying to cut long-haul costs.  Norwegian is still losing money and its finances are stretched by the number of planes it is buying, but today's announcement from BA suggests Norwegian has proved the concept is sound. Whether passengers are best served by a legacy carrier swallowing a competitive upstart is another debate.  Norwegian Air has earned a name for its low-cost deals, such as \u00a399 one-way flights from Edinburgh and Dublin to New York.   However, it posted a net loss in 2017 and had to raise fresh funds earlier this year to cope with its rapid expansion and higher fuel costs.   Nevertheless, its move into discount intercontinental flights has shaken up the market and forced bigger rivals such as IAG and Air France to take measures to win back customers. IAG has already put a toe in the budget long-haul market with Level from Barcelona, while adding European airport slots from failed UK airline Monarch.  IAG chief executive Willie Walsh has long been interested in low-cost long-haul concept long before it set up Level, said Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo.   \"This may be an attempt to accelerate its development, while also adding to the scale and reach of [IAG-owned] Vueling in the intra-European market.\" This week, BA began selling \"Basic\" tickets from London to destinations including Boston, Delhi, Dubai, Hong Kong and Singapore. Fares start from \u00a3143, but passengers must pay \u00a360 to check a bag and \u00a320 for seat selection. Simon Calder, travel editor of the Independent, told the BBC: \"The main purpose of this initial move is to get more competitive with Norwegian, which is building an extensive network from Gatwick and poaching passengers from British Airways. Most of the first 10 destinations are on the Norwegian network.\"",

            "title": "Boeing uncertain how 737 crashes will hit profits",
            "text": "Boeing has said it still does not know how the crisis over the safety of its 737 Max 8 jets will affect its profits. In its latest set of results, Boeing said that uncertainty over when the plane would be allowed to fly again meant it could not forecast profits for this year. A fall in 737 deliveries has already led to a $1bn drop in revenues. In March, a Max 8 belonging to Ethiopian Airlines crashed, killing all 157 passengers and crew. It was the second crash involving a Max 8 jet in five months. The two disasters prompted aviation regulators round the world to ground the aircraft. \"Due to the uncertainty of the timing and conditions surrounding return to service of the 737 Max fleet, new guidance [on profits] will be issued at a future date,\" Boeing said in its first quarter results. Boeing is temporarily cutting production of the 737 airliner from 52 planes a month to 42 from this month.  Despite the drop in production Boeing has not laid off staff and is maintaining order levels with many suppliers, all of which is keeping costs high. Meanwhile, some 50 deliveries of new 737 Max planes have been withdrawn. The worldwide fleet of 737 Max planes totalled 387 aircraft at the time of the grounding. Boeing is developing new software for the jet's Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), an anti-stall system which has come under scrutiny since the crashes.  It said last week it was making \"steady progress\" on the path to certifying a software update which had been put through 135 test and production flights.   Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said: \"We have great confidence in the update of the software and with the test flights that have occurred. I have personally been on two of those flights and I have seen the confidence that the team has in the system.\"  Boeing said on Wednesday it expects a certification flight with the US Federal Aviation Administration in the \"near term\".  Boeing's commercial aircraft division managed to offset the impact of the Max 8 groundings by increasing production of its 787 planes from 12 a month to 14. Even so, the division still saw a 9% fall in revenue to $11.8bn from $12.9bn.

            "title": "Iran plane downing: Second day of protests turns up heat on leaders",
            "text": "Iran's leaders have faced a second day of protests following their admission the military shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane, killing all 176 people on board, many of them Iranians. Protesters in Tehran and in several other cities chanted slogans against the leadership. Clashes with security forces and the firing of tear gas are reported. Iran admitted \"unintentionally\" hitting the plane after initially denying it, amid rising tensions with the US. The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was shot down near Tehran last Wednesday, shortly after Iran had launched missiles at two airbases housing US forces in Iraq. Those strikes were a response to the US killing of senior Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad on 3 January. Dozens of Iranians and Canadians, as well as nationals from Ukraine, the UK, Afghanistan and Sweden died on the plane. Demonstrators attended new protests despite a large deployment of security forces. Riot police, members of the elite Revolutionary Guard on motorbikes, and plainclothes security officials were out in force. In one apparently symbolic act rejecting state propaganda, video showed students taking care not to walk over US and Israeli flags painted on the ground at Shahid Beheshti university in Tehran. In some social media clips, protesters can be heard chanting anti-government slogans, including: \"They are lying that our enemy is America, our enemy is right here.\" Many of the protesters are women. Social media footage showed clapping and chanting protesters in Tehran's Azadi Square. BBC Persian says there has been a crackdown there by security forces, with tear gas fired. The semi-official Fars news agency said up to 1,000 people were protesting at various points in the capital. Protests were also reported in other cities. Those who decide to continue demonstrating will be mindful of the violence with which the security forces have dealt with protest movements in the past, the BBC's Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says. On Saturday, students had gathered outside two universities. They initially did so to pay respect to the victims, but angry protests erupted later in the evening and tear gas was reportedly fired to disperse them. A number of Iranian newspapers have covered the vigils for the plane victims alongside headlines such as \"Shame\" and \"Unforgivable\". But there has also been praise for what one pro-government newspaper called Iran's \"honest\" admission of error. There were also protests on Sunday in Tehran in support of Soleimani, and opposing the US and UK. US President Donald Trump on Sunday repeated warnings that Iran should not target anti-government protesters, saying, \"the World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching\". Britain, meanwhile, has condemned the arrest of the UK ambassador to Iran in Tehran as a \"flagrant violation of international law\". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Rob Macaire was detained after attending a vigil where he was paying respects to victims of the crash, some of whom were British. Mr Macaire said he left the vigil when some people started chanting and had played no part in the demonstration. Iran on Sunday summoned the ambassador to complain about \"his unconventional behaviour of attending an illegal rally\", the foreign ministry website said. Iranian protesters set a UK flag alight in front of the UK embassy on Sunday. In other developments on Sunday: BBC's Jessica Murphy, Edmonton, Alberta Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand gazed out from the photograph projected on the screen with wide smiles, looking like they had been caught laughing at a shared joke.  The \"sweet couple\" likely were.  Along with their two daughters, Daria, 14, and Dorina, 9, they were remembered for their quickness to laughter, their generosity, their full embrace of life. The family of four were among the 13 victims of flight PS752 who came from the Canadian city of Edmonton.   A crowd of some 2,300 people packed into a university gym on Sunday to pay respects to those lost - family, close friends colleagues, classmates -  whose death has left a hole in so many lives.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the crowd that in their sorrow \"your entire country stands with you\".  A friend of Pedram's, through a letter read by his former student Hossein Saghlatoon, said the loss was \"too much to bear\". He was looking forward to many more memorable moments with Pedram and his family, he wrote \"but alas, the cruel hand of destiny had some other plans\".  For three days, Iran denied reports its missiles had brought down the plane, with one spokesman accusing Western nations of \"lying and engaging in psychological warfare\". But on Saturday morning, a statement read on state TV accepted the plane had been shot down. Brig-Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the Revolutionary Guards' aerospace commander, said a missile operator had acted independently and alone, mistaking the plane for a \"cruise missile\". He also said he had informed the authorities about what had happened on Wednesday, raising questions about why Iran had denied involvement for so long. Both Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky and Justin Trudeau have demanded accountability from Iran. Mr Trudeau said on Saturday there must be a full investigation with \"full clarity on how such a horrific tragedy could have occurred\".",

            "title": "Boeing expects 737 Max software fix by end of March",
            "text": "Boeing has told airlines it expects to have new software for its 737 Max plane ready by the end of the month. The plane has been grounded following the Ethiopian Airlines aircraft crash earlier this month.   Documents seen by the BBC confirm that the software update will limit the operation of the controversial MCAS system.  That was the same system used by a Lion Air 737 Max which crashed off the coast of Indonesia last year. Investigators say there are \"clear similarities\" between the two.  Boeing's Dennis Muilenburg, who is the chairman, president and chief executive of the company, said in an open letter: \"Soon we'll release a software update and related pilot training for the 737 Max that will address concerns discovered in the aftermath of the Lion Air Flight 610 accident.\" He said the company had been working in \"full co-operation\" with the relevant authorities and regulators.  There will also be changes to the cockpit warning systems, the flight crew operating manual will be updated and there will be computer-based training for pilots. It is not clear how long the 737 Max will remain grounded.  Investigators looking into the Ethiopian Airlines received data from the aircraft's flight recorders, downloaded by experts in France, earlier this week. They intend to  to issue a preliminary report by mid-April. On Tuesday, investigators examining black box recordings from the flight said they had found \"clear similarities\" with the previous crash. The French BEA accident authority did not detail the similarities, but media reports suggested they found similar flight angles before the crashes. It comes amid continuing questions over 737 Max's design and vetting to fly. Both the Ethiopian Airlines flight eight days ago and the Lion Air aircraft in October crashed within minutes of take-off.  In the case of the Lion Air flight, pilots had difficulties with a new system on the Boeing 737 Max which is designed to keep the plane from stalling. It prevents a jet from pointing upwards at too high an angle, where it could lose its lift. But an investigation of the Lion Air flight showed the automatic anti-stalling system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down more than 20 times. US regulators and safety experts are now asking how thoroughly the FAA and Boeing vetted the anti-stall system and how well pilots around the world were trained for it when their airlines bought new planes. Over the weekend, a report in the Seattle Times claimed that some analysis before the crash found that the system, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, revealed crucial flaws. It claims that managers at the FAA instructed its safety engineers to delegate safety assessments to Boeing and to approve the resulting analysis. The report alleges that the analysis produced by Boeing understated the power of the control system and that it could reset itself every time the pilot responded. This meant that the system could repeatedly push the nose of the plane down. Boeing's Mr Muilenburg said the company was in close touch with the authorities: \"We've been working in full cooperation with the US Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Transportation and the National Transportation Safety Board on all issues relating to both the Lion Air and the Ethiopian Airlines accidents since the Lion Air accident occurred in October last year.\" Meanwhile, Air Canada has announced that it is updating its schedule until at least 1 July to give its customers \"some certainty when booking and travelling\". The airline had been expecting delivery of six new planes in March and April, but has been substituting different aircraft on the 737 Max routes.",

            "text": "Boeing is not a trustworthy company anymore, according to Zipporah Kuria, whose father was killed when a 737 Max plane crashed earlier this year.  Ms Kuria, who met with Europe's aviation watchdog on Wednesday, said: \"I wouldn't even use the word trust anywhere near Boeing.\" Boeing is fighting for its reputation while the 737 Max remains grounded. A company spokesman said: \"The safety of passengers and crews flying on our aircraft is our absolute priority.\"  He said: \"We are truly sorry and we continue to offer our deepest sympathies to the families and friends who lost loved ones in the accidents of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. \"We know we have a deep responsibility to everyone who flies on our airplanes to ensure that the 737 Max is one of the safest aircraft ever to fly.\" Ms Kuria met with European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) along with other family members who lost loved ones, to gain reassurances that the Boeing 737 Max will not return to the skies until rigorous tests are carried out. The British woman's father, Joseph Waithaka, died with 156 others on board an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March.  It was the second crash involving a Boeing 737 Max following the Lion Air disaster in Indonesia which killed all 189 people onboard.  \"They are not trustworthy anymore - if they had been in the past,\" Ms Kuria said.  She said the EASA's executive director Patrick Ky had reassured her that \"he would not be caving\" to either the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US regulator, or Boeing in terms of reclassifying whether the 737 Max is safe for European air travel. Boeing is hoping that the FAA will allow the Max back into the air in the early part of next year but the FAA's close relationship with Boeing has been under intense scrutiny.  It recently emerged that  the FAA allowed the 737 Max to keep flying after the first disaster in October last year despite knowing there was a risk of further crashes.  Ms Kuria said: \"I think the more discovery is done, the more reason we are finding not to trust [Boeing] when it comes to the 737 Max. \"There are so many things that were hidden that shouldn't have been, so many things that were bypassed that shouldn't have been and I think every time we sit down and have a hearing or hear from an aviation authority on documents of discovery we just find out how preventable the death of our loved ones was.\"  Mr Ky said that the European regulator will \"take their time to recertify\" the plane.  Ms Kuria also said her safety concerns not only relate to the plane's automated flight control system which malfunctioned before both crashes but other critical safety systems on board the 737 Max.  During the meeting, EASA said \"they would reassess all the critical safety systems that are on the 737 Max\", according to Ms Kuria. ",

Services between Birmingham and Palma de Mallorca and Barcelona will be cancelled from 3 September. The flights between the airport and Malaga, Alicante, Las Palma, Reykjavik and Tenerife will stop from 29 October. Primera Air said it had taken the decision due to the fact the routes \"didn't perform as well as expected\". It said it was \"deeply sorry\" for the inconvenience this may cause.   In a statement, Birmingham Airport said the news was \"disappointing, especially as there is so much demand for these destinations\". The airline said its priority was ensuring affected passengers were compensated in compliance with EU regulations and alternative travel arrangements had been offered, as well as the option of a full refund if appropriate.  The airline also said the number of flights from Stansted Airport to Malaga had been decreased to five flights a week and services from the airport to Alicante would be cancelled from 1 October.   Its decision did not affect Primera Air's long-haul routes from Stansted, it added. It said overall its operations at the London airport were \"showing very good results\". In June it was revealed the operator was suspending flights from Birmingham to New York and Toronto until next year. Primera Air said since the suspension was announced it had seen reduced demand for its Birmingham winter schedule. \"With this in mind, we will need to carefully consider what is right for the business in 2019 regarding long haul services from Birmingham and will take a decision early next year,\" it added.",

            "title": "US airlines warn of impending 5G flight disruption",
            "text": "The 10 biggest US airlines have warned that the impending switch-on of 5G mobile phone services will cause \"major disruption\" to flights. They said the start of Verizon and AT&T 5G mobile phone services, planned for Wednesday, would cause a \"completely avoidable economic calamity\". Airlines fear C-band 5G signals will disrupt planes' navigation systems, particularly those used in bad weather. The warning was issued in a letter sent to US aviation authorities. The chief executives of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines were joined by others in saying: \"Immediate intervention is needed to avoid significant operational disruption to air passengers, shippers, supply chain and delivery of needed medical supplies\", including vaccine distribution. The BBC has seen the letter outlining their urgent concerns. It was sent to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, as well as the head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the chair of the Federal Communications Commission and the director of the National Economic Council. The BBC understands that negotiations are continuing at the highest levels of the US government about what has been described as a \"very fluid situation\". The airlines want 5G signals to be excluded from \"the approximate two miles of airport runways at affected airports as defined by the FAA on 19 January 2022\".  \"This will allow 5G to be deployed while avoiding harmful impacts on the aviation industry, travelling public, supply chain, vaccine distribution, our workforce and broader economy. \"We further ask that the FAA immediately identify those base stations closest to key airport runways that need to be addressed to ensure safety and avoid disruption,\" they added. These concerns were recently highlighted by the two big planemakers, Airbus and Boeing, in a rare joint warning. The group of airlines said: \"Airplane manufacturers have informed us that there are huge swathes of the operating fleet that may need to be indefinitely grounded.  \"In addition to the chaos caused domestically, this lack of usable wide-body aircraft could potentially strand tens of thousands of Americans overseas.\" In an update on Sunday, the FAA, which oversees aviation safety across the US, said it had cleared \"an estimated 45% of the US commercial fleet to perform low-visibility landings at many of the airports where 5G C-band will be deployed\". The FAA added that it had approved \"two radio altimeter models that are installed in a wide variety of Boeing and Airbus planes\". \"Even with these new approvals, flights at some airports may still be affected,\" the regulator said. \"The FAA also continues to work with manufacturers to understand how radar altimeter data is used in other flight control systems. Passengers should check with their airlines if weather is forecast at a destination where 5G interference is possible.\" Phone companies have spent tens of billions of dollars on upgrading their networks to deploy the 5G technology, which brings much faster internet services and greater connectivity. There have been several delays already because of the aviation concerns, with launch dates in December and earlier this month both being pushed back. US wireless industry group CTIA has previously said 5G is safe and accused the aviation industry of fearmongering and distorting facts. \"A delay will cause real harm. Pushing back deployment one year would subtract $50bn in economic growth, just as our nation recovers and rebuilds from the pandemic,\" said CTIA chief executive Meredith Attwell Baker in a blog post in November.",

            "text": "A deal which sees Airbus take a majority stake in Bombardier's C-Series plane achieves a number of objectives.  First, it means they can be assembled inside the US - potentially avoiding the crippling 300% tariff the US government wants to see imposed on each plane.  Second, it gives the aircraft the benefit of the global sales and muscle, plus the all-round credibility, of Airbus - particularly in the Asian market where interest in a plane well suited to that market has been low so far. Finally, it safeguards jobs in Canada and the UK for now - winning valuable points for politicians in Ottawa, Belfast and Westminster.  If it looks like a good deal for Bombardier, it looks like a great deal for Airbus.  Without spending a penny in cash, it has acquired a majority share in a plane that everyone thinks is impressive and one that the Canadian taxpayer paid to develop.  It's a bit like Manchester United taking a majority share in Accrington Stanley for nothing, knowing they had one brilliant player who wasn't being seen on prime time telly.  The financial weakness of Bombardier had been a significant turn-off to potential buyers. The last thing you want to do as an airline is to place a big order with a supplier with doubts hanging over its long-term financial viability. This deal assuages those fears.  It also seems to prove the old saying - my enemy's enemy is my friend. After years of bitter and costly disputes with Boeing, Airbus may have thought that anyone they wanted to crush must be worth supporting. But that analysis is too crude. For all its seeming elegance, this deal was not inevitable. China tried to muscle in on this party and held discussions over the past year about taking either a stake in the Canadian company or a stake in just its jet business - as Airbus has done. That would have brought together a state-owned manufacturer with deep pockets and a rapidly growing domestic aviation market coupled with some top drawer technology to use as a blueprint for the future.  You would have thought that was the worst possible outcome for Boeing and they would have done anything to prevent that. However, I'm told that Boeing was offered this same deal (and UK government sources hinted at this very recently) and turned it down.  The Canadian government was thought to oppose a deal which resulted in a Chinese majority share in the C-Series, which may have convinced Boeing it could afford to walk away.   However, the fact that Boeing passed on it and the speed with which this deal was wrapped up with Airbus suggests two things. Boeing is pretty confident in its own product range and Airbus realised what a great deal it was for them.",

            "text": "The Boeing 747, the US plane that revolutionised air travel, has been given a regal send-off in the skies over Washington State. Atlas Air, an American cargo airline, took delivery of the last 747 to be manufactured on Thursday morning. The crew flew a special flight path, drawing a huge crown in the sky with the numbers seven, four and seven. It comes days after workers said their final goodbye to the iconic plane, dubbed the Queen of the Skies.  The 747 is one of the world's most recognisable planes, having been in production for more than 50 years, and is credited with starting the era of the jumbo jet, being the first aircraft to earn the nickname. On Tuesday, thousands of employees from Boeing gathered at the company's factory in Everett, Washington - the home of the 747 since 1967 -  to say farewell.  Among those in attendance was actor John Travolta, an aviation enthusiast and private pilot.  As an ambassador for Qantas airlines, he remembered learning to fly the 747-400. \"[It was] the toughest programme that any commercial pilot will ever have to endure,\"  he said. Elsewhere in the crowd were also some of those who helped develop the jet in the 1960s - the so-called \"incredibles\". The last 747 rolled off the assembly line 7 December, completing inspections, flight tests and getting a paint job before finally being handed over to Atlas, which operates the aircraft as freighters. Designed in just 28 months, the 747 was the first ever twin-aisle jetliner and was first introduced by the now-defunct airline Pan Am in 1970. Traditionally one of Boeing's best selling products, the 747 has suffered declining demand in recent years, as both the company and its European rival Airbus developed more fuel-efficient and profitable planes.   In 2020, Boeing announced that it would end production. Its largest new jet, the delayed 777X, is not expected to hit the market until 2025.",

            "text": "The boss of the world's second biggest airline has said that tackling climate change will make flying more expensive. \"Over time, it's going to cost us all more, but it's the right approach that we must take,\" Delta Air Lines chief executive Ed Bastian told the BBC. Aviation is responsible for about 2.5% of the carbon emissions that are warming the planet, according to the International Energy Agency. Critics argue the best way to reduce them is by flying less. Atlanta-based Delta says that after spending $30m (\u00a322.4m) a year on carbon-offsetting it has been carbon neutral since March 2020. It has also pledged to spend $1bn over the next decade to cancel out all the emissions it creates. More fuel-efficient planes, sustainable aviation fuels and removing carbon from the atmosphere are some of the ways it hopes to achieve this. Reducing carbon emissions is crucial if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels as agreed in Paris in 2015, and has been the focus of the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow. Andreas Schafer, professor of energy and transport at University College London, says it will \"cost trillions rather than billions of dollars\" to move the global aviation sector to net zero carbon emissions. Preliminary results from his team's research suggest airfares would need to increase by 10%-20% to cover the costs.  \"In the short-term, government support will be needed with those costs as decarbonising aviation will be extremely challenging, and current efforts will need to be scaled up dramatically\", says Prof Schafer. Mr Bastian concedes it is an ambitious goal that his airline won't be able to achieve alone. \"It's the biggest long-term challenge this industry faces,\" he said. \"We're in an industry that's classified as hard to decarbonise because we don't have the bio-fuels or the sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) en masse yet that we're going to need.\"  Delta aims to be using 10% sustainable aviation fuel by the end of 2030.  Many airlines and fuel companies are investing in SAFs. Other technologies being developed involve turning food waste into jet fuel and using carbon dioxide pulled out of the air. However, these still cost more than traditional jet fuels and the quantities needed are also seen as problematic.  According to the US government, global demand for jet fuel is set to more than double by 2050 .  The number of passenger flights is set to jump from a pre-pandemic 4.5 billion to 10 billion by 2050, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).  IATA director general Willie Walsh told the BBC that while creating the levels of SAF production needed was a big challenge, \"it is perfectly possible if industry and governments work together\".  \"Production increases will bring the cost down to competitive levels. We've seen similar increases in the development of solar and wind power in recent decades.\" At the UN climate change summit in Glasgow, 23 countries have pledged to work together to get the aviation industry to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.  More efficient energy use, sustainable aviation fuels and electric aeroplanes are all part of their ambitions.  However, environmental campaign group Greenpeace says the agreement is \"brazen greenwashing\".  \"This announcement is full of scams like offsetting, and excessive optimism on so-called 'sustainable aviation fuels' and future aircraft designs,\" says Greenpeace's Klara Maria Schenk. \"But it lacks the one thing that's needed to deliver the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C which is tangible action to prioritise green travel and reduce flights.\" Whilst many businesses and individuals have used the pandemic as a chance to re-evaluate their carbon footprints, Mr Bastian thinks the number of flights will return to pre-pandemic levels. \"All forms of travel are on the way back. Families are the part of the travelling public that we're most happy to see, because there's been some really difficult stories over time of families not being able to connect for long [periods]\".  Business travel is also returning because video meetings can't replace everything, says Mr Bastian. \"There's a real unity and sense of purpose that we have when people get back together in person\". That desire to travel helped Delta to report a $194m profit in the three months to the end of September, its first profit since the pandemic began. Before the pandemic Delta was the world's second biggest airline, flying 200 million passengers in 2019. As of September it was operating at 71% of its pre-pandemic capacity. The recovery in its domestic US market has been fastest, with long-haul routes to Asia the slowest. That echoes the pattern seen in a recent forecast from planemaker Boeing, which forecast a full recovery of global aviation would take until 2024. Like other airlines, Delta has received billions in government support to get through the pandemic, but is hopeful of a brighter future now the US has reopened its borders to international travellers.  Mr Bastian says this may take some adjusting to and there may be long queues at airports as Covid vaccines and paperwork are checked. However, he is confident in the airline's outlook and says the pandemic was \"an opportunity to invest in our future\". Now the airline is making money again he says: \"We hope to be able to maintain that and go into the new year as a profitable carrier.\" You can watch Ed Bastian's full interview on \"Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst\" this weekend on BBC World News at Saturday 23:30 GMT, Sunday 05:30 and 16:30 GMT and Monday at 08:30 GMT",

            "title": "Ethiopian Airlines crash: Boeing reduces 737 production",
            "text": "Boeing is temporarily cutting production of its best-selling 737 airliner in the continuing fall-out from crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia.  Production will drop from 52 planes a month to 42 from mid-April, Boeing has said in a statement.  The decision is a response to a halt in deliveries of the 737 Max - the model involved in the two accidents.  The plane is currently grounded as preliminary findings suggest its anti-stall system was at fault.  An Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crashed only minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa in March, killing all 157 people on board.   The same type flown by the Indonesian airline Lion Air crashed into the sea only five months earlier, shortly after taking off from Jakarta. That accident claimed the lives of 189 people.  In both cases, preliminary findings showed the pilots had wrestled with the anti-stall system, known as MCAS, which caused the planes to nose-dive repeatedly.  A report from the Ethiopian authorities issued on Thursday said the pilots of flight ET302 \"repeatedly\" followed procedures recommended by Boeing before the crash.  \"We now know that the recent Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents were caused by a chain of events, with a common chain link being erroneous activation of the aircraft's MCAS function. We have the responsibility to eliminate this risk, and we know how to do it,\" the statement from Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said.  He repeated that Boeing was making progress on updating the MCAS software and finalising new training for Max pilots.  \"As we continue to work through these steps, we're adjusting the 737 production system temporarily to accommodate the pause in Max deliveries, allowing us to prioritise additional resources to focus on software certification and returning the Max to flight,\" he said.  Current employment levels would be maintained, the statement said, and a new committee is being set up to look at \"policies and processes for the design and development of the airplanes we build\".  The 10 March crash of Ethiopian Airlines ET302 led to airlines round the world grounding their 737 Max aircraft.  The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was one of the last major regulators to order the grounding of the Max, leading some to accuse it of being too close to Boeing.  Questions are being asked about why the planes were not grounded earlier.  Deliveries of the Max were halted, leading to an excess of the planes needing storage.  After the statement, Boeing shares fell just over 1% in after-hours trading to $387.14 (\u00a3333).   Boeing apologised on Thursday saying it was \"sorry for the lives lost\" in both accidents. But this has failed to satisfy many relatives who questioned why Boeing did not act earlier to take the planes out of service.  The chief pilot's father, Dr Getachew Tessema, told the BBC the apology was \"too little, too late\". Yared Getachew, 29, had more than 8,000 hours of flying experience when he was killed.  \"I am very proud about my son and the other pilot, both of them,\" he told the BBC's Emmanuel Igunza.  \"To the last minute they struggled as much as they could but unfortunately they were not able to stop it.  \"I don't regret that he was a pilot. He died in the course of his duty.\" Dr Tessema levels the blame squarely at Boeing, questioning why the company did not stop the 737 Max flying after the Indonesia crash.  \"Why did they let them fly? Because they were in competition. They want to sell more. Human life has no meaning in some societies.\" Relatives of an American passenger who died in the Ethiopian crash, 24-year-old Samya Stumo, filed the first lawsuit against Boeing on Thursday in Chicago.

            "title": "Boeing 737 Max Lion Air crash caused by series of failures",
            "text": "A series of failures led to the crash of a Lion Air flight, which killed 189 people and led to the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max, a report has found. Investigators said faults by Boeing, Lion Air and pilots caused the crash. Five months after the disaster in October last year, an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed, killing all 157 people on board, which led to the grounding of the entire 737 Max fleet. Faults with the plane's design have been linked to both crashes. On Friday, air crash investigators in Indonesia released their final report, detailing the list of events that caused the Lion Air jet to plunge into the Java Sea. \"From what we know, there are nine things that contributed to this accident,\" Indonesian air accident investigator Nurcahyo Utomo told reporters at a news conference.  \"If one of the nine hadn't occurred, maybe the accident wouldn't have occurred.\" The 353-page report found the jet should have been grounded before departing on the fatal flight because of an earlier cockpit issue. However, because the issue was not recorded properly the plane was allowed to take off without the fault being fixed, it said. Further, a crucial sensor - which had been bought from a repair shop in Florida - had not been properly tested, the report found. On Friday, the US aviation regulator revoked the company's certification. The sensor fed information to the plane's Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System - or MCAS. That software, which is designed to help prevent the 737 Max from stalling, has been a focus for investigators trying to find the cause of both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes. Indonesian investigators identified issues with the system, which repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down, leaving pilots fighting for control. It showed there were incorrect assumptions about how the MCAS control system would behave and that the \"deficiencies\" had been highlighted during training. Further, the report found that the first officer, who had performed poorly in training, struggled to run through a list of procedures that he should have had memorised. He was flying the plane just before it entered into the fatal dive, but the report said the captain had not briefed him properly when he handed over the controls as they struggled to keep the plane in the air. The report also found that 31 pages were missing from the plane's maintenance log. Indonesian investigators have previously said mechanical and design problems were key factors in the crash of the Lion Air plane. This report describes a catalogue of failures - from poor communication to bad design to inadequate flying skills - which culminated in the deaths of 189 people. There are lots of what-ifs here. If the crew of the previous days flight had given a more detailed description of the problems they'd faced, the aircraft might never have taken off on its fatal flight. And if the captain, who'd successfully kept the plane in the air - despite the intervention of a rogue automated system he didn't understand - hadn't handed over to his less-capable first officer, disaster might still have been avoided. As Boeing's chief executive Dennis Muilenburg has repeatedly stated, there was a chain of events. But at the heart of that chain was MCAS - a control system that the pilots didn't know about, and which was vulnerable to a single sensor failure.  Boeing  - and regulators - allowed the system to be designed in this way and didn't change it after the Lion Air crash, leading to a further disaster. And that means that while the report clearly points to serious failures by a parts supplier and by the airline itself, it is Boeing that will bear the greatest share of responsibility. Indonesian authorities laid out some recommendations for Boeing in the report, including that it redesign MCAS and provide adequate information about it in pilot manuals and training.  In a statement, Boeing said it was \"addressing\" the recommendations from Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee. The planemaker said it was \"taking actions to enhance the safety of the 737 Max to prevent the flight control conditions that occurred in this accident from ever happening again\".  On Tuesday, the firm ousted Kevin McAllister, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, making him the most senior official to leave the company since the two crashes. Boeing also said it expected the 737 Max to be re-certified for flying by the end of the year. The company said \"we look forward to continuing to work together\" with Lion Air in the future. A Lion Air spokesman said the crash was an \"unthinkable tragedy\" and it was essential to take immediate corrective actions to ensure a similar accident never occurred again. The pressure on Boeing to explain what it knew about the problems with the 737 Max has intensified. There were revelations this month that employees had exchanged messages about issues with MCAS while the plane was being certified in 2016.  In documents provided by Boeing to lawmakers, a pilot wrote that he had run into unexpected trouble during tests. He said he had \"basically lied to the regulators [unknowingly]\". Boeing said this week it had developed a training update and that it expected regulators to allow the planes to return to the skies before the beginning of 2020. The grounding of the 737 Max has taken a toll on the planemaker. Profits more than halved to $895m (\u00a3687m) in the third quarter and the firm said it would cut production of its 787 Dreamliner, blaming trade uncertainties. Boeing boss Dennis Muilenburg was also stripped of his title as chairman by the board earlier this month, but remains as chief executive.",

            "text": "Troubled travel firm Thomas Cook has been reassuring customers who contacted the firm with concerns about holiday trips, after its share price crashed. Its share price fell sharply at the end of last week, and it dropped a further 14% on Monday to just 10p. Thomas Cook has been reassuring people on social media, and in a statement at the weekend, telling customers that it is \"business as usual\". The firm also said it was looking to strengthen its financial position. On Sunday, Thomas Cook said: \"We have the support of our lending banks and major shareholders, and just this week we agreed additional funding for our coming winter cash low period.  \"We have ample resources to operate our business and at the same time, as usual, our liquidity position continues to strengthen into the summer period.\" Thomas Cook also said: \"We're responsible for taking over 20 million people abroad on holiday every year and we take that responsibility very seriously.  As an ATOL-protected business, our customers can have complete confidence in booking their holiday with us.\" By Kevin Peachey, BBC personal finance reporter Protection under the ATOL - or Air Travel Organiser's Licence - scheme means UK travellers on an air package holiday do not lose their money or become stranded abroad if a holiday firm collapses. It also covers many charter flights and means that, if the operator collapses while people are away, they can finish their holiday and be flown home at no extra cost. If the business collapses before they go away, the scheme will provide a replacement holiday of equal value, or a refund. When flights are booked on their own, or when people book flights and accommodation separately, the ATOL scheme does not usually come into effect. However, the ATOL scheme does now cover more custom-built holidays than it used to. If a holiday is ATOL-protected it will be clearly marked with a certificate on holiday documents. The scheme is run by the UK Civil Aviation Authority and is backed by the UK government.  Thomas Cook released its statement after concerned customers asked the firm on social media if it was \"about to go under\" or \"going into administration\". Others had queried if the firm was \"in danger of collapsing\",  and if their holiday flights and packages were safe. But on Twitter, Thomas Cook said: \"We have been taking customers on their holidays with us for 175 years and we plan to do so for a very long time.\" It also said: \"We are very much trading as normal and we aren't going into administration\". On Friday, analysts at Citigroup said the travel firm's shares were \"worthless\".  The bank's damning conclusion came a day after Thomas Cook issued its third profit warning in less than a year and reported a \u00a31.5bn half-year loss. Citigroup analysts also pointed to a warning from auditor EY in Thomas' Cook's results which warned of \"material uncertainties\" over the group's sale of its airline, on which a new \u00a3300m bank facility depends. Thomas Cook is in the process of seeking bidders for its fleet of 105 jets as it tries to raise funds for the business. It says it has received \"multiple bids\" for the fleet. The company is also seeking to cut costs. It has closed 21 of its High Street stores, its currency arm Thomas Cook Money is under review and more \"cost efficiencies\" are planned. It has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays due to Brexit. But it has also suffered from competition from online travel agents and low-cost airlines.",

            "text": "Flight data indicates a China Eastern Airlines plane that crashed in March was intentionally put into a nose-dive, according to US media reports. Investigators have so far not found any mechanical or technical faults with the jet, the reports say, citing a preliminary assessment by US officials. The Boeing 737-800 was flying between the southern Chinese cities of Kunming and Guangzhou when it crashed. All 132 passengers and crew on board the plane died in the crash. \"The plane did what it was told to do by someone in the cockpit,\" according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the story, citing a person familiar with US officials' preliminary assessment of the cause of the crash. Data from one of the plane's \"black box\" flight recorders, which was recovered from the crash site, suggested that inputs to the controls pushed the plane into a near-vertical dive, the report said. ABC News, citing US officials, also reported that the crash was believed to have been caused by an intentional act. Investigators looking into the crash are examining whether it was due to intentional action on the flight deck, with no evidence found of a technical malfunction, according to Reuters, which cited two people briefed on the matter. China Eastern Airlines previously said the three pilots on board were qualified and in good health.  The airline separately told the Wall Street Journal that there was no indication that any of the pilots was in financial trouble. China Eastern Airlines did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), which is leading investigations into the crash, also did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.  Last month, the CAAC said reports that the plane may have been crashed deliberately had \"gravely misled the public\" and \"interfered with accident investigation work\". Investigators are still in the process of analysing flight data and the wreckage from the crash, Chinese state media outlet the Global Times reported on Wednesday. It also said the CAAC will continue to \"carry out the accident investigation in a scientific, rigorous and orderly manner\".  The Chinese embassy in Washington, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and plane maker Boeing declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal's report, due to guidelines set out by the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization. \"Under the rules regarding crash investigations... only the investigating agency can comment on an open air accident investigation,\" a Boeing spokesperson told the BBC on Wednesday. The company previously said it was assisting investigations in China and communicating with the NTSB. Chinese airlines generally have a good safety record - the last major accident took place 12 years ago. The China Eastern Airlines plane that crashed was less than seven years old.",

            "title": "Boeing 777: Dozens grounded after Denver engine failure",
            "text": "US plane manufacturer Boeing has recommended grounding all of the 777-model aircraft which have the same type of engine that suffered failure and shed debris over Denver on Saturday. It said 128 jets should be suspended until inspections are carried out. United Airlines and Japan's two main operators have already stopped using 56 planes with the same engine. Flight 328, carrying 231 passengers, was forced to make an emergency landing at Denver airport. No-one was injured. \"While [an] investigation is ongoing, we recommended suspending operations of the 69 in-service and 59 in-storage 777 aircraft powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000-112 engines,\" the company said in a statement. Pratt & Whitney said it had dispatched a team to work with investigators.  According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), United is the only US airline flying this model of 777, with the others being in Japan and South Korea.  Korean Air, which has six planes in operation and 10 in storage, said it was awaiting instruction from South Korean regulators regarding any measures for its 777 jets. United Flight 328, bound for Honolulu, suffered a failure in its right-hand engine. Debris from the jet was found scattered over a nearby residential area after it returned to Denver airport. The agency has ordered extra inspections of Boeing 777 jets fitted with the Pratt & Whitney 4000 engine following the incident. \"We reviewed all available safety data following [Saturday's] incident,\" said FAA administrator Steve Dickson in a statement.  \"Based on the initial information, we concluded that the inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine, used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes.\" The FAA met representatives from the engine firm and Boeing on Sunday evening. The initial finding of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is that most of the damage occurred in the right engine, where two fan blades were fractured and other blades also impacted. The main body of the aeroplane suffered only minor damage.  The engine failure is the another blow for Boeing after its 737 Max aircraft was grounded for 18 months following two aviation accidents that left 346 people dead. Aircraft engine failures are rare. Uncontained failures, where debris can erupt from the engine in any direction are mercifully very rare indeed. But an uncontained failure is also much more dangerous. A modern twin-engine airliner is designed to be able to fly safely for hours using a single engine. The shrapnel from an uncontained failure, however, can cause serious damage to the rest of the plane, and if it passes through the cabin, it can be lethal. Experts say the failure in the Denver incident appears to have been uncontained, but the damage to the aircraft itself was thankfully minor. Also worrying is that the incident itself appears to have a number of similarities with another failure that occurred on a United Airlines flight in 2018. If the cause in this case is found to be the same - and remember, it may not be - that would raise questions about why the response to that incident from the manufacturer and regulators was unable to prevent a repeat. Passengers on board the Denver flight described a \"large explosion\"  shortly after take-off. \"The plane started shaking violently, and we lost altitude and we started going down,\" David Delucia said. He added that he and his wife placed their wallets in their pockets so that \"in case we did go down, we could be ID'd\". Police in the town of Broomfield posted pictures of what appeared to be the front of an engine-casing in the front garden of a home. Other fragments were seen around the town, including on a football field. No-one was injured by the falling debris. In Japan, all 777s with the Pratt & Whitney 4000 model engines are to avoid its airspace until further notice. This includes take-offs, landings and flights over the country.  The government there has also ordered JAL and ANA airlines to suspend the use of its 777s with the same model engine. Last December a JAL flight was forced to return to Naha Airport due to a malfunction in the left engine - the plane is the same age as the 26-year-old United Airlines plane from Saturday's incident.  In 2018, the right engine of a United Airlines plane broke shortly before it landed in Honolulu. Following an investigation, the NTSB said the incident was caused by a full-length fan blade fracture.

            "text": "Cathay Pacific has said its annual loss for last year narrowed to as little as HK$5.6bn (\u00a3530m; $720m) even as Hong Kong remained under tight coronavirus travel restrictions. It is much smaller than 2020's loss and far less than analysts forecast. The improvement was driven by strong cargo demand and cost cutting measures. However, the company said it expects to burn up to HK$1.5bn of cash a month starting February, after aircrew quarantine rules were tightened again. \"While passenger travel continued to be acutely affected, cargo demand was strong throughout the year,\" Cathay Pacific's chief executive Augustus Tang said in a statement. The airline forecast it would post an annual loss of HK$5.6bn to HK$6.1bn for 2021. That was much better than market expectations of a loss of more than HK$10bn as well as the HK$21.65bn loss seen in 2020. Looking ahead to this year, Cathay forecast it would lose between HK$1bn to HK$1.5bn a month due to stricter aircrew quarantine regulations which will force it to further reduce cargo and passenger capacity. The airline said for this month it is operating about 2% of its pre-pandemic passenger capacity and around 20% of its pre-pandemic cargo capacity. \"Regrettably, the capacity reduction will have an impact on Cathay Pacific's business and we have been evaluating the potential impact of these measures on our operations and cost base,\" Mr Tang said. Hong Kong, which has been pursuing a zero-Covid strategy in line with mainland Chinese policies, has suspended transit flights from most of the world. Last month, the Asian financial hub's government announced even stricter quarantine rules after two Cathay aircrew members who broke self-isolation measures were blamed for a Covid-19 outbreak. Last week, Hong Kong police said that the two former flight attendants have been arrested and charged for allegedly breaking the city's coronavirus restrictions. The airline they worked for has not been named but the news came after Cathay fired two aircrew who were suspected of breaching Covid rules. Cathay pilots have previously told the BBC how the rules have affected their mental health and put a strain on their personal lives, with one saying that he was \"in a perpetual state of quarantine.\"",

It was also claimed it \"walked away\" from settlement talks and that the row damaged the \"special relationship\" between the UK and the US. Boeing representatives have been giving evidence to MPs at the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee. Bombardier's C-Series jet is facing huge US import tariffs due to the row. Heavy import taxes have been proposed by the he US Department of Commerce after a complaint by Boeing about illegal UK and Canadian state aid. It followed a C-Series order by US airline Delta. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Ian Paisley said such was Boeing's huge backlog of aircraft orders, it was complaining about \"lost sales (to Bombardier) it could not actually fulfil\". He added: \"For the ordinary punter in the street it is not commercial, it is spiteful.\" Mr Paisley also claimed Boeing had \"walked away\" from settlement talks in June. Boeing's European president, Sir Michael Arthur, responded: \"We would be very happy for this to be settled in accordance with the law. \"We have been trying to get through this. We want a solution.\" Its communications director, Matthew Knowles,  added: \"It is Bombardier in the dock here for violating trade law.\" Independent Unionist MP, Lady Sylvia Hermon, said the dispute threatened jobs in Northern Ireland and its economy. She felt Boeing was also taking advantage of President Donald Trump's 'America First' policy and that the row is damaging the \"special relationship\" between the UK and US. Sir Michael responded: \"The press and others have made a lot of headlines about this. \"We feel we have become a scapegoat for other wider issues. We are trying to keep this on a legal basis.  \"It is not for us to do politics.\" About 1,000 people are involved in making wings for the C-Series plane in Northern Ireland. During preliminary hearings in September, the US Department of Commerce imposed a 220% tariff on Bombardier, relating to subsidies it got from Canada and the UK.  This was followed by an additional 80% tariff in October.",

            "text": "A father who lost his whole family in the March Boeing crash, said he misses them \"every minute of every day\". Paul Njoroge said he has \"nightmares about how (his children) must have clung to their mother crying\" during the doomed flight. The Canadian's wife, three children and mother-in-law were on the Boeing 737 Max that crashed after take-off. The loss of the Ethiopian Airlines' flight was the second fatal accident involving a 737 Max in five months.  A near identical aircraft, owned by the Indonesian carrier Lion Air, went down in the sea off Jakarta in October 2018. The 737 airplane model has been grounded since then. Boeing's decision not to ground the 737 Max after the first crash is now under scrutiny. In emotional testimony to US Congress, Mr Njoroge said: \"All I could think about was the 737 Max struggling to gain height and eventually diving to the ground, killing my whole family and 152 others. Every minute of every day they would be all around me, full of life and health. I miss them every minute of every day.\" He said the airplane manufacturer - which has apologised publicly to the victims' families - had not apologised personally. \"Boeing have not to apologised to us personally. No letters. They have not reached out to us at all. \"They appear on cameras to apologise to us,\" he said.  Also sitting at the witness bench with Mr Njoroge was Michael Stumo whose 24-year-old daughter, Samya Rose Stumo, was also killed. They are part of a group of families who are pushing Boeing, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the US government for answers.  \"On April 4, three weeks after the deaths of my family, in what I have since learned is a shameful pattern of behaviour by Boeing and airplane manufacturers, Boeing shifted focus from the root cause of the crashes - the design flaws in the 737 Max and MCAS - and started talking about 'foreign pilot error',\" Mr Njoroge said. Congressman Sam Graves at a hearing in Washington in May argued that \"facts in the preliminary report reveal pilot error as a factor\". The discussion about foreign pilots being responsible for the crash has angered the families.  Mr Njoroge told the hearing: \"Would they have used the term \"domestic pilot error\" if the crash happened in the United States? The term 'foreign pilot error' is utter prejudice and a disrespect to pilots and Boeing customers across the world\". Boeing and its relationship with the FAA is also a key battleline for the families.  Under an arrangement formed in 2005, the FAA delegated to Boeing the authority to perform some safety-certification work on its behalf.  The families said they believe the FAA \"recklessly left Boeing to police itself\".   \"If Boeing's wrongful conduct continues, another plane will dive to the ground killing me or you or your children or other members of your family. It is you who must be the leaders in this fight for aviation safety in the world,\" said Mr Njoroge said. After the crash in March, it was revealed by insiders that pilots had trained to fly the 737 Max, a new version of the 737, after completing an iPad course that lasted an hour.  The \"families demand that the 737 Max 8 be fully re-certified as a new plane because it is too different from the original certified plane. We demand that simulator training be required,\" Mr Njoroge told Congress. The biggest question in global aviation is when will the 737 Max begin to fly again? Just this week, major airlines in the US confirmed they'll be out of service until at least November, maybe even 2020. In response to the points made at the congressional hearing, Boeing said: \"We truly regret the loss of lives in both of these accidents and we are deeply sorry for the impact to the families and loved ones of those on board.  \"These incidents and the lives lost will continue to weigh heavily on our hearts and on our minds for years to come. We are committed to working with the communities, customers and the aviation industry to help with the healing process.\"",

            "text": "US regulators have uncovered a possible new flaw in Boeing's troubled 737 Max aircraft that is likely to push back test flights. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it had identified the \"potential risk\" during simulator tests, but did not reveal details. Boeing's top-selling aircraft was grounded in March after two crashes. The company is upgrading the aircraft's flight control system, which is the focus of crash investigators. The control system can help prevent a plane from stalling.  In a tweet, the FAA said: \"On the most recent issue, the FAA's process is designed to discover and highlight potential risks. The FAA recently found a potential risk that Boeing must mitigate.\" A source familiar with the situation told the BBC: \"\"During simulator testing last week at Boeing, FAA test pilots discovered an issue that affected their ability to quickly and easily follow the required recovery procedures for runaway stabiliser trim (ie, to stop stabilisers on the aircraft's tail moving uncontrollably). \"The issue was traced to how data is being processed by the flight computer.\" Last month, the FAA indicated that approval of Boeing's changes to the 737 Max could come in late June. That would have allowed test flights in early July.  There were initial hopes among airlines that the 737 Max would be back in the air during the summer, but that timetable was pushed back to late this year even before the latest news.    Reuters, which first reported the new issue, said during an FAA pilot simulation in which the software was activated, it had taken longer than expected to recover the aircraft. Other sources said the problem was linked to the aircraft's computing power and whether the processor possessed enough capacity to keep up.  Boeing said \"we are working closely with the FAA to safely return the Max to service\" and that it believed a software fix would address the problem.  But the FAA will be looking into whether it is a hardware issue. If regulators are unsatisfied with the software fix, the microprocessor unit will have to be replaced and the grounding may stretch on for months longer than previously thought.   The loss of Ethiopian flight ET302 in March was the second fatal accident involving a 737 Max in the space of five months. A near identical aircraft, owned by the Indonesian carrier Lion Air, went down in the sea off Jakarta in October 2018. Theo Leggett, business correspondent The news that the FAA has found a \"potential risk\" in software developed for the 737 Max should come as no surprise. Firstly, fixing the plane is clearly not a simple process. Boeing has been working on the issue for the past eight months - and if a quick and easy solution had been available, perhaps the second of the two accidents could have been avoided.  Meanwhile, the regulator itself is under intense pressure and its credibility is at stake. Its own actions certifying the aircraft and its relationship with Boeing have come under fierce scrutiny.  In deciding whether the aircraft is safe to fly again, it needs to be absolutely rigorous - and needs to be seen to be rigorous as well.  There's a great deal at stake here. The longer the 737 Max remains grounded, the more the costs will mount up, for Boeing and for the airlines which were counting on using the new plane.  But 346 lives have already been lost, and no-one - not Boeing, not the airlines and not the regulator - can afford another accident.  Preliminary reports into both accidents have suggested they were triggered by a flight control system deploying at the wrong time, due to a faulty sensor. The FAA has been criticised for its lack of oversight and the certification process that cleared the Max to fly. Earlier this month, Capt Chesley Sullenberger, whose landing of a crippled aircraft on New York's Hudson River was turned into a Hollywood film, told a Congressional hearing into the 737 Max that the \"crashes are demonstrable evidence that our current system of design and certification has failed us\". Airlines, regulatory authorities and equipment makers met in Montreal on Wednesday to discuss the Boeing 737 Max situation, a gathering organised by industry trade group the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Following the meeting, IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac said: \"The Boeing 737 Max tragedies weigh heavily on an industry that holds safety as its top priority. \"We trust the Federal Aviation Administration, in its role as the certifying regulator, to ensure the aircraft's safe return to service. And we respect the duty of regulators around the world to make independent decisions on FAA's recommendations. \"At the same time, aviation is a globally integrated system that relies on global standards, including mutual recognition, trust, and reciprocity among safety regulators.  \"Aviation cannot function efficiently without this co-ordinated effort, and restoring public confidence demands it.\"",

            "text": "Boeing has said it expects its troubled 737 Max aircraft to return to the skies before the end of the year. The jet was grounded after two fatal crashes, including last year's Lion Air disaster which killed 189 people. Just hours after Indonesian investigators blamed mechanical and design problems for the crash, Boeing said it had developed software updates. The investigators focused on a system used to improve handling and prevent stalling on the Boeing 737 Max. The official report by the Indonesian authorities into the disaster, which occurred 13 minutes after take-off from Jakarta on 29 October 2018, is expected to be published on Friday. But on Wednesday, the authorities informed the victims' families of the findings. Boeing did not comment ahead of formal publication of the report. But according to the information provided to the families, mechanical and design problems with the flight control system were among the causes of the crash. The report highlighted issues with the MCAS (Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System), which was designed to make the aircraft easier to fly. Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee told families that MCAS would be a \"contributing factor\". According to reports, families have been told that there were incorrect assumptions about how the MCAS control system would behave and that the \"deficiencies\" had been highlighted during training. Slides from the briefing to the families showed that there was a lack of documentation about how a \"stick shaker\" - warning pilots of a loss of lift - would work. Reuters reported that a \"stick shaker\" was warning of a stall throughout the 13 minutes the plane was in air, with investigators believing this was based on erroneous data on its angle to the oncoming air. \"During the design and certification of the [737 Max], assumptions were made about pilot response to malfunctions which, even though consistent with current industry guidelines, turned out to be incorrect,\" the report said, according to AFP. The report found the system relied on a sole sensor for inputs and that a replaced sensor had been \"miscalibrated\" during an earlier repair. The planes were grounded after an Ethiopian Airlines crash in March 2019, which took the death toll to 346 people. Boeing said on Wednesday it was working with regulators to return the jet to service. \"Our top priority remains the safe return to service of the 737 Max, and we're making steady progress,\" Boeing boss Dennis Muilenburg said. The firm said it had also developed a training update and that it expected regulators to allow the planes to take off again before the beginning of 2020. \"We've also taken action to further sharpen our company's focus on product and services safety, and we continue to deliver on customer commitments and capture new opportunities, with our values of safety, quality and integrity always at the forefront,\" Mr Muilenburg said. The grounding of the 737 Max hurt the planemaker's financial results in the third quarter.  Profits more than halved to $895m (\u00a3694m) and the firm said it would cut production of its 787 Dreamliner, blaming trade uncertainties. Mr Muilenberg was stripped of his title as chairman by the board earlier this month, but remains as chief executive. On Tuesday, Boeing ousted Kevin McAllister, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, becoming the most senior official to leave since the two crashes. Mr Muilenburg is under pressure to explain what the company knew about issues with the 737 Max. Questions about how much Boeing knew about problems with the 737 Max have been raised since Boeing provided documents to US lawmakers that showed employees had exchanged instant messages about issues with MCAS as it was being certified in 2016. A pilot wrote that he had run into unexpected trouble during tests, saying he \"basically lied to the regulators [unknowingly]\". The documents were provided ahead of Mr Muilenburg's appearance before Congress next week. The testimony from relatives of those on board Lion Air flight 610 raises yet more uncomfortable questions about the design of the 737 Max. And the focus remains on the aircraft's new flight control system, known as MCAS, which erroneously pushed the plane into a nosedive.  The notion that assumptions made by Boeing and the regulators who signed the aircraft off about how that system would perform and how pilots would react to it were \"incorrect\" suggests something went badly wrong.  Every air crash is a chain of events and according to the families, the actions of the pilots were also a factor.  But the vulnerability of the MCAS system, which previously relied on data from one single sensor, is again in the spotlight.  The departure of Kevin McAllister, who ran Boeing's commercial planes division, speaks of the wider fallout.  The fundamental question belying everything is: why was more drastic action not taken after the Lion Air crash before a second accident killed another 157 people and grounded the plane worldwide?",

            "title": "Ryanair to cut flights after 737 Max delays",
            "text": "Ryanair has said it will be forced to cut the number of summer flights it operates next year blaming further expected delays before the Boeing 737 Max is allowed to fly again. The airline said it could be as late as December before regulators clear the aircraft to return to the skies after two fatal crashes. It was awaiting delivery of 58 planes before next summer but it now expects to receive just over half of those. It could also close bases as a result. The airline said it was in talks with airports about which of its hubs could suffer cuts. \"We are starting a series of discussions with our airports to determine which of Ryanair's underperforming or loss making bases should suffer these short term cuts and/or closures from November 2019,\" the airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said in a statement. Ryanair added that it would talk to its staff and unions about the planned closures, which it said were \"directly caused\" by the delays delivering the 737 Max. The airline is now expecting to carry 157 million passengers in the year to March 2021, five million fewer than it had been planning for. The BBC has seen a letter which Ryanair sent to pilots last week.  It says the \"economic backdrop for European short haul airlines continues to be very challenging.\" As a result of the grounding of the 737 Max the airline says it has a surplus of around 300 pilots which \"may get worse with any knock-on effect of Max delivery delays\".  By Theo Leggett , BBC international business correspondent It's looking increasingly unlikely that the 737 Max will be flying again before late autumn - and quite possibly not before next year. So should we be surprised? In a word, no. The stakes are too high, and this is one decision the regulators simply can't afford to get wrong. The Federal Aviation Administration has already faced heavy criticism for allowing the aircraft into service in its original form, with flight control software that has been implicated in two separate accidents and the loss of 346 lives. A repeat would be simply unthinkable - and for the sake of its own reputation the FAA not only needs to be thorough but to be seen to be thorough. So its analysis appears to have gone well beyond the fresh software developed to solve the original problem - and is now addressing a range of other potential issues.  Boeing does desperately want to get the 737 Max flying again and resume deliveries to customers - it's running out of parking space at its Renton factory for a start. Airlines also need the new plane.  But the message from the FAA has been consistent: it will lift the ban on flying \"when we deem it is safe to do so\". Airline analyst Chris Tarry told the BBC that the move to cut routes was \"entirely predictable\" after the 737 Max was grounded. He said the plane was \"unlikely, even with a following wind, to return to the skies before the end of the year\". There's a finite number of aircraft that Ryanair can use, he said, explaining that the airline would use those planes on the most profitable routes. Another airline expert, John Strickland, said the grounding was likely to have an effect on the airline's growth plans. At present Ryanair has around 455 planes but it plans to expand its fleet to roughly 600 by 2025. \"A lot of it is about limiting growth rather than cutting back,\" he said. \"In the summer they would have expected to grow strongly, having additional bases and additional routes.\" No Max planes have flown since March after issues with its software were linked to crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, which killed 346 people. Ryanair has a total of 135 of the controversial Boeing models on order, the first five of which are due for delivery this autumn. It has become the latest airline to cancel flights as a result of the aircraft's grounding.  On Sunday, American Airlines said it was extending for a fourth time cancellations of about 115 daily flights. The cancellations will now continue into early November due to the continued grounding of the 737 Max. However, the firm added: \"American Airlines remains confident that impending software updates to the Boeing 737 Max, along with the new training elements Boeing is developing in coordination with our union partners, will lead to recertification of the aircraft this year.\" But airlines are still putting in orders for the aircraft. At the Paris airshow last month, International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways, announced plans to buy 200 Max planes at a discount, referring to them as \"B737 aircraft\". Boeing has yet to convince regulators that updates to its software are enough to ensure the Max's safety. And last month the US Federal Aviation Administration, which must reapprove the jets for flight, uncovered a new flaw that Boeing estimates will take until at least September to fix.",

            "text": "Flyadeal, the low-cost Saudi Arabian airline, has cancelled an order for 30 Boeing 737 Max aircraft. The decision follows the crashes of two 737 Max jets, the first in Indonesia in October followed by one in Ethiopia in March, which killed 346 people. Since then the aircraft has been grounded and Boeing has been working on a fix that will satisfy regulators. Boeing said that flyadeal had decided not to go ahead with the provisional order because of \"schedule requirements\". The deal, which included an additional option to purchase 20 more 737 Max aircraft, was worth $5.9bn at list prices, but the airline would have been offered a discount on that price tag. Instead flyadeal, which is controlled by state-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines, will operate a fleet of Airbus A320 planes. The loss of Ethiopian Airlines' flight ET302 in March was the second fatal accident involving a 737 Max in the space of five months. A near identical aircraft, owned by the Indonesian carrier Lion Air, went down in the sea off Jakarta in October 2018. Crash investigators have concentrated their efforts on the aircraft's control system and Boeing has been working with regulators to roll out a software upgrade. There is no date when the aircraft might be cleared to fly again. Last week Boeing announced that it would give $100m to help families affected by the two crashes. The payment, stretching over several years, is independent of lawsuits filed in the wake of the disasters, which together killed 346 people. Lawyers for victims' families dismissed the move. Last month IAG said it intended to buy 200 Boeing 737 Max aircraft. While not a firm order, it was seen as a boost for Boeing. The planes would be used by IAG's airlines including British Airways, Vueling and Level. The letter of intent was signed at the Paris Air Show. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh said at the time: \"We have every confidence in Boeing and expect that the aircraft will make a successful return to service in the coming months having received approval from the regulators\".",

            "text": "Plane maker Boeing plans to cut about 2,000 jobs in finance and human resources this year, as it focuses on engineering and manufacturing. The move comes as the company puts more of its resources into \"products, services and technology development\". It will outsource some of the roles to Tata Consulting Services, a unit of one of India's largest conglomerates. Boeing has faced a number of issues in recent years, including the grounding of its 737 Max after two fatal crashes. \"We have and will continue to communicate transparently with our teams that we expect lower staffing within some corporate support functions,\" the company told the BBC. \"As always, we will support affected teammates and provide assistance and resources to support their transition,\" it added. Around a third of the jobs will be outsourced to Tata Consulting Services, which is based in Bangalore (also known as Bengaluru). However, Boeing also said that it will continue to increase its headcount \"with a focus on engineering and manufacturing\". On top of the 15,000 people it hired in 2022, the company said it aims to recruit another 10,000 this year. The aviation giant has been working to turn itself around after its 737 Max passenger jet was grounded worldwide after two fatal accidents. On 29 October 2018, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the Java Sea 13 minutes after taking off from Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, killing all 189 passengers and crew. Less than five months later, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, another Boeing 737 Max on its way to Kenya, crashed six minutes after leaving Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa. All 157 people on board were killed. It later emerged that both accidents were triggered by design flaws, in particular the use of flight control software known as the \"Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System\" (MCAS). The system was designed to assist pilots familiar with previous generations of the 737, and prevent them from needing costly extra training in order to fly the new model. But sensor failures caused it to malfunction, and in both cases it forced the aircraft into a catastrophic dive the pilots were unable to prevent. After modifications to the aircraft and pilot training, the 737 Max aircraft has now been cleared to fly again in most countries around the world.",

            "text": " The death toll of Cuba's deadliest air disaster in 30 years has risen to 111 after one of the survivors died of her injuries on Monday evening. Grettel Landrove, 23, was a flamenco dancer and student engineer.  The news comes on the same day that Mexico's civil air authority suspended the operations of a company that owned the plane involved in the crash. Officials said in a statement that Aerol\u00edneas Damojh was under \"extraordinary verification\". The charter company had leased the aeroplane in question to Cuban state airlines Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n. Speaking to the BBC outside the hospital, Ms Landrove's mother, Amparo Font, described her daughter as a fighter. But her death was announced shortly afterwards. Ms Landrove was one of three initial survivors of Friday's crash. The other two - Mailen Diaz, 19, and Emiley Sanchez, 39 - remain in a critical condition, according to reports.  The plane was reportedly built in 1979. One former pilot said it had dropped off radar once, while another alleged that maintenance was poor. The Mexican General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) statement, in Spanish, says the authority will seek information to help the crash investigation, and about whether the Mexican company continues to follow regulations. It says Aerol\u00edneas Damojh was subject to previous investigations: in 2010, due to a crash in Puerto Vallarta, and in 2013 following a complaint from an airline pilot.  The authority has run \"annual checks\" on Aerol\u00edneas Damojh, the statement reads, with the most recent in November 2017. All aircraft have to renew their airworthiness certificates every two years.  The head of Guyana's civil aviation body, Cpt Egbert Field, told the Associated Press news agency that the plane that crashed had been barred from using Guyanese airspace last year after authorities found its crew were overloading luggage on flights in Cuba. In one instance, the news agency reports, Guyanese authorities had discovered suitcases stored in the plane's toilets. The plane crashed after taking off from Havana airport. It was a scheduled internal flight to the Cuban town of Holguin.  All six crew members were Mexican, while the majority of passengers were Cuban. An Argentine couple and two passengers from the dispute territory of Western Sahara were also killed, as was a Mexico tourist. ",

            "text": "The government remains committed to sending asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda and plans for future flights have begun, Priti Patel has told MPs.  \"We will not be deterred from doing the right thing,\" the home secretary said. The first flight was cancelled minutes before take-off after an intervention by the European Court of Human Rights. Labour's Yvette Cooper said the government knew there were \"torture and trafficking victims\" among those the government planned to put on the plane. The shadow home secretary called the policy a \"shambles\" and \"shameful\". The Rwanda asylum plan, announced by the government in April, intends to take some asylum seekers who cross the Channel to the UK on a one-way ticket to Rwanda to claim asylum there instead. The government has said the scheme would discourage others from crossing the Channel.  Up to seven people had been expected to be removed to Rwanda on the Boeing 767 on Tuesday evening.  But despite clearing UK courts, the flight was halted by a late intervention from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Two asylum seekers who were expected to board the flight have told an Iranian human rights lawyer they were treated like criminals and described one man being taken to the plane in a wheelchair after passing out. Shadi Sadr, of Justice for Iran, told the BBC the pair said they had been held in separate vans at the airport, each with three guards. One said they had been handcuffed, the other that their hand had been tied to a seat in the van, she said. \"They were already traumatised by their journeys here and the uncertainties of what was happening to them - it's an inhuman way to treat people,\" she told the BBC. Mitie, the facilities management company which runs immigration centres and was escorting the asylum seekers to the plane, said that restraint was only used as a last resort, to ensure the safety of both those travelling and its staff members. \"This includes the prevention of injury or self-harm,\" its statement added. \"Our focus is on treating the people in our care with dignity and respect, and we are confident that our officers have acted professionally.\" Speaking in the Commons, Home Secretary Ms Patel defended the policy and said the court ruling was \"disappointing and surprising\".  \"We believe that we are fully compliant with our domestic and international obligations, and preparations for our future flights and the next flights have already begun.\"  She said: \"We will not stand idly by and let organised crime gangs, who are despicable in their nature and their conduct, evil people, treat human beings as cargo. \"We will not accept that we have no right to control our borders\", she said, explaining that the government has been reforming its systems to make them \"firm\" and \"fair\".  The flight had been due to take off at 22:30 BST from a military airport in Wiltshire on Tuesday, but a judgement from the ECHR in Strasbourg halting the deportation of one of the men arrived at just after 19:30. The Strasbourg human rights court - which is not a European Union body but is part of the Council of Europe, which still has the UK as a member - said an Iraqi man known as KN faced \"a real risk of irreversible harm\" if he remained on the flight. The court said he should not be sent to Rwanda until the Supreme Court delivered its full decision on whether the government's policy was legal, which is due in July. That decision in KN's case led the remaining men to appeal - some to judges in London - and ultimately, all the removal orders were scrapped. Echoing the home secretary's words, the Rwandan government said it was \"not deterred\" by the failure of the first flight and it remained committed to the deal with the UK.  The ECHR is an international court that sits in Strasbourg in France and protects civil and political rights. These rights were established in a treaty called the European Convention on Human Rights, drawn up in the aftermath of World War Two - largely written by British civil servants and lawyers. The convention has nothing to do with the EU - so the UK remains part of it despite Brexit.  The British government is bound by ECHR rulings, including the injunction that prevented a passenger from boarding a flight to Rwanda.  The ECHR should not to be confused with the European Court of Justice - which is a separate court that settles disputes between EU members.  It's extremely rare for a country to withdraw from the ECHR's jurisdiction. Russia was expelled following its invasion of Ukraine, Greece temporarily left following a military coup, while Belarus is not part of the Convention. The government said 444 migrants had tried to cross the English Channel in small boats on Tuesday, the highest number in a single day for two months. In the Commons, Labour denounced the government's policy to pass asylum decisions to Rwanda, calling it \"government by gimmick\" and a \"short-term stunt\". \"How shameful does that make us look around the world?\" asked Ms Cooper, shadow home secretary. Human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC said: \"One of the things that makes Britain great\u2026 is that we will abide by international courts and international law.\" He said \"lawyers at many chambers\" took the case to the ECHR and it decided the government should not deport any individuals \"until the judicial review had concluded and had approved the lawfulness of the policy\". Judicial reviews are a type of court case that allows members of the public to challenge the legality of a government decision, but they cannot overturn entire acts of Parliament passed by MPs.  \"So it shouldn't have come as any surprise to the government because it's well known that when domestic remedies in the British courts are exhausted, you can go to the European court,\" said Mr Robertson. The government now had a number of choices, he told the BBC, including asking the court to lift the measures, fighting the judicial review or bringing a new law to Parliament.   Frances Swaine, another human rights lawyer representing a man facing deportation to Rwanda, said she understood people's frustration that the flight had been cancelled - but she hoped they wouldn't want to do something illegal. An assessment was now needed on whether anybody else could be sent there before the July hearing on the policy, she said. Migration Watch UK, which campaigns for lower immigration into the UK, said the flight cancellation was outrageous and the public wanted UK parliament and courts to make the decisions - not \"remote human rights judges\".

            "text": "Relatives of people killed in the Boeing 737 Max crash in Indonesia last year have been cheated out of compensation, their lawyers say. Lawyers told the BBC that many families were persuaded to sign forms preventing them from taking legal action. BBC Panorama has discovered that other relatives signed similar agreements after two other crashes, stopping them from suing Boeing in the US courts.   Boeing has declined to comment on the agreements. All 189 passengers and crew died when the Boeing 737 Max crashed into the sea just 13 minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, on 29 October 2018. Within weeks, relatives were offered compensation by insurance lawyers. To access the money, families had to sign agreements that would prevent them from taking legal action against Boeing or the airline, Lion Air. Merdian Agustin's husband, Eka, was killed in the crash. She says the insurance lawyers tried to pressure her into signing away her rights. \"They give me some document to sign. The document said you can have the money but you can't sue Lion Air. You can't sue Boeing. \"They said you should sign this. You should move forward. In one hour or two hours you will get the money and you will continue life, but I don't want it. It's not about the money. It's about my husband's life\", she said.  Ms Agustin did not sign, but it is believed around 50 families did. They will get compensation of just under \u00a374,000 ($92,000) each.  The payouts are controversial because under Indonesian law the families are automatically entitled to \u00a371,000 compensation. Sanjiv Singh, an American lawyer representing some of the families, told the BBC relatives had been pressured into signing away their legal rights. \"The families who signed the release and discharge [documents] have been cheated out of compensation, they've been preyed upon by insurance companies and by the counsel for those insurance companies, and ultimately, to the benefit of Boeing\" he said. He added that families were potentially entitled to millions of dollars in compensation. This is not the first time that Boeing has benefited from controversial release and discharge documents. In 2005, a Boeing 737 crashed into a residential area in Indonesia, killing 149 people. Families signed agreements which prevented them from suing Boeing in the US courts.  Similar agreements were signed after a 737 crash that killed 102 passengers and crew in 2007. One unnamed insurance lawyer was involved on all three occasions. Mr Singh says this raises serious questions about whether Boeing was involved in the more recent Lion Air agreements. \"I think that makes it implausible that Boeing, at the very least, didn't know that the releases were being collected. I think it raises a very significant question as to whether they co-ordinated it.\" Panorama asked Boeing if it knew about the agreements or had any communication with the insurance lawyers who helped organise them.   Boeing did not answer any of the questions posed by the Panorama programme, instead releasing a statement which said: \"Boeing truly regrets the loss of life and will continue to work with communities, customers and the aviation industry to help with the healing process.  \"The insurers for Boeing are in discussions with other insurers around the world, as is typical and customary in circumstances such as these.\" The lead insurer for both Lion Air and Boeing is the British insurance firm Global Aerospace.  Global Aerospace disputed the allegations but declined to comment on the specifics because of client confidentiality. It said: \"It is common for aviation insurers to have insured more than one party that is involved in some way in an accident. \"Global Aerospace, in accordance with industry best practice, strictly divides responsibility for the handling of different clients to ensure that they are each represented separately and that no inappropriate sharing of information takes place in the handling of any claims that may occur.\" The company said it was standard practice when settling claims to release the airline and plane manufacturers from future claims. On 3 July, Boeing announced it would provide $100m to help communities and families affected by the two recent 737 Max accidents. The second was in Ethiopia in April, when 157 people died. Lawyers for the families say they have not been given details about how that money would be used.",

            "text": "A firm which lost a satellite on Virgin Orbit's failed Spaceport Cornwall launch said UK space regulation needs to undergo \"seismic change\". Parliament's Science and Technology Committee heard \"devastating\" evidence from Space Forge, based in Cardiff. The company had one of nine satellites on board the 'Start Me Up' mission that failed to reach orbit in January. Greg Clark, committee chairman, said evidence showed regulation was putting the UK \"behind the rest of the world\".  UK space regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), said changes could be made but safety was \"not negotiable\". Meanwhile, Melissa Quinn, Head of Spaceport Cornwall, told the committee the fact they had \"got to space\" for the first time ever from a \"small regional airport\" in Cornwall was \"inspirational\". She added that they were \"licensed and ready\" for a second launch.  A dislodged fuel filter was behind January's failure of the first attempt to launch satellites into orbit from the UK, Virgin Orbit said. MPs heard the CAA's regulatory procedure could deter future missions.  Patrick McCall, non-executive director at Space Forge, said: \"The CAA is taking a different approach to risk, and a bit to process and timing as well. \"But I think unless there is, without wanting to be too dramatic, a seismic change in that approach, the UK is not going to be competitive from a launch perspective.\" Joshua Western, chief executive of the company, told the committee: \"Quite frankly it costs us more to licence our satellite for launch than it did to launch it.\" He said the portal for applications and email correspondence was taking up to six weeks, suggesting there is a lack of engagement with UK authorities. Spaceport Cornwall was awarded an operating licence in November 2022, but further technical and regulatory issues meant the launch was pushed into 2023.  The licences for Virgin Orbit were granted on 21 December, with additional ones for the individual satellites being announced on 5 January. The Start Me Up mission launched on 9 January, and was progressing as planned until an \"anomaly\" meant the payload  being carried by the LauncherOne rocket were lost into the Atlantic Ocean. Greg Clark, chairman of the committee told CAA representatives the evidence from Space Forge and Virgin Orbit had been \"devastating\".  He said: \"Something that was a strategic priority for this country to be ahead of the world, we've heard evidence from investors and operators to say that their experience of regulation here has put us behind the rest of the world.\" Sir Stephen Hillier, chairman of the CAA, said the regulator had to enact the legislation but conceded licence applicants had to deal with \"multifarious agencies\". He said safety was not negotiable, but welcomed encouragement to \"move faster\". Tim Johnson, director for space regulation at the CAA, said: \"Helping develop a safe and thriving UK space industry is a key part of our work as the space regulator.\" Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

A Boeing spokesman said the company did not see the issue further delaying the jet's return to service. It comes as the 737 Max remains grounded after two fatal crashes. The US plane maker said it discovered so-called \"Foreign Object Debris\" left inside the wing fuel tanks of several undelivered 737 Maxs. A company spokesman told the BBC: \"While conducting maintenance we discovered Foreign Object Debris (FOD) in undelivered 737 Max airplanes currently in storage. That finding led to a robust internal investigation and immediate corrective actions in our production system.\" Foreign Object Debris is a technical term that covers any substance, debris or article that isn't part of a plane which would potentially cause damage.  The revelation is the latest in a string of problems affecting what was once Boeing's best-selling plane. The aircraft has been grounded by regulators around the world since March 2019. It was banned from flying after two separate crashes killed 346 people. The US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), told the BBC that it was monitoring the plane maker's response to the new issue: \"The FAA is aware that Boeing is conducting a voluntary inspection of undelivered aircraft for Foreign Object Debris (FOD) as part of the company's ongoing efforts to ensure manufacturing quality.  \"The agency increased its surveillance based on initial inspection reports and will take further action based on the findings,\" it added. Boeing said it didn't expect the issue to cause any fresh delays to the 737 Max's return to service, which the company said could happen by the middle of this year.",

            "title": "Boeing admits knowing of 737 Max problem",
            "text": "Boeing has admitted that it knew about a problem with its 737 Max jets a year before the aircraft was involved in two fatal accidents, but took no action. The firm said it had inadvertently made an alarm feature optional instead of standard, but insisted that this did not jeopardise flight safety. All 737 Max planes were grounded in March after an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed, killing 157 people. Five months earlier, 189 people were killed in a Lion Air crash. The worldwide fleet of 737 Max planes totalled 387 aircraft at the time of the grounding. The feature at issue is known as the Angle of Attack (AOA) Disagree alert and was designed to let pilots know when two different sensors were reporting conflicting data. The planemaker said it had intended to provide the feature as standard, but did not realise until deliveries had begun that it was only available if airlines purchased an optional indicator. It said it had intended to deal with the problem in a later software update. Boeing maintained that the software problem \"did not adversely impact airplane safety or operation\". The US Federal Aviation Administration told Reuters news agency that Boeing had not informed it of the software issue until November 2018, a month after the Lion Air crash. The FAA said the issue was \"low risk\", but said Boeing could have helped to \"eliminate possible confusion\" by letting it know earlier. The flight angle of the plane has been identified as a factor in the disasters. Boeing has said that in both fatal crashes, erroneous AOA data was fed to the jet's Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), an anti-stall system which has come under scrutiny since the crashes.  Boeing is developing new software for MCAS. Theo Leggett, business correspondent Boeing has admitted it was aware of a flaw on board the 737 Max months before the first accident, involving a Lion Air jet off the coast of Indonesia.  But was that flaw a factor in that accident? Would a working \"AOA Disagree\" alert actually have made any difference? It's highly unlikely.  All it would have told the pilots was that the two angle-of-attack sensors aboard the plane were giving very different readings.  This mattered, because the MCAS system, which has been implicated in the crash, relied on data from a single sensor. A fault in that sensor may well have been the trigger for the crash. But the pilots did not even know MCAS existed. It was a system designed to improve the handling of the aircraft and to operate in the background.  In the second accident, the pilots should at least have been aware of MCAS - and the sensor information could possibly have been of some use to them. But given that they did in any case apparently follow procedures set out by Boeing to deal with an MCAS failure, but were still unable to maintain control, it is unlikely to have been a decisive factor. Nevertheless, this will add to the pressure on Boeing - because despite being aware of an issue with the 737 Max, it initially chose not to inform airlines.  Yet as one 737 pilot told me: every warning system is there for a reason, so if you know there's a problem, why would you not fix it? Boeing insists the AOA Disagree alert was not necessary for safe flight.  But critics will be asking whether the company was complacent - and whether there is anything else which the company has chosen not to pass on to its customers, affecting this type of aircraft or its other models.",

            "text": "Boeing has grounded its entire global fleet of 737 Max aircraft after investigators uncovered new evidence at the scene of the fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash. The US plane-maker said it would suspend all 371 of the aircraft. The Federal Aviation Administration said fresh evidence as well as newly refined satellite data prompted the decision to temporarily ban the jets. The FAA had previously held out while many countries banned the aircraft. All 157 passengers and crew died in Sunday's crash. Ethiopian Airlines said on Thursday that the black box flight recorders from the aircraft have been flown to Paris for analysis. \"An Ethiopian delegation led by Accident Investigation Bureau has flown the Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder to Paris, France for investigation,\" the airline wrote on Twitter. The FAA has a team investigating the disaster at the Ethiopian Airlines crash site working with the National Transportation Safety Board. Dan Elwell, acting administrator at the FAA, said on Wednesday: \"It became clear to all parties that the track of the Ethiopian Airlines [flight] was very close and behaved very similarly to the Lion Air flight.\" He added that \"the evidence we found on the ground made it even more likely the flight path was very close to Lion Air's\". President Donald Trump initially announced that the FAA would be making an emergency order following \"new information and physical evidence that we've received from the site and from other locations and through a couple of other complaints\".  The US and Brazil became the latest countries to suspend the Boeing 737 Max from flying after nations including the UK, China, India and Australia all grounded the aircraft. Until Wednesday, the FAA position was that a review had showed \"no systemic performance issues\" and that there was no basis for grounding the aircraft. Earlier in the day, Canada grounded the planes after its transport minister Marc Garneau said he had received new evidence about the crash. He said that satellite data showed possible similarities between flight patterns of Boeing 737 Max planes operating in Canada and the Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed. Boeing, the US plane manufacturer, said that it \"continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max\". However, it added that after consultation with the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board it had decided to ground the flights \"out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public of the aircraft's safety\".  Dennis Muilenburg, president, chief executive and chairman of Boeing, said: \"We are doing everything we can to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators, deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again.\" Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, said: \"Lives must come first always. But a brand is at stake as well. And that brand is not just Boeing. It's America. What America means in international aviation and by extension in the larger world more generally\u2014that we set the standard for safety, competence, and honesty in governance of aviation.\"   Shares in Boeing ticked higher to $377 each following the announcement. However, the company's market value has dropped by nearly $26bn since the crash in Ethiopia at the weekend.     Southwest Airlines said it had immediately removed all 34 of the planes from scheduled service. Although it has the biggest fleet of Boeing 737 Max 8 planes in the world, Southwest Airlines said they account \"for less than 5% of our daily flights\". It said it is offering \"flexible rebooking policies\" which means that any customer booked on a cancelled Max 8 flight can rebook on alternate flights \"without any additional fees or fare differences within 14 days of their original date of travel\". American Airlines said 24 of its aircraft would be affected by the suspension, adding: \"Our teams will be working to rebook customers as quickly as possible, and we apologise for any inconvenience.\" United Airlines said that its Max aircraft account for roughly 40 flights a day. It said: \"Through a combination of spare aircraft and rebooking customers, we do not anticipate a significant operational impact as a result of this order.\" Analysis: Theo Leggett, BBC international business correspondent With other aviation authorities around the world deciding to ground the 737 Max, the FAA - which provides the safety certification for the new aircraft - was under intense pressure to fall into line. What's interesting here, though, is what the FAA has actually said. While the UK's Civil Aviation Authority, for example, said its actions were simply precautionary, the FAA has gone further. The US regulator, which is actually involved in the investigation, says it has made its decision as a result of new evidence collected at the site and analysed today - as well as satellite data. That will have set alarm bells ringing at Boeing's headquarters in Chicago.  Since the accident, analysts have focused on similarities between Sunday's tragedy, and another crash involving a 737 Max off Indonesia last October.  Has the FAA found evidence that suggests those similarities were more than just superficial? And does that mean Boeing's MCAS anti-stall system, already implicated in the Indonesia crash, may also have played a role in the latest disaster? Pilots in the US had complained late last year about problems controlling the Boeing 737 Max 8 during take-off. They reported difficulties similar to those that contributed to the fatal Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October. The Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed minutes into its flight.  Flightradar24, an air traffic monitor, said the plane's \"vertical speed was unstable after take-off\". Documents reveal that pilots flying last November reported engaging autopilot only for the aircraft's nose to pitch lower, prompting the warning system to exclaim: \"Don't sink! Don't sink!\" Two US pilots reported separate incidents involving the 737 Max's automatic anti-stalling system in November. The feature, which was new to the 737 Max family, is designed to keep the plane from stalling. The system prevents the aircraft from pointing upwards at too high an angle, where it could lose its lift. However, according to filings with the US Aviation Safety Reporting System, which pilots use to disclose information anonymously, it appeared to force the nose down. In both cases, pilots were forced to intervene to stop the plane from descending. After the Lion Air crash, Boeing issued a bulletin on what to do regarding erroneous readings from the sensor, which sends out information about what angle a plane is flying at.",

            "title": "United Airlines CEO: Insisting on vaccines \"right thing to do\"",
            "text": "The boss of United Airlines has told the BBC that firing staff who refuse to get a coronavirus vaccine is \"just the right thing to do\". Around 300 of the airline's 67,000 US based staff are yet to comply with the strict policy, after an initial deadline of 27 September. Vaccine hesitancy has been a hugely divisive issue in the US but President Biden recently made it easier for big companies to take a tougher line. CEO Scott Kirby says United's strict policy is \"about saving lives\". He adds that \"when I retire someday, hopefully long in the future, I will look back at this and it will be one of the proudest moments of my career that we've made the tough decision, but the right decision to require vaccines.\" More than 250 staff have complied with United's policy since last week's deadline. A further 2,000 employees have requested an exemption on medical or religious grounds. They haven't all been granted, but final numbers won't be clear until legal processes are resolved. Any dismissal process could take weeks or months as the company says it would follow agreements with trade unions.  Mr Kirby says his airline's experience holds a lesson for other companies too which has been applauded by an \"awful lot\" of customers. \"Despite all the rhetoric and all the challenges that business leaders may think they're going to have with the vaccine requirement, we did it. It was seven weeks from the time we announced it until we finished and we got to 99%.\" Whilst Mr Kirby is pleased about the influence he's been able to have over his staff there is frustration about the lack of a single global system for recognising the Covid vaccine and test status of passengers. The airline trade body, the International Airline Transport Association, is amongst those who have tried to introduce a unified system. \"It's really complicated, and I don't blame governments\", says Mr Kirby. He points out that \"there's different vaccines in different parts of the world, every country has their own regulatory apparatus\".  \"I've never thought that we would get to a world where we had a single system that applied broadly, it'd be great if we could, just it was always impractical\".  So far the pandemic has led to losses of more than $8.7bn at United. Passenger numbers of 38.6m in the first six months of this year point to recovering demand. That is slightly higher than the same time last year, but is only 48.8% of pre-covid levels, when United was the world's fourth biggest airline. The company had been predicting that autumn would bring a return to profitability, but \"the Delta variant caused a setback\", says Mr Kirby. He says that the forthcoming easing of travel restrictions that will essentially reopen transatlantic travel \"is really important for us\". The hope is that the airline will reach \"at least a breakeven [point] at the start of the next year, particularly as we get vaccination rates up, and as Delta variant cases start to come down\". \"Widespread vaccine rollout is crucial to the recovery of the global aviation industry\", says the independent aviation consultant Andrew Charlton. Last year, passenger numbers fell 60% to 1.8 billion and the industry lost $126bn, according to IATA, which said it was the worst year on record. Further big losses are forecast for this year. \"United, like the other big American carriers, have generally coped pretty well with the pandemic\" says Mr Charlton. He explains this is because \"around 75% of their operations are domestic travel which hasn't been disrupted as badly as international flights. Assuming there are no more big shocks that has given them financial resilience to reshape and resize themselves for after the pandemic\". Despite getting more than $10bn of support from the US government to get through the pandemic, much of which has been repaid with private borrowing, the airline is still investing heavily in the future. As well as ordering 270 new aircraft it is planning to launch supersonic flights in 2029, they would be the first commercial flights that are quicker than the speed of sound since Concorde retired in 2003. The planes are being made by Boom Supersonic and are expected to reach speeds of 1,122mph (1,805km/h). Going that fast requires more fuel than conventional aeroplanes, which has led to criticism about their environmental impact. Mr Kirby says \"it's been important that we've worked with Boom Supersonic to develop these aeroplanes in a sustainable way. This will be the first aeroplane, the first aircraft engines ever designed from scratch to run on 100% sustainable aviation fuel\".  Mr Kirby is adamant that there is a need to travel so quickly. \"It's much more productive for you as a business traveller or even as a leisure traveller to get there faster\". But it is business travellers that the airline has in mind for the $200m aircraft. When it comes to the economics, Mr Kirby says \"an all-business class aeroplane at the kinds of business class fares that we charge today is profitable\".  He is resolute that business travel will return in the pandemic despite the rise of video calls. \"Business travel is about human relationships. It's not about the transaction\".  \"I think zoom and technology like this is going to replace phone calls. But it is not going to replace the need to be there in person\". Leisure travel will also recover says Mr Kirby, but he agrees with a recent Boeing forecast that it will take until 2024 for global aviation to fully recover from the pandemic. He predicts domestic US travel, the majority of his business, will lead the way. \"Certainly by 2023, probably by the end of next year, we're back to normal travel between the US and Europe\". But, he adds \"there are parts of the globe that are going to take longer\".  You can watch Scott Kirby's full interview on \"Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst\" this weekend on BBC World News at Saturday 23:30 GMT, Sunday 05:30 and 16:30 GMT, Monday 07:30 GMT and 16:30 GMT and Thursday at 07:30 GMT.",

            "text": "A landing feature was \"inoperative\" on a passenger plane that slid off a runway in the US state of Florida on Friday, investigators have said. The Boeing 737, operated by Miami Air International, ended up in a river after landing during a thunderstorm. Officials said 21 people were taken to hospital with minor injuries, and at least four pets kept in the hold died. They are now looking into the failure of the \"thrust reverser\", as well as a request by the pilot to change runways. The flight, which had flown from Guantanamo Bay in Cuba to a military base in the city of Jacksonville, is said to have landed heavily in the storm before skidding into St John's River.  The 136 passengers and seven crew members on board evacuated the Boeing 737-800 via its wings.  Investigators have obtained the flight data recorder but the cockpit voice recorder remains in a submerged area of the plane.  Authorities must wait until the remaining fuel - around 1,200 gallons (4,500L) - is removed before attempting to salvage any evidence. \"The aircraft had been in maintenance and the maintenance log noted that the left hand thrust reverser was inoperative,\" Bruce Landsberg, vice-chairman of the US National Transportation Safety Board, told a press conference on Sunday. Mr Landsberg added that shortly before they landed, the pilots had asked to change to a runway which had equipment set up on it, and which therefore had less space available. \"We don't know what they were thinking or why that was their choice,\" he said. On Sunday, the Naval Air Station in Jacksonville confirmed that the bodies of a dog and two cats were recovered from the aircraft. Another animal that had travelled in the cabin was removed alive by its owner. One passenger on the plane, Cheryl Bormann, described the \"terrifying\" moment it slid off the runway. \"The plane literally hit the ground and bounced - it was clear the pilot did not have total control of the plane, it bounced again,\" she told CNN. \"We were in the water. We couldn't tell where we were, whether it was a river or an ocean,\" she said, adding that she could smell jet fuel leaking into the river.  In a news conference, Captain Michael Connor, commanding officer at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, said it was a \"miracle\" that there had been no serious injuries or fatalities. Miami Air International is contracted by the US military for its twice-weekly \"rotator\" service between the US mainland and Guantanamo Bay, Bill Dougherty, a base spokesman said.  Officials say the people on Friday's flight included civilian and military personnel. Boeing released a statement sharing its \"well wishes\" with those on board. It said it was providing technical assistance to the US National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident. The aerospace giant has been under increased scrutiny following two fatal crashes involving its 737 Max 8 planes - a different model to the one involved in the incident on Friday.",

            "title": "Boeing-Airbus trade row set to end after 17 years",
            "text": "The US and the EU have agreed a truce in a 17-year trade dispute over subsidies for Boeing and Airbus. Under the agreement, both sides will remove taxes on $11.5bn (\u00a38.2bn) of goods, including wine, cheese and tractors, for five years. Those tariffs, imposed by both sides as punishment in the escalating dispute, had already been suspended in March while they tried to resolve matters. In March the US suspended tariffs on UK imports arising from the dispute. US President Joe Biden had a summit with European Union (EU) leaders on Tuesday, where he is trying to bolster support for his more assertive stance towards Russia and China, and move away from Trump-era trade rows. \"I think we have great opportunities to work closely with the EU as well as Nato and we feel quite good about it,\" President Biden said. Both Boeing and Airbus said they welcomed the truce. Airbus said that the agreement \"will provide the basis to create a level-playing field which we have advocated for since the start of this dispute\". \"It will also avoid lose-lose tariffs that are only adding to the many challenges that our industry faces,\" the planemaker added. The dispute between the US and EU has escalated over many years, with both sides accusing the other of unfairly propping up their flagship planemakers.  In 2019, the World Trade Organization ruled that the EU had illegally provided support to Airbus, clearing the way for the US to respond with tariffs worth up to $7.5bn (\u00a35.4bn) in annual trade. Roughly one year later, in a parallel case, it ruled that the US benefits to Boeing also violated trade rules, authorising the EU to hit the US with tariffs worth roughly $4bn. Since then, both sides have taken steps to remove the assistance found at fault. The US and the EU have taken a much more conciliatory stance in the 17-year dispute since President Biden took over from predecessor Donald Trump, who imposed tariffs on the EU. \"This meeting has started with a breakthrough on aircraft,\" European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said. \"This really opens a new chapter in our relationship because we move from litigation to cooperation on aircraft - after 17 years of dispute... Today we have delivered.\" President Biden had a meeting with EC President von der Leyen and the EU's chairman Charles Michel, who represents EU governments. \"We're facing a once in a century global health crisis,\" President Biden said on Monday, while adding: \"Russia and China are both seeking to drive a wedge in our transatlantic solidarity.\" US Trade Representative Katherine Tai discussed the aircraft dispute in her first face-to-face meeting with EU counterpart Valdis Dombrovskis on Monday ahead of Tuesday's US-EU summit. Freezing the trade conflicts would give both sides more time to focus on broader agendas such as concerns over China's state-driven economic model, diplomats said. \"We are strongest when we work with our friends and allies\", Ms Tai said. \"Our goal was clear - to forge a new, co-operative relationship in this sector so that our companies and our workers can compete on a more level playing field.\" The EU and the US are the world's top trading powers, along with China, but Donald Trump sought to sideline the EU. After scotching a free-trade agreement with the EU, the Trump administration focused on shrinking a growing US deficit in goods trade. President Biden, however, sees the EU as an ally in promoting free trade, as well as in fighting climate change and ending the Covid-19 pandemic. In December, the UK said it would voluntarily suspend its tariffs on US goods imposed as parts of the Boeing dispute. The US responded in kind in March. UK officials said they hoped for compromise talks, casting the measure as an example of the benefits to the UK's ability to act as an independent trading nation following Brexit. The world has changed a great deal since 2004 - and this deal acknowledges that fact. Where once Airbus and Boeing had the large aircraft market to themselves, they now face a stern challenge from China. Chinese manufacturer Comac is already in the final stages of developing the C919 - a plane designed as a direct rival to Airbus' A320 neo and the Boeing 737 Max. Longer term, it has a partnership with Russia's United Aircraft Corporation, to develop a larger, wide-body jet. Airbus's chief executive Guillaume Faury has already suggested that the duopoly in the aircraft market could become a 'triopoly' by the end of the decade.  So it makes little sense for either side to waste energy fighting yesterday's battles when they now face a common rival. It's a microcosm of wider EU-US relations: faced with China's growing economic power and ever-frostier relations with Russia, there seems to be a realisation that old alliances need to be rekindled.",

            "title": "Ryanair returns to profit as fares jump",
            "text": "Budget airline Ryanair has reported its first profit since the pandemic as fares and passenger numbers rebounded. The carrier's profits hit \u20ac1.43bn (\u00a31.24bn) in the year to March, with average fares up by 50% to \u20ac41. However, the airline warned its fuel costs were set to jump in the next year due to high oil prices. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said current fares were \"significantly\" higher than a year ago, when demand was hit by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Aviation expert John Strickland, from JLS Consulting, told the BBC's Today programme that fares could increase even more, with a family of four seeing costs rise by \"another \u00a320 or \u00a330\".  However, he said these rises were unlikely to put people off travelling. \"If you talk about, let's say, a 10% increase or even a 15% or 20% increase, we're only talking about a few pounds, maybe five, six, seven in increased costs,\" he said.  \"While that's not nothing, I don't believe that's going to be a showstopper in terms of demand.\"  Ryanair saw passenger numbers rebound by 74% to 168.6 million last year as the demand for travel continued to recover. The airline, which is due to operate its biggest ever schedule of flights this summer with 3,000 daily flights, is expecting to take delivery of 300 new Boeing aircraft by 2037.  Mr O'Leary said demand to travel this summer is \"robust and peak summer 2023 fares are trending ahead of last year\". Despite the high fuel costs, he said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" that this would be covered by higher revenues, delivering a \"modest year-on-year profit increase\". Last week, rival airline EasyJet reported pre-tax losses of \u00a3411m for the six months to the end of March this year.  But its boss Johan Lundgren said the business was entering the summer \"with confidence\" after it flew more than 33 million customers during that period, up 41% compared with the same time last year. Passengers are also paying more to fly with EasyJet - the average ticket price paid was \u00a361, up 24% on a year earlier. Recent figures from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) suggest airline ticket prices have only just caught up with the average inflation rate in the OECD, and have risen at a lower rate than increases in jet fuel prices.  IATA said this was \"especially challenging for airlines considering that the cost of jet fuel accounts for 25% to 30% of their operating costs\". While oil prices are falling globally, \"fuel hedging\" - where jet fuel is bought at a fixed price for later delivery - is commonplace within the aviation industry. As a result, airlines may be paying higher fuel prices for longer depending on when they fixed their costs.",

            "title": "Lion Air crash: Indonesian search homes in on black box",
            "text": "A signal from the black box of the Lion Air plane which crashed on Monday with 189 people on board has been located, Indonesian rescuers believe. Indonesia's military chief said divers were trying to check the location some 30-40m (100-130ft) down in the Java Sea but had to battle strong currents. Flight JT610, a Boeing 737, went down shortly after take-off from Jakarta. No survivors have been found. Meanwhile Lion Air has sacked its technical director. The company said its dismissal of Muhammad Asif had come on the orders of the transport ministry. Representatives from Boeing are meeting Indonesian officials on Wednesday as part of the investigation. There is no indication so far of what caused the plane to go down 13 minutes after taking off, though a log obtained by the BBC showed the plane had encountered technical problems while flying from Bali to Jakarta the previous day. Search teams have been using an underwater drone, as well as underwater \"pinger locators\", to try to pick up the sonar signals from the flight recorders. On Wednesday, armed forces head Hadi Tjahjanto said rescuers believed a \"ping\" first detected the previous day came from one of the recorders. He said divers had tried to retrieve it and would make fresh attempts shortly. \"I am sure we will find a black box given the strong indication, and, not far from there, the main body of the plane,\" he said, quoted by Reuters news agency. Efforts to find parts of the plane have been hampered by strong currents and the presence of oil and gas pipelines in the vicinity, said search and rescue agency chief Muhammed Syaugi. He added that, if found, the plane's main fuselage would be lifted by crane. A large number of bodies was expected to be trapped inside, he said. Body parts, debris and personal belongings have already been collected from the water, and body bags are being taken to Jakarta for identification.  Flight JT610 was heading for the western city of Pangkal Pinang when it went down. Officials say the pilot of the Boeing 737 had asked to return to Soekarno-Hatta airport shortly before losing contact with air traffic control.  The cause of the crash is not known, although a technical log from the plane's previous flight on Sunday showed one instrument was giving \"unreliable\" airspeed readings and the captain had to hand over to the first officer. Altitude readings also differed on the captain and first officer's instruments. Lion Air chief executive Edward Sirait said on Tuesday that the plane had had technical problems, but had been repaired before being allowed to fly again. Indonesia, a vast archipelago, is heavily reliant on air travel but many of its airlines have a poor safety record. The country has had issues of safety and poor management in the past and its airlines were banned from flying into European airspace until 2016.",

As well as its role following the Queen's death, the plane was part of the mission to evacuate refugees from Afghanistan. Attendees of RIAT - the world's largest military air show - are being warned to prepare for longer delays to get in due to extra security checks. The air show runs until Sunday. The C-17's loadmaster, Peter Hicks, said he is particularly proud of returning the Queen to London after her death. \"We were very humbled to take part in that,\" he said. \"It was a very well managed operation and it is something we are very proud of.\" The C-17, made by Boeing, is a long range, heavy-lift strategic transport aircraft. Tom Collins is the plane's pilot. \"She's a dream to fly,\" he said. \"I would love to teach others to fly on this aircraft.\" Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The world's largest passenger plane will fly between Glasgow and Dubai from April until the end of September next year. For the first two months, the number of daily flights between the two cities will be cut from two to one.  Emirates said the A380 was being introduced to minimise a reduction in capacity as a result of planned runway works at Dubai International Airport. From 16 April until 31 May, the larger capacity A380 will replace Emirates' current twice-daily Boeing 777 service between Glasgow and Dubai. From 1 June until 30 September, the double daily service will be reinstated on the route, with the Airbus A380 operating on the first flight of the day, and a Boeing 777 on the second. Thereafter, the service will revert back to a twice-daily Boeing 777 operation. A380 facts and figures: Stands at more than 24m (79ft) high The aircraft has wing span of nearly 80m (262ft) The A380 has two decks As flown by Emirates, it has 14 private suites in first class, 76 fully flat-bed seats in business class and 399 seats in economy class The new service marks a return to Glasgow for the A380. In 2014, it made a one-off flight from Glasgow as Emirates marked 10 years of operations from the city.  Glasgow Airport managing director Mark Johnston said: \"The decision by Emirates to introduce the A380 is not only a huge milestone for Glasgow Airport, it marks what is a first in the Scottish aviation industry. \"We have forged a valued relationship with Emirates since its inaugural flight in April 2004 and the introduction of Scotland's first-ever scheduled A380 service represents a major vote of confidence in the city.   \"We are currently investing in excess of \u00a38m in our infrastructure to ensure Glasgow Airport is ready to welcome this iconic aircraft when it touches down next April.\"",

            "text": "A Southwest Airlines flight attendant has filed a lawsuit accusing two pilots of livestreaming a plane's toilet on hidden camera. Renee Steinaker alleges she caught the pilots during a 2017 flight from Pittsburgh to Phoenix. Captain Terry Graham asked her to sit in the cockpit with co-pilot, Ryan Russell, while he used the toilet, the suit alleges.  Ms Steinaker alleges she saw an iPad showing live video from the toilet. The pilots and Southwest Airlines have denied there was a camera filming passengers and crew members in the toilet. The airline said the incident was \"an inappropriate attempt at humour\". Ms Steinaker alleges that Mr Russell told her to keep quiet about the camera, which he said was a \"top-secret security measure\". The flight attendant reported the incident to the airline, but alleges that a supervisor ordered her not to talk to anybody about what happened. The pilots were not sanctioned by Southwest Airlines and continue to pilot commercial flights for the airline, according to the suit. \"The allegations [in this lawsuit] frame conduct that is outrageous,\" Ronald Goldman, a lawyer representing Ms Steinaker, told the BBC. In a statement, Southwest Airlines told the BBC that the airline \"does not place cameras in the lavatories of our aircraft\". Initially, the American airline declined to comment further on the lawsuit. But in a later statement, the airline said it had investigated the allegations and found there was never a camera in the toilet. \"Southwest will vigorously defend the lawsuit,\" the airline said. \"When the incident happened two years ago, we investigated the allegations and addressed the situation with the crew involved. \"We can confirm from our investigation that there was never a camera in the lavatory; the incident was an inappropriate attempt at humour which the company did not condone.\" The BBC has requested comment from the lawyer representing the pilots. In their written response to the complaint, Mr Russell and Mr Graham admitted an iPad was in the cockpit, but denied all other allegations, CNN reported. Around two hours into the flight, on 27 February, 2017, Mr Graham asked Ms Steinaker to sit in the cockpit while he went to the toilet, the suit alleges. According to Southwest Airlines policy, at least two staff members are required to be in the cockpit at all times. Mr Russell admitted the camera was livestreaming \"with a panicked look on his face\" before advising Ms Steinaker not to tell anyone about \"this new security measure\", the suit alleges. The cameras were a \"top-secret security measure\" installed in all the airline's 737-800 planes, Mr Russell allegedly told the flight attendant. Sceptical of Mr Russell's explanation, Ms Steinaker took a photograph of the iPad with her phone, the suit states.  When Ms Steinaker complained, a supervisor allegedly told her to keep quiet about it because \"if this got out, if this went public, no one, I mean no one, would ever fly our airline again\". Ms Steinaker's lawsuit seeks at least $50,000 (\u00a338,000) in damages from Southwest Airlines and the pilots. Mr Goldman said his client had been \"significantly harmed\" by the alleged conduct, which caused her \"severe emotional distress\". The lawsuit was initially filed in Maricopa County, Arizona, but has been moved to US District Court in Arizona. No trial date has been set.",

            "title": "Boeing: US regulator admits 'mistake' over aircraft crashes",
            "text": "US aviation regulators allowed Boeing's 737 Max aircraft to continue flying despite knowing there was a risk of further crashes. Analysis after the first crash last year predicted there could be up to 15 disasters over the lifetime of the aircraft without design changes. Despite this, the Federal Aviation Administration did not ground the Max until a second crash five months later. FAA chief Steve Dickson, who started in August, said this was a mistake. The FAA risk assessment was revealed during a US congressional hearing on Wednesday. Lawmakers are investigating Boeing following fatal 737 Max crashes in Indonesia in October 2018, and Ethiopia in March. The disasters killed 346 people in total. Air safety officials investigating the crashes have identified an automated control system in the 737 Max 8, known as MCAS, as a factor in both accidents.  Boeing has said the system, which relied on a single sensor, received erroneous data, which led it to override pilot commands and push the aircraft downwards.  The FAA's investigation of the October Indonesia crash called for Boeing to redesign its system, warning of a risk of more than a dozen crashes over the 45-year lifetime of the roughly 4,800 737 Max planes in service. Regulators also issued an alert to airlines, but the agency did not ground the aircraft until after the 10 March Ethiopia crash, several days after action by other countries. \"Was a mistake made?\" asked Democrat congressman Henry Johnson. \"Obviously the result was not satisfactory,\" said Mr Dickson. In response to later questions, he admitted the agency had made a mistake at some point in the process.  Boeing is revising the MCAS software, but lawmakers say their investigation has shown that the aircraft manufacturer was aware of flaws in the system. Boeing staff have also raised concerns that the company was prioritising speed over safety at the factory that produced Max 737s, contributing to the crashes. Ed Pierson, a former senior manager at the factory, told Congress he repeatedly warned Boeing's leadership of the safety risks caused by what he described as a \"factory in chaos\", but it had little effect. He also said that, after the crashes, US government regulators have shown little interest in his concerns. \"I remain gravely concerned that... the flying public will remain at risk unless this unstable production environment is rigorously investigated and closely monitored by regulators on an ongoing basis,\" he said in prepared testimony. Mr Dickson said the FAA is probing production issues. He also said he is considering further actions against Boeing. In a statement, Boeing said Mr Pierson's own account showed the company took his concerns seriously. \"Company executives and senior leaders on the 737 programme were made aware of Mr Pierson's concerns, discussed them in detail, and took appropriate steps to assess them,\" it said.

            "title": "Welsh Government-Qatar Airways deal cost 'confidential'",
            "text": "The amount of taxpayer cash spent on a global deal with Qatar Airways to market Wales is being kept secret by the Welsh government.  It said the deal's significance \"cannot be underestimated\", but the value and structure was commercially sensitive. Releasing it would be likely to create an \"expectation\" other companies would be entitled to a similar deal, it said. Tory Assembly leader Andrew RT Davies said ministers seemed to be \"hiding behind commercial confidentiality\". Direct flights began between the Welsh government-owned Cardiff Airport and Doha in Qatar in May. First Minister Carwyn Jones called it a \"huge boost\" for Wales which would open up links to the rest of the world. The two-year marketing partnership between the Welsh government and Qatar Airways, which was revealed in March, will see \"extensive activity in key markets to raise the awareness of routes into Cardiff Airport\". The Welsh government and Qatar Airways will monitor and audit the deal's value for money.  Under the Freedom of Information Act, BBC Wales asked the Welsh government to provide the cost and structure of the partnership to market Wales internationally as a business and tourist destination. It refused to release the information on the \"unique\" deal on the basis it could prejudice the economy of Wales, and compromise the commercial interests of Qatar Airways.   \"The release of this information... would place into the public domain highly sensitive and current commercial information which is still being relied upon by the Welsh government in negotiating similar deals with other companies,\" it said. \"The economy of Wales is interlinked with the success of this deal and its significance and subsequent success cannot be underestimated in this regard.\" The Welsh government accepted the information might become less commercially sensitive over time. Dr Lucy Budd, an air transport management expert at Loughborough University, said a marketing deal of this nature was not unusual. \"There are many examples of urban, regional and national tourist boards partnering airports to support new routes and promote the attributes and attractions of the destination in question,\" she said. She said a similar deal was set up on an EasyJet route between London Gatwick and Gothenburg. Mr Davies said everyone wanted Qatar Airlines to be a success, but \"the gap between rhetoric and reality where the Welsh government is concerned usually ends up with the taxpayer footing a significant bill\". Plaid Cymru AM Rhun ap Iorwerth said the commercial sensitivity argument did not stack up, adding: \"We need to be sure that Wales is getting a good deal here, too.\" UKIP's Welsh assembly leader Caroline Jones said, following \"the Pinewood debacle\", the public and the assembly should be allowed to scrutinise the deal.  \"Are the Welsh taxpayer paying through the nose to enhance Qatar Airways' profits? Without transparency we won't know until it's too late,\" she added. A spokeswoman said the Welsh government strived \"to be as open and transparent as possible\". \"However, we have a duty to the companies we work with to protect the confidential nature of any business agreements,\" she said.   The marketing partnership had been widely welcomed as increasing Wales' profile, she added. \"Commercial partnerships are an important part of Visit Wales' marketing work which generated an additional value of \u00a3356m to the Welsh economy in 2017.\"",

            "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed Western outrage over the diversion of a Ryanair jet to the Belarus capital from where a dissident and his girlfriend were seized. During talks in the Russian resort city of Sochi, Mr Putin and his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko spoke of \"an outpouring of emotion\". The EU has since urged Europe-based airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace. They have demanded the release of Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega. The pair had been flying from Athens to Vilnius, two EU capitals, last Sunday, when a fighter jet was scrambled over Belarus to escort their plane to land at Minsk airport over a bomb threat which turned out to be fake. The UN's civil aviation agency has said it will launch a \"fact-finding\" investigation into Belarus's actions, asking whether there was any breach of international aviation law.   After the EU called on airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace, Russia refused access for several Moscow-bound Air France and Austrian Airlines flights. In another development, the EU revealed a draft plan to fund a future \"democratic transition\" in Belarus with up to \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.6bn; $3.7bn).   EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell stressed that the current Belarusian president was unlikely to benefit, telling reporters in Lisbon: \"It means something that I don't think Lukashenko... will be supporting.\" Russia is the Belarusian leader's strongest political ally, even though personal relations between the two long-time presidents are at times said to be strained. Mr Putin suggested that the EU had applied double standards - and referred to an incident in 2013 when a plane carrying Bolivian President Evo Morales from Moscow was denied entry to several surrounding countries as the US hunted for fugitive whistleblower Edward Snowden, who had sought sanctuary in Russia. Mr Putin said that in 2013 \"there was silence\" from the EU as the Bolivian plane was forced to divert to Vienna airport. The Belarusian president told Mr Putin that the West was seeking to stir new unrest in his country.  \"An attempt is under way to rock the boat to reach the level of last August,\" he said, referring to mass protests against his rule after a disputed election. Mr Putin praised closer ties between Russia and Belarus, which are formally two parts of a Union State. Where is Belarus? It has its ally Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Why does it matter? Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko has been nicknamed \"Europe's last dictator\" - he has been in power for 27 years. What's going on there? There is a huge opposition movement demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. The opposition movement and Western governments say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election. Officially he won by a landslide. A huge police crackdown has curbed street protests and sent opposition leaders to prison or into exile. On Sunday, Ryanair Flight 4978 was travelling from Athens to Vilnius, when it was forcibly diverted to Minsk.  Belarusian authorities said they had received a bomb threat - via Switzerland - but according to Swiss secure email provider Proton Mail the emailed message was sent after the plane was diverted. Aboard were Mr Protasevich, 26, and his girlfriend, Ms Sapega, 23, an international law student and Russian national. They were arrested as passengers disembarked the plane. Mr Protasevich is a former editor of Nexta, a dissident media operation with a popular Telegram messenger channel. He left Belarus in 2019 and now lives in exile in Lithuania. Nexta became a significant channel for protesters challenging the August 2020 presidential election in Belarus, widely condemned as rigged. Mr Protasevich, who was put on the Belarusian terrorist list last year, is accused of orchestrating the mass unrest last year and could be jailed for up to 15 years. Russia's foreign ministry says Ms Sapega is accused of breaking Belarusian law last August and September. Videos were released showing the pair confessing to crimes, but it is likely they were speaking under duress. Their arrests and the forced landing of the plane have prompted international outrage. \"We must have measures to ensure that can't happen again,\" the head of the International Air Transport Association, Willie Walsh, told Reuters news agency.",

            "title": "Lion Air crash: Boeing sued by victim's family over aircraft design",
            "text": "The family of a passenger killed when a Lion Air flight crashed into the sea near Indonesia are suing Boeing over an alleged fault with the jet's design. The lawsuit accuses the US aircraft manufacturer of failing to inform pilots and airlines of a feature with its new 737 Max plane system that could \"push the nose down unexpectedly\".  Investigators have been looking into reported technical issues. Boeing maintains that it is \"confident in the safety of the 737 Max\". Lion Air flight JT 610 was carrying 189 people when it crashed on 29 October.  It plummeted into the Java Sea following a request from the pilot for permission to turn back to the airport just moments after taking off from Jakarta. It was later established that the aircraft had had an airspeed indicator problem on its final four flights. On Thursday, a complaint was filed by a Florida-based law firm on behalf of the parents of Rio Nanda Pratama, who was on board the ill-fated flight JT 610.  The lawsuit focuses on the 737 Max's new automated flight control system, which it says was designed to help prevent pilots from raising the aircraft's nose \"dangerously high\". However, the lawsuit adds: \"Under certain conditions [the system] can push the nose down unexpectedly and so strongly that the pilot cannot pull it back up in time to avoid a crash. \"This automated feature can be triggered even if pilots are manually flying the aircraft and don't expect flight-control computers to kick in. \"It is particularly surprising to hear from safety experts and the heads of pilots' unions that Boeing failed to warn its customers and the pilots of its new 737 Max aircraft about this significant change in the flight-control systems.\" Boeing, meanwhile, has said that it is not able to \"discuss specifics of an ongoing investigation\". Mr Pratama was a passenger on flight JT 610 travelling home to marry his fianc\u00e9e, Intan Syari.  Ms Syari, who said she wanted to fulfil his last wish, appeared alone wearing her white gown and wedding ring in photos posted to her Instagram account earlier this week. There is as yet no indication of what caused the crash but the plane had experienced technical problems related to airspeed and altitude readings. Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee said an \"angle-of-attack\" sensor had been changed the day before the crash. One of the black box recorders from the flight has been retrieved but authorities say it could take months to analyse the data from it. The plane was making a one-hour journey to the western city of Pangkal Pinang when it went down. No survivors were found.",

            "title": "UK to drop US goods tariffs in bid for trade deal",
            "text": "The UK will drop tariffs against the US over subsidies for aerospace firms, in a bid to reach a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. In November, the EU hit $4bn of US goods with duties of up to 25% in retaliation for illegal state aid given to planemaker Boeing. They will be suspended in the UK from 1 January - when the current post-Brexit transition period ends. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the UK wanted to find compromise. \"As an independent trading nation once again, we finally have the ability to shape these tariffs,\" she said.  \"Ultimately, we want to de-escalate the conflict and come to a negotiated settlement so we can deepen our trading relationship with the US and draw a line under all this,\" she added. The fight over aircraft subsidies to Boeing and European rival Airbus pre-dates outgoing US President Donald Trump's time in office, but trade tensions between the two allies have become strained recently. Donald Trump's administration hit the European Union (EU) with tariffs on $7.5bn worth of goods in retaliation for state support given to Airbus. Products such as Scotch whisky were affected by the ongoing row.  However, the ADS Group, which represents the UK aerospace industry, said on Wednesday that it was \"disappointed\" the UK made the decision without \"securing some reciprocal action to resolve this dispute\". Airbus, which has a huge UK factory making aircraft wings, said that it still aims to \"find a negotiated settlement of this long-standing dispute to avoid lose-lose tariffs\". The industry is being polite officially, expressing \"surprise\" and \"disappointment\", but is privately furious at what one top industry official said was a \"capitulation\" over the Airbus-Boeing dispute. In January, Andrea Leadsom, then Business Secretary, told an Airbus audience the UK would continue to support EU efforts to negotiate a settlement over the dispute.  So why the change, and why now? The only plausible explanation is the government hopes to get a very late \"mini deal\" out of the departing Trump administration, and perhaps boost the slim odds of a Biden deal before his Congressional authority to do so expires in 2021. There is a political carrot in the possible removal of US Scotch whisky tariffs, which could be used as electoral capital in Holyrood elections. But there are no guarantees. And, Team Biden shows no interest in doing trade deals with any nation quickly. The UK employs tens of thousands in the Airbus supply chain, and the company is already having to deal with the impact of new frictions and barriers in trade with the EU. But now its arch competitor, Boeing, will be able to sell its planes 15% cheaper to the UK. Trade Secretary Liz Truss clearly believes this sort of unilateral move will help \"jump start\" talks with the US. But Airbus is also a symbol of the pan-European co-operation that the UK wants to protect. Allowing the US to split the European position on this while make-or-break Brexit trade talks continue, will not go unnoticed in Brussels. Scotch Whisky Association chief executive Karen Betts described the announcement on Tuesday as \"an encouraging step\". \"It shows the UK government's determination to de-escalate the damaging transatlantic trade disputes that have seen Scotch whisky exports to the US fall by over 30% in the past year,\" she said. \"We now call on the US government to reciprocate by suspending the tariffs on UK goods stemming from the Airbus-Boeing dispute, so that industries in the UK and the US affected by this dispute can once again trade freely.\" Downing Street views a trade deal with the US as one of the major prizes on offer as a result of the UK's exit from the EU. But while the Trump administration said the UK would be \"first in line\" for a deal once it quit the bloc, President-elect Joe Biden has been cooler on the idea.  Earlier this year, he said any deal had to be \"contingent\" on respect for the Good Friday Agreement governing the Irish border.  And last week he said he would not enter any new trade agreement with a foreign power until the US has made \"major investments here at home and in our workers and in education\". On Tuesday the UK said it would maintain tariffs imposed by the EU after President Trump put duties on foreign steel and aluminium in 2018. \"We are protecting our steel industry against illegal and unfair tariffs - and will continue to do so - but are also showing the US we are serious about ending a dispute that benefits neither country,\" Ms Truss said. The EU said in November that it still hoped to settle the fight, and one trade official has said that President-elect Joe Biden's win might help \"reboot\" talks. Analysts have previously suggested that Mr Biden will, at least, shy away from escalating the tariffs and might remove existing ones - as well as those applied to imports of steel and aluminium.",

            "title": "Boeing: French investigators find crash 'similarities'",
            "text": "Investigators examining black box recordings from the doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight have found \"clear similarities\" with a previous crash. Last week's crash of a Boeing 737 Max was the second disaster involving the aircraft type in five months. The French BEA accident authority did not detail the similarities, but media reports suggested they found similar flight angles before the crashes. It comes amid continuing questions over 737 Max's design and vetting to fly. Regulators across the world have grounded the aircraft until further notice. In a short statement on Monday, the Paris-based BEA, whose experts have been asked by Ethiopian Airlines to examine the black boxes, said: \"During the verification process of the FDR (flight data recorder) data, clear similarities were noted by the investigation team between Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Lion Air Flight 610, which will be the subject of further study during the investigation.\" Both the Ethiopian Airlines flight eight days ago and a Lion Air aircraft in October crashed within minutes of take-off.  In the case of the Lion Air flight, pilots had difficulties with a new system on the Boeing 737 Max which is designed to keep the plane from stalling. It prevents a jet from pointing upwards at too high an angle, where it could lose its lift. But an investigation of the Lion Air flight showed the automatic anti-stalling system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down more than 20 times. Ethiopia's Transport Ministry and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have both pointed to similarities between the two disasters. US regulators and safety experts are now asking how thoroughly the FAA and Boeing vetted the anti-stall system and how well pilots around the world were trained for it when their airlines bought new planes. Over the weekend, a report in The Seattle Times claimed that some analysis before the crash found that the system, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, revealed crucial flaws. It claims that managers at the FAA instructed its safety engineers to delegate safety assessments to Boeing and to approve the resulting analysis. The report alleges that the analysis produced by Boeing understated the power of the control system and that it could reset itself every time the pilot responded. This meant that the system could repeatedly push the nose of the plane down. The FAA said its \"aircraft certification processes are well established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs.\" \"The 737-MAX certification program followed the FAA's standard certification process,\" it added. Boeing has been contacted for comment. The world's biggest planemaker says the 737 Max is safe, but after the Lion Air crash last year it began plans to roll out a new software upgrade. Both Ethiopia's transport minister and, now, France's air accident investigation bureau, the BEA, have said there similarities between two Boeing 737 Max crashes. So where did this information come from?  Well, last week, the BEA was given the job of downloading data from the plane's black boxes - the flight data recorder (FDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR).  This it was able to do relatively quickly. The sound files from the voice recorder - which monitors pilots' conversations and other noises within the cockpit - were sent directly to Addis Ababa, without being listened to. However, when it came to the FDR, the agency needed to make sure that the mass of data it was downloading was readable and not corrupted. It therefore brought a few basic parameters up on screen to verify them. We don't know exactly what those parameters were, but they were enough to reinforce the theory that the two aircraft suffered similar problems during flight. The Ethiopian transport ministry obviously now has all of this information - but it also has evidence gathered at the scene of the crash and satellite tracking data. The next step is to carry out a proper analysis of the contents of both flight recorders. It is impossible to say how long that will take. Nor is it clear who will carry out the analysis. Ethiopia could ask the BEA, use its own experts, or request help from another agency altogether. However, the authorities there have promised a preliminary report within 30 days.  That could give a reasonable indication of what happened. It may help to show whether the aircraft was brought down by technical failures, design flaws, pilot error or a combination of all three. But the question of why it happened and who was ultimately at fault may take much longer to answer. The full investigation could take years. ",

            "text": "If you want to get this briefing by email, sign up here You know it's a day of high drama in Westminster when even BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says she's never seen anything like it. On Wednesday, Conservative MPs, including cabinet ministers, defied orders and ensured a vote to reject a no-deal Brexit under any circumstances passed. It was certainly humiliating for Theresa May, and afterwards Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Parliament must now take control of the process. But Mrs May was having none of it. To a barrage of noise, with her voice failing, the prime minister said no-deal remained the default in law unless something else was agreed. This is undoubtedly a crisis, says Laura Kuenssberg, but one that presents an opportunity for the PM. On Thursday, MPs will be asked if they want to delay Brexit until 30 June, but only if they back Mrs May's deal by 20 March in a third meaningful vote. If they fail to do that, Mrs May said the delay could be much longer, requiring the UK to take part in European Parliament elections in May. It's a gamble, but the PM hopes that by presenting Brexiteers with the choice, \"back me or see your Brexit kicked into the long grass\", enough will fall into line. However, as BBC Europe editor Katya Adler told Brexitcast, the complicating factor may be that the EU really doesn't want to grant a long delay. A side note. Those ministers who defied the whip won't be sacked - that breaks one of Parliament's unwritten rules and has left many wondering how any party can govern with such little discipline. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning Boeing has grounded its entire fleet of 737 Max aircraft. The move came after a team of investigators from the US Federal Aviation Authority said they had uncovered evidence that the plane involved in Sunday's fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash had \"behaved very similarly\" to a Lion Air one that crashed in October. The FAA had previously insisted the aircraft was airworthy, despite a string of other countries banning it from their airspace - afraid that the second crash in five months was a sign of a systemic problem. Boeing's decision affects the 371 aircraft currently in operation, but thousands more are on order - their future now uncertain. Facebook has suffered the most severe outage in its history, leaving key services unusable around the world. Its main product, two messaging apps and Instagram were all affected.

The Sun talks of Tory MPs breaking down in tears in the voting lobbies. The Guardian's John Crace says Westminster descended into near anarchy. In the midst of this, the Daily Telegraph thinks Chancellor Phillip Hammond used his spring statement to signal he no longer backs the PM's withdrawal deal, and instead wants a compromise with Labour. The Financial Times praises that position, saying Mrs May and cabinet Brexiteers must break out of their tunnel vision, that it's the PM's deal or nothing.

One sector that has been deeply impacted by the pandemic is the flower industry in East and Southern Africa, which is one of the biggest exporters of cut flowers in the world. Prior to the pandemic, the global cut flower market was worth $13bn (\u00a310.4bn) per annum, according to international flower trade association Union Fleurs.  The European Union and the US are the biggest buyers of cut flowers in the world, Union Fleurs says. Kenya is Africa's largest flower exporter, with South Africa not far behind. Multiflora in Johannesburg is one of South Africa's busiest cut flower auction houses. Prior to the pandemic, the auction house had an annual turnover of $16m. But right now, the auction house is getting 40% of the revenue it previously had.  Delayed and cancelled flights, increased freight costs and a huge fall in demand have brought the flower trade to a virtual standstill, and some flower farms in Kenya have already gone out of business since lockdown began.   All in all, the flower industry in Africa estimates that it has so far had to throw away 241,000 stems as a result of the pandemic.  \"If there's no socialising, there's no need for flowers. We're effectively looking at two months of non-trading,\" Ian Ross, managing director of Flora Export SA tells the BBC. However, many more businesses across the African continent have a focus on importing rather than exporting, flying in goods from China and India and reselling them at a higher price. Latest data from British property consultancy and estate agency Knight Frank shows that transport costs represent between 50-75% of the retail price of goods sold in Africa.  \"People want to get rich quickly, so the fastest way is to import goods and charge a high markup - many successful people have done this,\" explains Alex Demissie, managing director of Africa Rising, a business consultancy based in Cologne that advises international companies on entering African markets. \"They do have pride for their countries [and homegrown products], but if there's a lot of hassle, people will always use the easiest way to make money.\" The pandemic has unfortunately disrupted this business model, and it has opened the eyes of African entrepreneurs to the reality that local manufacturing needs to become a priority.  \"Supply chains have become longer and more complicated, and hence more vulnerable,\" says Andrew Alli, chief executive of Southbridge, a pan-African consulting advisory and financial services firm. For example, rubber might be produced in Africa, but it is then exported to China to make personal protective equipment (PPE) like masks, which are then shipped to Europe, he explains, rather than African firms just making the masks themselves for sale.  But this is changing now - Africa Rising has seen a new trend of businesses trying to import more machines into African nations to set up local production centres, instead of importing finished products. \"This is a very positive development for small and mid-sized companies - international firms who are investing in African countries are actively looking for local components that they can use in their factories on site,\" says Mr Demissie. \"We see a trend of diasporas returning to their countries to produce goods for these big international companies, such as making zippers for clothing firms. \"Supply chains are moving closer to these factories. At the end of the day, this is what will be creating jobs and making things more successful in the future.\" The other reason African entrepreneurs have historically depended on imports from China and India is that even if you can find someone to make the goods you want to sell in the region, current cross-border supply chains still leave much to be desired. It is too expensive to import goods from neighbouring nations, says Mr Demissie, so smaller firms simply don't bother. South Africa, Morocco and Egypt have sophisticated supply chains similar to those of developed countries, but the rest of the continent is still trailing far behind, due to weak infrastructure. \"It takes too long at customs to bring in the goods. Some of these nations are facing similar obstacles to Southeast Asian countries and China at the beginning of the 1980s,\" says Mr Demissie. But efforts are being made gradually to improve transport networks in some nations. Investments made by Chinese firms in Ethiopia and Kenya over the last three years have greatly improved rail connectivity, making it much easier to import and export goods, and the establishment of special economic zones in Ethiopia, Ghana and Nigeria are helping these countries to start local production centres.  Mr Demissie says that coronavirus lockdown has \"accelerated\" a change in mindset amongst African entrepreneurs, and firms are already coming up with unique \"indigenous\" ways to solve Africa's supply chain problems, like Ethiopian Airlines or Kenya Airways. Ethiopian Airlines is currently Africa's largest air passenger carrier. Started in 1945, the state-owned airline flies to 100 international destinations, as well as 21 domestic routes across the continent, and it also has an air freight service.  Ethiopian Airlines boss Tewolde GebreMariam told the BBC recently that he does not expect the government to bail the airline out, and to that end the airline has decided to focus on providing even more freight cargo deliveries, both internationally and across the continent, delivering everything from fresh produce to medications and PPE. \"It is a very tough challenge but we think we can survive with our cargo business,\" he says. Kenya Airways is also now considering wide-bodied passenger carriers to bolster its cargo shipments, converting four of its wide-bodied aircrafts into cargo freight aeroplanes. On the day the BBC visited, Kenya Airways ground staff were loading 40 tonnes of fresh-cut flowers and fruits and vegetables into a Boeing 787 Dreamliner destined for London, with the cargo placed on top of seats. Nigerian motorcycle transit app-based platform startup Max, which already operates in 10 West African cities, is a solution unique to the continent that has also ended up benefiting from the coronavirus lockdown. \"One of the outcomes of the pandemic is that with people stuck at home and not able to move around, they've had to find ways to get their essentials delivered to their doorsteps, which has been beneficial to us and has driven the growth of our logistics and last-mile delivery services,\" says Max Nigeria's chief financial officer Betrand Njoya. \"We expect that we'll be in a position to grow the size of our network to more than 5,000 drivers within the next 12-18 months.\" Supply chains in many African nations are still not very good, and the African Development Bank (ADB) estimates that the continent would need $90-$130bn of investment in infrastructure per annum in order to get the region to where it needs to be.  That is a tough figure to get to, but Mr Demissie says that Chinese, Indian, South Korean, Singaporean, Iranian and Russian companies are now pouring some money into improving infrastructure across the continent. \"Africa still has the youngest population of any continent - who is going to make and sell consumer goods for the African consumers coming up?,\" he tells the BBC. \"China was very backwards at the end of the 1970s, but people were willing to go and invest because they could see the opportunity, and we're seeing that in African nations now.\" You can tune into In Business Africa every Friday at 18:30 GMT on BBC World News.",

            "title": "Paris Airshow: Boeing and Airbus under pressure",
            "text": "The Paris airport of Le Bourget was once a pretty glamorous place. It was here that aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh landed after his solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927, and it was a gateway to the French capital for Hollywood legends such as Audrey Hepburn for many years.  Those days are long gone.  Surrounded by drab suburbs and urban motorways it now caters mainly for private jets, whose passengers spend as little time as possible amid its rather bleak and windswept surroundings - although it does have a rather good aviation museum. But for the next week Le Bourget will become the beating heart of the global aerospace industry. Scores of politicians - including newly elected President Macron - generals and chief executives will be among the hundreds of thousands of visitors, braving horrendous traffic and negotiating tight security to attend the 52nd Paris Air Show. So what will be the main talking points in the plush chalets and teeming exhibition halls this year? Traditionally, the headlines are dominated by big order announcements from home favourite Airbus and the US aerospace giant Boeing, but the market is far less frothy than it used to be.  Global aircraft orders have declined by about half since their peak in 2014. Low oil prices mean that airlines are under less pressure to replace old aircraft with newer, more efficient models. So we may see fewer announcements.  That isn't a huge problem in itself - both manufacturers already have bulging order books, and both have struggled with supply chain problems, causing delays on the production line. So a reduction in demand may be no bad thing. However that doesn't apply across the board. The giant A380 superjumbo is the flagship of the Airbus fleet - and its appearance is usually a highlight of the air display.  But it isn't selling well and last year the company halved its annual production.  It would doubtless love to announce further orders in Paris but that seems very unlikely. In fact, some are questioning whether the aircraft has a future at all. In the circumstances, Airbus could well find itself upstaged by its American rival. Boeing is expected to set out details of a planned new mid-sized aircraft, a super-efficient model which will sit between the largest 737 and the smallest 787 in its range.  Meanwhile the latest in a series of heavily upgraded 737 models - the Max 10 - is likely to be formally launched at the show.  Yet the two established giants could be forgiven for looking nervously over their shoulders.  China's Comac and Russia's Irkut have both begun testing new airliners over the past few weeks. Neither the C-919 nor the MC-21 will be at the show - but they will certainly be talked about. The market for smaller jets is about to become a lot more crowded. While most of the actual business at Le Bourget is done in the chalets and exhibition halls, the flying display allows companies to show off their latest multi-billion dollar technology.  Among the highlights this year will be the F-35 Lightning II, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter.  It is the product of the world's most expensive defence programme, an international effort led by the US contractor Lockheed Martin - and one which has been beset by delays and cost overruns. It badly needs some good PR, so it can be expected to put on a spectacular show.  Elsewhere, much of the talk will focus on new technology.  Outwardly, aircraft may have changed little over the past few decades. But the way in which they are designed, built, maintained and operated has been transformed. That trend is likely to accelerate. Many of the exhibitors will be showing how virtual reality, augmented reality and 3D printing are already having a major impact on different parts of the industry - and suggesting how their potential could be exploited even further. For some the future lies in Big Data; analysing huge reams of information to detect patterns, create models and to predict future performance. \"The amount of data this industry generates is massive and growing,\" says John Schmidt, managing director of Accenture's aerospace and defence business. \"A single flight by a Boeing 787 generates enough data to fill about 200 DVDs\", he says. \"But very little of that data is actually used.\" Big data, he thinks, can transform the way aerospace companies operate.  The organisers of the show, Gifas, are also keen to show off their futuristic credentials. For that reason, they have set up an \"Air Lab\" dedicated to new technology and ideas, from both established companies and start-ups.  With a rather nice touch, they've put it inside Le Bourget's Concorde Hall - an area dominated by two models of the supersonic airliner that was once ahead of its time, is now obsolete, but still manages to look outrageously futuristic.",

            "title": "Boeing's 737 Max aircraft under scrutiny again",
            "text": "Little more than six months after Boeing's 737 Max was cleared to fly again by US regulators, the aircraft finds itself under intense scrutiny once again. The discovery of a potential electrical problem last month led to the renewed grounding of more than 100 aeroplanes, belonging to 24 airlines around the world.  Deliveries of many more new aircraft have been suspended. Boeing and the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration say they are working closely to address the issue. But the affair has given new energy to critics who claim the 737 Max was allowed back into service prematurely - and that issues which could have contributed to two fatal crashes have not been fully analysed or addressed. Those critics include a high profile whistle-blower, Ed Pierson, who has already sought to link allegedly poor production standards at the 737 factory with electrical defects on the crashed planes, which he claims may have been implicated in both accidents.  According to Boeing and the FAA, the problem first became apparent during testing of a newly manufactured 737 Max 8, which had yet to be delivered to its owner. It was found that electrical power systems on the aircraft were not working correctly. The fault was traced to poor electrical bonding, where panel assemblies that were also intended to conduct electricity and form part of a connection with the frame of the aircraft were not doing so effectively.  This meant that some components on the plane, including the pilots' main instrument panel and a standby power control unit, were improperly grounded, or earthed.  According to the FAA, this could potentially \"affect the operation of certain systems, including engine ice protection, and result in loss of critical functions and/or multiple simultaneous flight deck effects, which may prevent continued safe flight and landing\". The flaw, then, was a dangerous one. The FAA was worried that over time other aircraft, which were already in service, could develop the same condition. It issued an Airworthiness Directive on 30 April stipulating that affected aircraft should be modified before being permitted to fly again.  On the face of it, there is nothing to link these flaws with the errant flight control software - known as MCAS - that triggered the loss of two planes, in Indonesia and Ethiopia, claiming the lives of 346 people. In each of those accidents, flawed data from a faulty sensor prompted MCAS to force the nose of the aircraft down repeatedly, when the pilots were trying to gain height, ultimately pushing it into a catastrophic dive.  According to Chris Brady, a pilot who runs a website and a video channel devoted to technical aspects of the 737, \"the problem is unrelated to MCAS or any other previous Max problem\". It occurred, he says, because in early 2019, Boeing changed the way panels were attached on parts of the plane. It was seen as a very minor change, so it was not notified to regulators. \"There was nothing, let's say, unethical about that\", he explains. \"Prima facie, this appears to be an honest mistake, the implications of which have just been unearthed\". But for Mr Pierson, a former senior manager on the 737 production line, the new electrical issues are a symptom of something more serious. During congressional hearings into the crashes involving the Max, he claimed that in 2018 the factory in Renton, near Seattle had become \"dysfunctional\" and \"chaotic\", as pressure increased to produce new aircraft as quickly as possible. Earlier this year, he published a report that explicitly linked alleged production pressures with electrical anomalies and flight control system problems that occurred on both crashed aircraft prior to the accidents.  He suggested that defects in the wiring of both aircraft could have contributed to the erroneous deployment of the MCAS software, alongside sensor failures already implicated in the crashes. He now says the disclosure of new problems reinforces his case.  \"Yes, MCAS caused the airplanes to pitch down and crash\", he explains.  \"But it was an electrical system malfunction that likely caused the angle of attack sensor to send faulty data to MCAS\". Mr Pierson believes that the 20-month recertification process which cleared the 737 Max to fly again focused on software design and pilot training, but failed to address the impact of production standards at the factory. As a result, he says, it is \"no surprise that new discoveries linked to 737 Max production defects continue to come to light\" on an aircraft described by the FAA's Administrator Steve Dickson as \"the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history\". Mr Pierson says he has written to the US Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg, requesting a meeting to outline his concerns, but has not heard back. Boeing emphatically denies any connection between production standards in the 737 factory and the two accidents involving the 737 Max.  It says: \"The Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines accidents have been reviewed by numerous governmental and regulatory entities, and none of those reviews has found that production conditions in the factory contributed to the accidents.\"  Dai Whittingham is chief executive of the UK Flight Safety Committee, a group of organisations, including airlines and regulators, which promotes safety in commercial aviation. He says that a direct link between the two accidents and the recently-discovered electrical flaws is \"a hard connection to make\".  But on one key point he appears to agree with Mr Pierson. \"These issues are separate in how they've arisen\", he explains, \"but they may well have stemmed from the same corporate culture, with a focus on saving time and keeping costs down over maintaining quality\". The allegation that Boeing prioritised profit over safety in the run up to the two accidents is not new - and indeed was made by prosecutors when announcing a $2.5bn settlement with the aerospace giant earlier this year.  The company says it has learned many lessons as a result of the Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 and Lion Air 610 accidents. It says it has \"made fundamental changes\" and continues \"to look for ways to improve\". \"Boeing is committed to restore trust, and we'll do it one airplane at a time,\" it said.  People within the company insist the changes which led to the current problems were not motivated by time or cost savings.  It's not clear how long the affected aircraft will remain grounded. The actual modifications required are expected to be relatively simple and are only expected to cost about $2,250 (\u00a31,600) per aircraft. But the FAA is understood to be asking for detailed analysis to be sure all potential concerns have been dealt with. With the scrutiny the 737 Max is under, neither Boeing, nor the FAA, can afford to make a mistake.",

            "text": "While even nightclubbers can get back to throwing some maskless shapes and 'vertical drinkers' will be allowed, from Monday, to prop up bars until they become horizontal, at least two parts of the economy still languish: city centres, bereft of office workers and their footfall, and international travel. Staycations are booming across rural Britain. The most attractive places are rammed. My experience of Lochaber on Sunday was of being unable to find a parking space in most lay-bys. But city centre hotels have very low occupancy and booking rates, and the Scottish Tourism Alliance is pushing ministers to support them further. Part of their problem is in the lack of business travel, and international tourism.  Inbound and outbound, it looks likely to be the sector most likely to suffer a financial version of long Covid, and that's partly because vaccine nationalism has left large parts of the world lagging far behind with even a first jab. \"We're the only industry still effectively in lockdown,\" says pilots' union Balpa. Relaxing rules for quarantine, including inbound travellers from France, the biggest international tourist destination, is being greeted with some relief in aviation circles. But the green list remains short. A few countries are moving into less restricted categories, and Spain has avoided a downgrade. But beware of what's happening with Spain, warn UK and Scottish governments, a new variant has arrived there from South America.  However, the downgrade of Mexico, requiring quarantine after this Sunday, is a reminder that foreign travel remains highly unpredictable, and is bound to have a chilling effect on bookings. According to Skyscanner, the Edinburgh-based booking website, the trends they are seeing are of more focused on shorter-haul breaks, to stay close to home. Long-haul is almost all about visiting friends and family. To give some context, the global airlines organisation IATA has put out its figures for 2020, which shows the loss per passenger carried was US$71 (\u00a351). While cargo was a happier story for the industry, don't be surprised if airlines look to recoup those vast losses with higher prices than you might have seen before. More recent figures for this year point to continued pain for the industry, and particularly in Europe. The number of flights in May was down 85% on the same month in 2019, and in June it was down 77%. Paid passenger kilometres were down 69% on June 2019, with a global figure of -60%. There are signs of recovery, even including the makers of aircraft Boeing and Airbus and engine-maker Rolls-Royce.  It helps to have pressure to cut emissions with more efficient designs. The US manufacturer has reported it is out of the red, after two very expensive years when it had to halt production of its latest 737 model due to faulty software causing them to crash. Europe's Airbus reported an improved outlook on financials and orders, despite the dire straits facing its customers.  Rolls-Royce has today announced \u00a3307m profit for the first half of its year, compared with a \u00a31.6bn loss this time last year. What that means on the ground is harder to tell. The hub-and-spoke model of flying has been strengthened by the removal of less lucrative direct routes from airports such as Scotland's. It may be some time yet before Edinburgh and Glasgow see the return of direct, long-haul flights linking with the Middle East and North America.  Airports and the many companies that feed off them, including the higher-spending end of the tourist industry, are not yet cleared for take-off. ",

The move is thought to be the first formal cancellation of an order for the aircraft.  A Garuda spokesperson said passengers had \"lost trust\" in the plane.  It comes as investigators work to establish the cause of a recent crash involving a 737 Max 8, which killed 157 people.  It was the second fatal disaster involving the jet in five months. A Lion Air flight crashed in October, killing 189 people.  \"We have sent a letter to Boeing requesting that the order be cancelled,\" Garuda spokesman Ikhsan Rosan told AFP. \"The reason is that Garuda passengers in Indonesia have lost trust and no longer have the confidence\" in the plane he said, adding that the airline was awaiting a response from Boeing. Garuda did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. A spokesperson for Boeing was \"unable to comment on customer discussions\".  Garuda had already received one of the 737 Max 8 planes, AFP reported, part of a 50-plane order worth $4.9bn (\u00a33.7bn) at list prices when it was announced in 2014. Garuda was among Boeing's customers that had indicated they could scrap their orders.  for the 737 Max jets but the Indonesian airline appears the first to take action.  While there is no conclusive evidence so far that the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air disasters are linked, French experts analysing the Ethiopian Airlines' flight data black box say early investigations point to \"clear similarities\". Experts believe a new automated system in Boeing's aircraft - intended to stop stalling by dipping the nose - may have played a role in both crashes, with pilots unable to override it. The company said a software update is coming following the crash of the Lion Air flight.  Investigators intend to to issue a preliminary report into the Ethiopian Airlines disaster by mid-April.",

            "text": "Aerospace giant Airbus is to furlough 3,200 staff at its north Wales site, the company has announced. It comes hours after Chief Executive Guillaume Faury warned the company was \"bleeding cash at an unprecedented speed\". Airbus said about half of the staff at its Broughton site would be placed on the UK government's job retention scheme, which pays 80% of wages. The company is expected to top up salaries by a further 5-10%. The furlough periods of production and support staff will be staggered over the next three weeks. The remaining staff will stay on site, including 500 who are currently working at the AMRC Cymru facility, building parts for ventilators as part of the Ventilator Challenge UK consortium.  This month the firm announced it was cutting aircraft production by a third. It comes as the aviation industry is expected to shrink significantly in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. Mr Faury also told Airbus' 135,000 staff to brace for potentially deep job cuts and warned that its survival was at stake without immediate action. The Welsh Government said it was working with the company and to support its highly-skilled workers, while the UK government said its furlough scheme would help firms \"to bounce back and get the economy up and running once the coronavirus emergency is over\". Airbus is this week due to deliver financial results for the first quarter of the year. Those figures will be overshadowed by the pandemic that has left global airlines struggling to survive and almost completely halted plane deliveries since lockdowns started in March. Greg Waldron, from the aviation industry news website Flight Global, highlighted the huge impact of coronavirus on Airbus and the sector as a whole, saying: \"Every assumption we had about the industry has been totally upended.  \"The outlook for Airbus has gone from very positive to very negative. There's simply no demand for new aircraft at the moment.\" In response to the pandemic Airbus had already begun implementing government-assisted furlough schemes starting with 3,000 workers in France and said it would lower output of its narrow-body jets to 40 a month. Airbus has around 13,500 workers in the UK, with most of them making wings at its two major sites in Broughton, in Flintshire, and Filton, Bristol. Despite the major blow the coronavirus has dealt to Airbus, Mr Waldron thinks it will survive this crisis but not without significant layoffs. \"Airbus is a crucially important industrial programme for Europe, I think Europe will be committed to keeping Airbus going,\" he said.  \"However, there's going to be a great deal of pain to go through. If they cut production rates quite significantly you're going to see large numbers of layoffs. I would expect in a few years you'll see a smaller leaner Airbus than what we have now.\" Meanwhile, Airbus' main rival Boeing is battling another major crisis due to the year-long grounding of its 737 Max passenger jet, which had been its best-selling plane. On Saturday, the US aviation giant scrapped a $4.2bn (\u00a33.4bn) tie-up with Brazil's Embraer. Some industry analysts saw the move as being triggered by the crises, although the company cited contractual reasons for the decision.",

            "title": "Iran plane crash: Tor-M1 missiles fired at Ukraine jet",
            "text": "Iran has confirmed that two Tor-M1 surface-to-air missiles were fired at the Ukrainian airliner that crashed near Tehran earlier this month. The Civil Aviation Organisation of Iran (CAOI) said the Russian-made missiles were launched from the north. But it added that \"the impact of these missiles\" was still being assessed. Iran's armed forces have said they fired at Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 by mistake on 8 January, killing all 176 people on board. For the first three days after the tragedy, they denied any responsibility and the CAOI suggested there had been a technical failure. But as evidence mounted, the Revolutionary Guards' Aerospace Force said the operator of an air defence system had mistaken the Boeing 737-800 for a US cruise missile and fired at it. Iran's air defences had been on high alert at the time because the country had just fired ballistic missiles at two US bases in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike in Baghdad. In its second preliminary report on flight PS752, the CAOI identified the surface-to-air missiles fired at flight PS752 as coming from a Tor-M1 system, which Nato calls the SA-15 \"Gauntlet\".  However, the report stopped short of blaming the missiles for the crash, saying \"the impact of these missiles on the accident and the analysis of this action is under investigation\". Security camera footage circulated on social media had suggested that the plane was struck by two missiles within 23 seconds, shortly after taking off from Imam Khomeini International Airport.  Two unverified photographs purportedly taken near the crash site, also shared on social media, had meanwhile appeared to show the debris of an anti-aircraft missile.   The CAOI report also said Iranian investigators had found it \"impossible\" to read the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders - commonly known as the \"black boxes\" - because they were too advanced. They therefore sent a request for the equipment required to France's BEA air accident investigation agency and the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). However, neither had \"so far responded positively\", the CAOI added. \"If the appropriate supplies and equipment are provided, the information can be taken out and reconstructed in a short period of time,\" it noted. The Boeing 737-800 was designed and built in the US, while the plane's engine was designed by CFM International, a French-American venture owned by Safran and General Electric. In a telephone call on Sunday, representatives of Ukraine and four other countries which lost citizens in the tragedy - Canada, Sweden, Afghanistan and the UK - agreed Iran had been \"co-operating with foreign experts in the investigation to date\".  But they also emphasised that it was \"imperative that Iran allow for a thorough and credible international safety investigation into the causes of the crash\" and that it \"assume full responsibility, including by providing compensation\". The five countries also called on Iran to \"move the black boxes to a facility with all of the technology and expertise required to quickly and reliably download and analyse the data without delay\", as prescribed by international conventions. On Saturday, the head of the CAOI's accident investigations unit, Hassan Rezaeifar, was quoted by the semi-official Tasnim news agency as saying the black boxes would be sent to Ukraine. But the following day Mr Rezaeifar told the state news agency, Irna: \"We have no plans to send them out.\" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in Winnipeg on Tuesday that Iran did not have the technological capacity or the expertise to analyse the black boxes properly. \"There has been broad consensus in the international community that France would be the right place to send those boxes, [and] we continue to pressure Iran to do just that,\" he said. Mr Trudeau announced on Saturday that the Canadian government would give 25,000 Canadian dollars ($19,100; \u00a314,700) to the families of the 57 victims who were Canadian citizens and the 29 others who were permanent residents to help with their immediate needs.",

            "title": "How did President Zelensky get to Washington?",
            "text": "The extraordinary measures taken to transport Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from Ukraine to the US capital are a sign of just how crucial the relationship is for both countries. After visiting the front line in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday, Mr Zelensky's journey to Washington DC began with an overnight train journey to Poland before boarding a US Air Force plane, reportedly supported by a Nato spy-plane and an F-15 fighter jet.  Reports of the visit to Washington began circulating early this week, but it wasn't confirmed until early on Wednesday morning, when US officials felt certain that Ukraine's leader was safely en route to the US capital.  The visit had been discussed for months but the final preparations were made quickly - the two presidents spoke about it on 11 December and an invitation was extended to Mr Zelensky three days later. Only once the visit had been confirmed could final plans be put into action.  Unsurprisingly, no official information about the journey was released - security is tight around presidential visits even during peacetime, but for a wartime leader the risks are greater still.  With the threat of Russian missiles making air travel over Ukraine too risky, Mr Zelensky appears to have taken a secretive train ride through Ukraine to Poland, where he was spotted early on Wednesday at a railway station in the border town of Przemysl.   Pictures from Polish TV showed an entourage including Mr Zelensky walking along a platform with a blue-yellow Ukrainian train in the background. The group then got into a convoy of waiting cars, including black Chevrolet Suburbans - a favourite model of the US government.  Many Western leaders and officials have travelled by train to visit Mr Zelensky in Kyiv, but this was his first time abroad since Russia's war began. Not long afterwards, flight data showed a US Air Force Boeing C-40B - thought to be transporting Mr Zelensky - taking off from Rzeszow airport some 80km (50 miles) to the west. The plane headed northwest towards the United Kingdom, but before it entered the airspace above the North Sea, a Nato spy-plane scanned the area. The sea is known to be patrolled by Russian submarines.  And a US F-15 fighter jet, which took off from a base in England, escorted Mr Zelensky's flight for part of its journey.  Finally, around noon in Washington - nearly 10 hours after take-off and many more hours of travel for the Ukrainian president - the plane landed near Washington.  On arrival, he was given Secret Service protection - as is the case for all visiting heads of state - but Mr Zelensky's status as leader of a country at war with Russia meant security officials were being extra-vigilant.  \"We are very cognisant that Russia has assets in this country and might try to do something,\" one senior official told ABC News. \"We know what is at stake.\" Despite the concerns, the visit appeared to pass smoothly. On Thursday he stopped briefly in Poland on his way home to meet his counterpart, Andrzej Duda. And by Friday he was back at his desk in Kyiv, posting a short video on Telegram: \"We are working towards victory,\" he said. ",

BA will be the first Western airline to resume services to the country.  A new airport was opened recently in Islamabad, which has eased concerns about both security and congestion. The attack on the Marriott was one of the most high-profile attacks in Pakistan's history. Thomas Drew, the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, said BA's return was a \"reflection of the great improvements\" in security. BA's Robert Williams said: \"It's exciting to be flying between Islamabad and Heathrow from next year, which we believe will be particularly popular with the British Pakistani community who want to visit, or be visited by, their relatives.\" More than a million people of Pakistani origin live in the UK.  BA, which is owned by airline group IAG, aims to run three flights a week, starting on 2 June. Currently, Pakistan's PIA is the only airline to run direct flights from Pakistan to Britain.",

            "text": "The head of Europe's aviation safety agency, EASA, has said Boeing's 737 Max plane will get final clearance to resume flying in Europe next week. The agency suspended all flights of the plane in March 2019, after two fatal crashes that have been attributed to flawed flight control software.  A total of 346 people died in the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. The modified plane has already been cleared for the resumption of flights in the US and Brazil. EASA executive director Patrick Ky said a separate certification of the Max-200 variant was likely to follow in \"coming weeks\", allowing flights to resume before summer. The plane's first accident occurred in October 2018, when a Lion Air jet came down in the sea off Indonesia. The second involved an Ethiopian Airlines version that crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, just four months later. Both have been attributed to flight control software that became active at the wrong time and prompted the aircraft to go into a catastrophic dive. Since the Ethiopian crash, EASA has been carrying out a root-and-branch review of the 737 Max's design, independently from a similar process undertaken by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In order to return to service, existing planes will now have to be equipped with new computer software, as well as undergoing changes to their wiring and cockpit instrumentation.  Pilots will need to undergo mandatory training, while each plane will have to undergo a test flight to ensure the changes have been carried out correctly.  US regulators have set out similar conditions.",

Michael Bisgrove, 54, directed the green laser at the TUI jet, dazzling the pilot and crew as they came in to land at Cardiff Airport in April 2018. When a police helicopter searched for Bisgrove he shone the laser into the eyes of the three-man crew, putting their lives at risk. He was jailed for 32 months. The jet was bringing passengers to Cardiff from Gran Canaria when the crew were dazzled at 2,500 ft (762m) over Llantwit Major. Newport Crown Court heard the pen, capable of causing retinal damage, was aimed at the South Wales Police helicopter three times as it hovered at 1,000 ft (305m) looking for him. Prosecutor Anthony Cheung said: \"Captain Robin Small was flying the Boeing 737 when a laser beam was shone through the front window of the cockpit. \"The dazzling light caused Captain Small and his crew difficulty when it\u00a0shone into the cockpit for about a minute.\" Judge Richard Williams said father-of-three Bisgrove, of Berry Court, Boverton, Llantwit Major, could have caused a \"catastrophe\".

He admitted two charges of directing a laser beam towards an aeroplane and helicopter.\u00a0 Adam Sharp, defending, said: \"He doesn't have any interest in aeronautics or aeroplanes, this was totally out of character. \"His actions amount to complete stupidity rather than any intent to cause harm.\" A spokesman for TUI welcomed the jail sentence and praised the aircraft's captain and crew for its handling of the situation.",

            "text": "Investigative journalist Roman Dobrokhotov has spent more than five years researching the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17, which killed 298 people in 2014.  \"I think there are not so many things in the world that are proven better than that Russia is responsible for shooting down MH17,\" Roman tells me. \"We have photos, we have audio recordings of telephone calls, we have witnesses, we have interviews with people who were on the ground.\" The trial of four suspects - three Russian men and a Ukrainian man, all ex-security officers - opened in the Netherlands on Monday. Most of the MH17 victims were Dutch. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) says it has proof that the missile system used to shoot down the Malaysian Boeing 777 over eastern Ukraine came from a military base in neighbouring Russia.  But Moscow continues to reject all the evidence presented thus far, including photos, videos, intercepted telephone calls and social media posts that appear to link the Buk launcher to Russia, and the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine to the Russian state.  Russian officials dismiss the MH17 trial as \"political\".  All four accused are still at large. They are: Igor Girkin (ex-FSB colonel); Sergei Dubinsky (ex-GRU); Oleg Pulatov (ex-GRU) and Leonid Kharchenko (Ukrainian, ex-rebel commander), the indictment says. \"We are watching, we are hearing that those who are guilty have already been nominated,\" foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova tells me. \"We are watching the situation when the media is used as a weapon in the battle. It's a real pressure on the court.\"  Ms Zakharova denied reports that Russia had refused to co-operate with the international investigation.  \"We sent lots of materials upon their request on different issues. We answered all the questions. Probably not all the questions. I cannot be that precise. But mostly.\"  Since 2014, state media in Russia have spread a number of conspiracy theories about MH17, including that the plane was shot down by a Ukrainian fighter jet, or by a Ukrainian missile. The JIT has disproved such allegations. \"The Russian authorities are trying to create a situation where the information space is full of noise with all these fakes, disinformation and conspiracy theories,\" Roman Dobrokhotov believes.  \"A normal person fails to find truth in this noise and decides it is impossible, that there is no reason even to try to look for truth there, because we will never know it.\" For the Russian state, denial has become the most common response to incoming accusations. And in recent years there have been plenty of those, including of election meddling, hacking, the Salisbury poisoning and of Russian troop deployments to eastern Ukraine.  \"Why does Russia never admit to anything?\" I ask state TV talk show host Vladimir Solovyov. \"That's easy, you never have evidence,\" he replies. \"And you've always been accusing Russia, going back to the 19th Century. At the same time, you never admit your own faults.\" \"Doesn't it worry you that your country has developed a reputation for being a global denier or liar?\" I ask. \"Definitely not. Are you the one that is always trying to tell the truth? Are you talking about Boris Johnson? Is he the most truthful person in the world? Are you pulling my leg? Come on. Wake up!\" \"You keep talking and keep talking on issues you cannot prove,\" Maria Zakharova accuses me. \"And you're doing that on purpose. You're shaping the perception that Russia is guilty. That's propaganda. I'm sorry. You are a piece of propaganda.\"  Referring to the March 2018 Salisbury poisoning, Ms Zakharova complains that \"Russian citizens were accused publicly\" of trying to kill the Skripals \"with no evidence - how can you do this to them?\"  \"You mean those two people who claimed to be tourists, but were [Russian] GRU agents?\" I ask. \"We're not talking about what organisation they belonged to,\" she replies. \"How are those two guys connected to what happened to the Skripals? Probably they were near this place. Probably they touched something. Probably they - I don't know - gave him some medicine. What happened? Can you tell me?\" Does denying everything have political consequences?  \"Russia is getting away with it,\" concludes political scientist Andrei Zubov. He points out that Western leaders are still happy \"to work with Putin, out of profit.  \"It's useful for Britain, America and Germany to have some political and economic contacts with Russia.\"  In Russia many people do not care enough to question the official version of events.  \"There are some people who are interested in facts and they can find the truth,\" journalist Roman Dobrokhotov tells me. \"But there are others who are not really that motivated to find the truth. Of course it is easier to manipulate them with instruments, like trolls, hackers, and fake news.\" ",

            "text": "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said it will not ground the Boeing 737 Max aircraft despite mounting pressure. The US regulator said a review showed \"no systemic performance issues\" with the aircraft. An Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed on Sunday killing all 157 people on board, in the second fatal accident involving the 737 Max 8 model in five months. Numerous countries have banned the plane from their airspace.  On Wednesday Hong Kong, Vietnam and New Zealand joined the list of countries that had banned 737 Max models.  The UK, China, the European Union and Australia had previously done so. Ted Cruz, a Republican senator who chairs a subcommittee on aviation and space, said: \"I believe it would be prudent for the US likewise to temporarily ground 737 Max aircraft until the FAA confirms the safety of these aircraft and their passengers.\" Democratic senators Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal have written to the FAA - which they referred to as \"our aviation safety cop on the beat\" - asking that the Boeing 737 Max should be grounded \"until the agency can conclusively determine that the aircraft can be operated safely\". Democrat presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren said that the FAA should follow other nations' lead \"immediately\" and \"get these planes out of the sky\". And Republican senator Mitt Romney said: \"Out of an abundance of caution for the flying public, the FAA should ground the 737 Max 8 until we investigate the causes of recent crashes and ensure the plane's airworthiness.\"  But the FAA said that other civil aviation authorities had not \"provided data to us that would warrant action\". Boeing has confirmed that for the past few months it has been developing a \"flight control software enhancement\" for the aircraft, but says it is confident they are safe to fly. Airline workers also want the FAA to ground the Boeing 737 Max.  The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA union said it is calling on the FAA \"to temporarily ground the 737 MAX fleet in the US out of an abundance of caution\". Its president Sara Nelson, said: \"The US has the safest aviation system in the world, but Americans are looking for leadership in this time of uncertainty. \"The FAA must act decisively to restore the public faith in the system.  The Allied Pilots Association told its members: \"It is important for you to know that if you feel it is unsafe to work the 737 Max, you will not be forced to fly it.\" Southwest Airlines and American Airlines - both major operators of the Boeing 737 Max - are continuing to use the planes.  Southwest Airlines is offering passengers scheduled to fly on one of the Boeing planes the chance to change their bookings. American Airlines said its \"standard policies for changes still apply\". The Boeing 737 Max fleet of aircraft are the latest in the company's successful 737 line. The group includes the Max 7, 8, 9 and 10 models. By the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 of the Max 8 model out of 5,011 orders. A small number of Max 9s are also operating.  The Max 7 and 10 models, not yet delivered, are due for roll-out in the next few years. The Max 8 that crashed on Sunday was one of 30 ordered as part of Ethiopian Airlines' expansion. It underwent a \"rigorous first check maintenance\" on 4 February, the airline said. Following last October's Lion Air crash in Indonesia, investigators said the pilots had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling, a new feature of the jet. It is not yet clear whether the anti-stall system was the cause of Sunday's crash. Aviation experts say other technical issues or human error cannot be discounted. Eyewitnesses say they saw a trail of smoke, sparks and debris as the plane nosedived. Have you been personally affected by this story? Please get in touch with us by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

            "text": "Relatives of the passengers and crew on board the ill-fated Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737 are facing an agonising wait as authorities search for the wreckage. Sixty-two people were on board the passenger plane which plunged into the sea just minutes after taking off from Jakarta on Saturday. There appears to be no hope of finding survivors. Although no-one on board has been formally identified, information is emerging from family and friends. \"We're in grief, still praying for the best,\" said Ferza Mahardhika, whose uncle was the pilot of the Sriwijaya SJ182 flight.  Captain Afwan, 54, left home quickly on the day of the doomed flight, his nephew told BBC Indonesia, complaining that \"his shirt hadn't been ironed, when usually he is really neat\". The captain apologised to his three children for having to leave them again. Captain Afwan, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, started his flying career in the air force before becoming a commercial pilot in 1987.  His family and colleagues say he was devoted Muslim, eager to help people in his neighbourhood in the West Java town of Bogor, and at work.   His profile picture on social media is a cartoon of Superman praying, with the words \"it doesn't matter how high you fly, you will never reach heaven if you don't pray\". \"He was a very good man. He often gave advice, wise advice. He was a prominent figure in his neighbourhood and was well-known for his kindness,\" said Ferza Mahardhika. \"I'm devastated and can't believe that this is happening. Please pray for uncle and our family,\" he added. Also on board was 15-year-old Dinda Amelia, who had originally gone to Jakarta on vacation.  Dinda had gone with her mother's employer whom she was close to, along with the family's two children.  Lena, her mother, said she had been working for her employer's family for a long time, and so did not refuse Dinda's request to follow the family on vacation. They left for Jakarta on 27 December - but never returned. \"She left right on her 15th birthday,\" her mother told BBC Indonesian. \"She was very happy.\" Speaking to reporters, Lena showed them a photo of Dinda on her phone, while crying and saying: \"Come back little one.\"  Afrida told BBC Indonesia she was still holding out hope that her 29-year-old son Angga Fernanda Afrion, who was on the flight, might still be alive.  \"Family members who are in Jakarta are searching for information. I want to go, too, but with the pandemic it's difficult to travel,\" said Afrida, who lives in West Sumatra.  Just a week ago Angga - a seaman - had become a father, his wife giving birth to their first child, a boy named Alvano Faeyza Alingga. His mother said that becoming a father had motived him to work harder to provide the best for his son.  Angga worked on large cargo boats. His mother says he called her late on Friday saying that he had to fly to Pontianak at the last minute because \"his ship was damaged and his boss had told him he needed to come\". He often had to travel for work across the Indonesian archipelago but preferred to travel by boat, rarely flying.  Afrida said her son was \"a strong-willed child but was very obedient. He was a kind polite person and could get on well with anyone.\"  \"If he is gone what I want is to be able to bring him home and bury him properly,\" she said quietly, while holding a framed photo of Angga in his uniform.  Also on board were newly married couple Ihsan Adhlan Hakim and Putri Wahyuni. Ihsan's younger brother, Arwin Amru Hakim, told news website Kompas that his brother had called from Soekarno Hatta Airport to let the family know their flight had been delayed, due to bad weather. The couple were travelling to Kalimantan to hold a wedding party for Ihsan's extended family who live in Pontianak.   \"The plan was that next Saturday the event would take place,\" said Arwin. But now, he says, the family are praying together.  Yusrilanita fainted when told the news about the Sriwijaya Air SJ182 aircraft that was carrying her daughter Indah Halima Putri, son-in-law Muhammad Rizky Wahyudi and their baby. Indah had returned to her family home in Java to give birth, and was now going home with her husband to their home in Pontianak.  Before the plane took off, according to local media, Indah send a photo of the plane's wing via a WhatsApp message saying there was heavy rain and asking for the family's prayers.  Meanwhile, authorities have set up a special centre at Pontianak Supadio Airport in Indonesia to take DNA samples from close family of those on board to help with identification. \"We have deployed 51 personnel to be on standby at the post to work with personnel from the Disaster Victim Identification team to collect the samples,\" said Assistant Senior Commissioner of Police Yani Permana. The process is expected to take at least two more days as some families have to travel to reach the centre. The 30-year-old businessman was in Jakarta on a business trip and was on his way back home to his family in Ngarak, a village several hours from Pontianak airport, according to news site CNN. His wife told CNN that she spoke with her husband - whom she describes as a \"very good and sociable person\" - shortly before takeoff. \"His last message to me was not to forget to take our son to see a doctor because he had a fever,\" she said, adding that the couple's five-year-old son has been asking when his father is coming home.

Air traffic tried to contact them after they overshot the point of descent into Ethiopia's Addis Ababa airport. The pilots eventually woke up and landed the plane on its second approach, the Aviation Herald said. The Ethiopian Airlines crew have been put on leave pending investigation, state-run news outlet Fana reported. Monday's passenger flight took off from Sudan's Khartoum airport. The Boeing 737, with a 154-seat capacity, normally takes less than two hours on its route between the neighbouring countries. Reactions to sleeping on the job ranged from sympathy with the pilots' work schedule to shock that they fell asleep on the job. \"I wouldn't cast blame on the Ethiopian crew specifically here - this is something that could happen to ANY crew in the world and it probably DID happen... The blame lies on the corporation and the regulators,\" read one comment on the Aviation Herald website.  Another user suggested that there was only one solution: \"Termination. End of story. Full stop.\" Others saw the funny side of the story, comment on Twitter, \"Sleeping on the job taken to new heights!\" An aviation analyst called the incident \"deeply concerning\" on Twitter. \"Pilot fatigue is nothing new, and continues to pose one of the most significant threats to air safety - internationally,\" tweeted aviation analyst, Alex Macheras. In a press release, Ethiopian Airlines confirmed that the the crew had been removed from future flights pending further investigation. \"Appropriate corrective action will be taken based on the outcome of the investigation\" the statement read.  \"Safety has always been and will continue to be our first priority.\"",

            "text": "President Donald Trump has reached an informal deal with Boeing to provide two Air Force One planes for $3.9bn (\u00a32.8bn), the White House has said. A White House spokesperson said the agreement would save US taxpayers more than $1.4bn. The deal follows a row over the cost of the planes. In December 2016, Mr Trump said they were too expensive and the order should be cancelled. Boeing said that Mr Trump had \"negotiated a good deal\". In a statement, the US aerospace giant said: \"Boeing is proud to build the next generation of Air Force One, providing American Presidents with a flying White House at outstanding value to taxpayers\". A Boeing official said the price included fitting out the two 747-8 planes with a communications suite each, internal and external stairs, and large galleys and other equipment. In addition, there are structural changes that have been made to the aircraft \"to protect and sustain the president and those on board for an extended period of time\", the official said. The planes are designed to be an airborne White House, able to fly in worst-case security scenarios, such as nuclear war, and are modified with military avionics, advanced communications and a self-defence system. The government had a contract with Boeing to build two or more new planes. But in 2016, before Mr Trump was president, he tweeted that they were too expensive. \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" he said. At the time, The White House appeared to cast doubt on the figures quoted by Mr Trump. \"Some of the statistics that have been cited, shall we say, don't appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defence,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. The $1.4bn Mr Trump claimed would be saved on the new planes has not been independently verified.  US aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said Boeing would only have so much room to offer discounts given the high proportion of third party equipment that would be used on the aircraft.  \"There's no evidence of a discount,\" he said adding that the White House was engaging in \"political theatre\". Technically, \"Air Force One\" is a call sign for any aircraft carrying the US president.  However the term is mostly used to refer to the current fleet - two highly customised Boeing 747-200B jets,  which have been in service since 1990. The planes are:",

            "title": "Airbus scraps A380 superjumbo jet as sales slump",
            "text": "European aircraft manufacturer Airbus has pulled the plug on its struggling A380 superjumbo, which entered service just 12 years ago. Airbus said last deliveries of the world's largest passenger aircraft, which cost about $25bn (\u00a319.4bn) to develop, would be made in 2021. The decision comes after Emirates, the largest A380 customer, cut its order. The A380 faced fierce competition from smaller, more efficient aircraft and has never made a profit. The A380's future had been in doubt for several years as orders dwindled. But in a statement on Thursday, Airbus said the \"painful\" decision to end production was made after Emirates reduced its latest order. The Dubai-based airline is cutting its overall A380 fleet size from 162 to 123.   Emirates said it would take delivery of 14 further A380s over the next two years, but has also ordered 70 of Airbus' smaller A330 and A350 models. \"Emirates has been a staunch supporter of the A380 since its very inception,\" said the airlines' chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum. \"While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the programme could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation,\" he added. The order cut meant keeping production going was not viable, said Airbus chief executive Tom Enders, who is due to step down in April.  There was \"no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years\" he said.  Airbus has taken a \u20ac463m charge for shutdown costs, but it is expected that the repayment of government loans could be waived to help cushion the blow.  The aerospace giant said the financial impact of the decision was \"largely embedded\" in the firm's 2018 results, which showed a net profit for 2018 of \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.6bn) up nearly 30% from the previous year.  Airbus said it would deliver between 880 and 890 new commercial aircraft this year.  Airbus said it would start discussions with partners regarding the \"3,000 to 3,500 positions potentially impacted over the next three years\". The BBC understands that around 200 jobs in the UK could be under threat from the decision. Airbus confirmed it hopes to redeploy a \"significant\" number of affected staff to other projects.  Mr Enders said: \"It needs to be evaluated. It's clear we make a lot of wings in Britain and a few wings for the A380.  \"Hopefully we can redeploy a significant number of our employees there and re-use also the infrastructure.\" Airbus UK makes the wings for its wide variety of aircraft in the UK. The company employs about 6,000 staff at its main wings factory at Broughton in Flintshire, as well as 3,000 at Filton, near Bristol, where wings are designed and supported. Parts of the A380 are manufactured in France, Germany, Spain, and the UK, with final assembly and finishing split between Toulouse and Hamburg.  Airbus had already cut staffing as A380 orders dried up, and the future of employment at the company very much now depends on the success of its new generation of aircraft. Unite, the largest union representing aerospace workers in the UK and Ireland, said it was \"bitterly disappointed\" by the news, adding it would seek \"urgent assurances\" from Airbus that there would be no job losses because of the decision. \"We are of the firm belief that with a full order book in single aisle planes, such as the A320, that our members affected can be redeployed on to other work in Airbus,\" said Rhys McCarthy, Unite's national officer for aerospace. The spacious jet, which had its first commercial flight in 2007 with Singapore Airlines, was popular with passengers but it was complicated and expensive to build, in part thanks to the way production was spread across various locations.  But ultimately demand for the A380 from airlines dried up as the industry shifted away from larger planes in favour of smaller, wide-body jets.  When Airbus was conceiving the A380, Boeing was also considering plans for a superjumbo. But the US company decided to scrap the idea in favour of its smaller, efficient - and more successful - 787 Dreamliner. \"The very clear trend in the market is to operate long-haul aircraft with two engines [such as] Boeing's 787 and 777, and Airbus's A330 and A350,\" said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor of Flight Global.  Airbus had been working on a revamped A380 to make it more efficient, but needed sufficient launch orders to make the huge investment viable. Despite Airbus' website describing the Airbus as the \"future of long-distance travel\" the last aircraft will be delivered in 2021. Analysis: By Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenter When Airbus's A380 first took off it was hailed as a technological marvel that would meet airlines' needs for a new large aircraft to connect the world's crowded airport hubs - London, New York, Dubai, Tokyo. Airbus said the market for the giant planes would be 1,500.  After today's decision to end production, it will have made just over 250. In hindsight, airlines were already turning their back on very large aircraft when the A380 made its debut.  Advances in engine technology meant planes no longer needed four engines to fly long distances - and carriers were able to use a new generation of light, fuel-efficient, twin-engined aircraft to link secondary cities, bypassing the crowded hubs altogether. Even though Airbus was aware of the threat posed by these new types of plane, they pressed ahead.  There was a bigger game afoot - Airbus needed to negate Boeing's 747, believing that the profits the American company made on 747 sales were helping it cross-subsidise other, smaller planes. The A380 succeeded in that - the last passenger 747 was built two years ago - but Boeing will have a kind of last laugh.  Freighter versions of the 747 will be built past 2021, meaning the venerable jumbo jet will outlive the plane sent to kill it.",

            "text": "The Pentagon has launched an inquiry into acting US Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan for alleged favouritism to his ex-employer, Boeing.  The Defence Department's inspector general will look into the matter following a complaint from a watchdog group.  Mr Shanahan is accused of frequently praising Boeing in meetings about government contracts and acquisitions.  Mr Shanahan, who denies any wrongdoing, spent 30 years at Boeing. He rose through the ranks to become a senior executive at the world's biggest planemaker.  Last week Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a complaint with the Pentagon inspector general about Mr Shanahan. The complaint said he had appeared to violate ethical rules by \"promoting Boeing in the scope of his official duties... and disparaging the company's competitors to his subordinates\". Dwrena Allen, a spokeswoman for the inspector general, said in a statement on Wednesday: \"The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General has decided to investigate complaints we recently received that Acting Secretary Patrick Shanahan allegedly took actions to promote his former employer, Boeing, and disparage its competitors.\" Mr Shanahan said last week during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that he would support an investigation by the inspector general. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a member of the panel, said she had led calls for the inquiry. She tweeted on Wednesday: \"Government officials should work for the people - not big defence contractors.\" The inquiry casts a shadow over Mr Shanahan as the White House considers whether to formally nominate him to fill the defence secretary post left vacant by Jim Mattis, who stepped down in December. Boeing is already under pressure after the deadly crash of one of its 737 Max 8 passenger jets in Ethiopia last week. The FBI is reported to be assisting the investigation into safety issues surrounding the Boeing airliner.  Another of the passenger planes crashed in Indonesia last October, also killing everyone on board.  According to the Seattle Times, the FBI is investigating the process that led to the aircraft getting its safety certification.   The US Department of Justice has refused to comment on claims that it has been looking at the Federal Aviation Administration's oversight of Boeing. ",

            "text": "A day after the MH17 plane crash inquiry team announced murder charges against four men, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has condemned the decision as \"ridiculous\". The three Russians and a Ukrainian are accused of bringing a missile into eastern Ukraine which shot the Malaysian Airlines plane down. All 298 people on board were killed. \"From the very beginning it became a political issue on how to accuse Russia of wrongdoing,\" Mr Mahathir said. Russian President Vladimir Putin also rejected the findings on Thursday. However, Malaysia is itself part of the Dutch-led joint investigation team (JIT), which has been working on the criminal inquiry for years. A foreign ministry statement said it remained committed to the inquiry process. Arriving at the EU summit in Brussels, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte criticised the Malaysian leader's remarks and said the foreign ministry in The Hague was in touch with its counterparts in Kuala Lumpur. \"I can imagine the relatives will be naturally very disappointed by it and it also causes confusion,\" he told reporters. The three Russians charged were all closely connected to Russian intelligence services, prosecutors said, and all four were involved in the conflict with the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine at the time the plane was shot down on 17 July 2014. A trial will open in the Netherlands on 9 March 2020, even if the suspects are not present. Russia has insisted that there is no concrete evidence to back up allegations that the missile came from its territory or that Russian officials have been involved in the separatist campaign against Ukrainian forces. But investigators have already produced evidence that they say proves the Buk anti-aircraft missile that brought down MH17 was transported to eastern Ukraine from the 53rd Russian military brigade based in Kursk. During Wednesday's JIT news conference, investigators also produced wiretapped audio of a phone-call six days before the crash. The call features Vladislav Surkov, a top aide to President Putin, discussing Russian military assistance with the ex-head of the rebel Donetsk republic, Alexander Borodai. A separate, earlier wiretap, investigators say, featured Igor Girkin appealing for anti-aircraft defence material from Sergei Aksenov, Russia's leader in recently annexed Crimea. Investigators say they want to know who was involved in the decision-making process in Russia, particularly who decided a Buk missile launcher would be sent to Ukraine and who would crew it. A Russian military expert told Tass news agency that when hostilities \"were in full swing\", Vladislav Surkov never spoke by phone with separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine for security reasons. The 93-year-old Malaysian leader went on to demand proof of Russian guilt, insisting \"so far, there is no proof, only hearsay\". When asked if his reaction had anything to do with sales of Malaysian palm oil, he said no. Palm oil is key to Malaysia's economy, for jobs and exports.  But earlier this year the European Commission recommended the phasing out of palm oil for use in biofuels for transport by 2030, deciding that palm oil production caused excessive deforestation. Malaysia has since announced it is keen to trade its palm oil in return for military equipment such as fighter jets to replace its ageing Russian-made fleet. Malaysian reports have recently quoted Russian officials as offering to increase palm oil purchases in return for a military deal.",

            "text": "Australian airline Qantas will place an order next year for planes capable of making the 20-hour flight between London and Sydney. Chief executive Alan Joyce told the BBC he was in advanced discussions with planemakers Airbus and Boeing.  Flights could start around 2022 if they produced the right aircraft, he said.  Qantas also plans to fly non-stop from Australia to North America - slightly shorter than the London-Sydney non-stop flight. Mr Joyce told the BBC's Today Programme he was confident there would be demand for the flight. \"Business traffic and general leisure customers would rather have the certainty of getting there direct, not having to stop, not having connections gone wrong, the extra speed that that entails is really important,\" he said.  In March, the airline launched non-stop flights between London and Perth, a flight lasting just over 17 hours.  Mr Joyce said since their launch the flights had on average been 92% full, with business class even higher at 94%. He said, however, that there was no plane yet that could handle the longer London and Sydney flight.  Qantas is considering the Airbus A350-1000 for the flight but said the plane would need \"modification\" because it \"needs a little bit more range to get there\".  Boeing's 777-8, the new version of its 777 plane, which is expected to be ready in 2022. is also under consideration.  If the non-stop flights - dubbed Project Sunrise - go ahead, Mr Joyce said the airline would also start offering non-stop flights to New York as well.  \"Qantas is unique because we can probably justify a large number of these long haul aircraft, given how far Australia is from the rest of the world,\" he said.  And Qantas is not the only airline targeting long non-stop flights.   Singapore Airlines will launch a non-stop flight in October from Singapore to Newark, New Jersey -  a journey that will take nearly 19 hours. Meanwhile, Qatar currently offers the longest non-stop flight available: its Auckland to Doha route which takes 17.5 hours. ",

            "title": "Boeing warns it may stop 737 Max production",
            "text": "Boeing is warning that it might have to halt production of the 737 Max if grounding continues much longer. The company reported its largest-ever quarterly loss of $3.4bn (\u00a32.7bn) on Wednesday due to the troubled plane. If hurdles with regulators worldwide continue, Boeing said it would consider reducing or shutting down production of the 737 Max entirely.  However, Boeing boss Dennis Muilenburg is confident the plane will be back in the air by October. \"As our efforts to support the 737 Max's safe return to service continue, we will continue to assess our production plans,\" Mr Muilenburg told investors in a conference call.    \"Should our estimate of the anticipated return to service change, we might need to consider possible further rate reductions or other options, including a temporary shutdown of the Max production.\" Boeing's entire fleet of flagship 737 Max planes was grounded in March after issues with the model were linked to an Ethiopian Airlines flight crash that killed 157 people. Five months earlier, 189 people were killed when a Boeing 737 Max operated by Lion Air crashed. As investigations into the two crashes continue, Boeing has been working on fixes for its Mcas anti-stall flight control software, as well as other issues identified by regulators, including the US Federal Aviation Administration.  Boeing, which has customers in 150 countries, is still waiting for approval from regulators.  Mr Muilenberg said the planemaker had been holding weekly technical calls with operators of the 737 Max, while the modified software had so far been tested in 225 flight simulator sessions. \"These are challenging times, first and foremost, for the families and loved ones who are affected by these recent events, and also for our dedicated people, who work tirelessly to deliver on our mission to connect, protect, explore and inspire the world, all with a relentless focus on quality and safety and doing so with the utmost integrity,\" he stressed.  \"This is a defining moment for Boeing and we're committed to coming through this challenging time better and stronger as a company.\" After the two crashes, production of the 737 Max was reduced from 52 to 42 aircraft per month, Mr Muilenburg said. The knock-on effect of this move is that Boeing has to pay more for plane parts than before, which are priced according to the volume purchased by the planemaker. Having to suspend deliveries of new 737 Max planes to airlines has also hit Boeing's cash flow and profit margins. Further reducing production of the plane would compound these problems, which could lead Boeing to halt production of the 737 Max completely - a move the company has not taken since it halted production of the 747 for 20 days in 1997, when demand outstripped supply of parts.  The grounding of the 737 Max and the cuts in production have both affected Boeing's customers and are likely to continue to cause plane delivery delays in the future, Mr Muilenberg acknowledged. \"I want to personally thank everyone who continues to be our partner in this journey; from our airline customers and their pilots, flight attendants and others who have been impacted by these groundings, representatives from all levels of government who share our commitment to safety for the flying public and everyone in the aviation community impacted by these events,\" he said.  \"We are grateful for your support and we will continue striving to earn and re-earn your trust.\"",

            "title": "Plane ticket prices soared by 44% in December",
            "text": "The price of air fares soared at a record rate in December while the cost of coach travel jumped, according to new data. Plane fares rose by 44.1% in the year to December, the largest increase since the late 1980s, official figures show. It was the first December since 2019 when people could travel to many long-haul destinations without Covid restrictions. Analysts said the main reason for the fare rises was aviation fuel prices. In the case of higher coach tickets, rail strikes may have increased demand. The price of coach travel rose by 17.5% in December compared with the same month in the previous year. Rail strikes in December caused disruption to passenger journeys, leading people to travel by road over the festive period. The higher ticket costs for both planes and coaches contributed to the overall inflation rate which was 10.5% in December. Inflation for last month slowed compared with November and October, but price rises are still running at close to a 40-year high. Airlines, like households and many other businesses, have been hit by significant rises in fuel costs in recent months. Fuel accounts for around one third of an airline's operating costs and prices have been rising. This has been passed on through tickets, according to aviation expert and consultant John Strickland. Sally Gethin, travel and aviation analyst, said airlines could not \"absorb the cost increase\" of fuel. She added that prices had risen \"because of increased long-haul journey times to avoid Russian and Ukrainian airspace, as well as a global shortage in spare parts and engines\". \"The UK also has the highest passenger tax in Europe, known as Air Passenger Duty, beyond the airlines' control, and this tax is also passed on to customers,\" she added. Mr Strickland also explained there had been \"upward pressure on staff costs\" as companies sought to restore staffing in a competitive jobs market. Many airlines cut jobs at the height of the pandemic when international travel was grounded. \"Lastly, demand in many markets had come back strongly whilst in many cases capacity has not or has struggled to keep up,\" Mr Strickland said. \"This has led to a tighter demand/capacity balance which has exerted upward pressure on prices.\" Despite rising prices, people appear to be willing to spend more on holidays. The Advantage Travel Partnership told the BBC that the average spending per holiday was \u00a33,104 in early January, up 5% on the previous year, despite the pressure on household finances. Spain is the most popular booking destination so far, along with Greece, the US and Turkey, according to the group, the UK's largest network of independent travel agents. Andri Benson, who runs a wedding planning business, has booked to go to the Greek island Rhodes with her parents, sister and niece in June. She told the BBC that the holiday was more expensive, but she wanted something to look forward to, adding: \"The feeling was if we are going to go on holiday, we want a nice place. I want to make the most of spending time with my parents.\" Passengers however could face delays and disruption to their travel as airport and rail strikes continue in 2023. Head of the PCS union said Border Force staff at airports, many of whom check passports, could continue striking throughout the year - although their walkouts in December led to minimal disruption as military staff provided cover. Train drivers belonging to the Aslef union are also due to go on strike on 1 and 3 February, which could lead to an increase in demand for bus and coach travel in the first half of this year. The ONS added that public transport by road saw average annual price rises of 11.3% in December.  Have rising costs affected your travel plans? Get in touch.",

            "text": "Relatives of 66 people who were on board a plane that crashed in Iran are desperately waiting for any news. State media says the Aseman Airlines passenger plane that came down in the Zagros mountains on Sunday has been found. All those on board are feared to have been killed. Heavy wind and snow forced rescuers to stop the search late on Sunday. The ATR 72-500 twin-engine turboprop was travelling from Tehran to the south-western city of Yasuj. Flight EP3704 left Tehran at 04:30 GMT on Sunday, and crashed about an hour later on Dena Mountain, near the city of Semirom in Isfahan province. The crash site is about 22km (14 miles) from Yasuj, Iranian media reported.  The crashed plane was 25 years old, Iran's civil aviation organisation said. Search and rescue teams were dispatched to look for the site where the plane came down, but were later forced to stop the operation.  \"With the wind intensifying, and with snow, rain and darkness, it is not possible for rescue and relief teams to reach high altitudes and the search operation has been postponed until tomorrow,\" broadcaster IRIB announced. \"Five helicopters are on alert to resume the search at dawn if the weather conditions are better.\"  Sixty passengers, two security guards, two flight attendants and the pilot and co-pilot were on board. Aseman Airline initially said everyone had been killed, but said later: \"Given the special circumstances of the region, we still have no access to the spot of the crash and therefore we cannot accurately and definitely confirm the death of all passengers of this plane.\" Passengers' relatives earlier gathered at a mosque near Tehran's Mehrabad airport, according to AFP news agency. \"I can't bring myself to believe it,\" said one woman whose husband was on the plane. One man told Tabnak news website that he had missed the flight.  Showing an unused ticket as proof, he said: \"God has been really kind to me but I am so sad from the bottom of my heart for all those dear ones who lost their lives.\" Iran's President Hassan Rouhani expressed sympathy for all involved, saying in a statement that the incident brought \"great grief and sorrow\". Iran has suffered several aviation accidents in recent years and has an ageing aircraft fleet.  The country has struggled to obtain spare parts to maintain its planes in the face of international sanctions imposed to curb its nuclear programme. Those sanctions have been mostly lifted under a 2015 deal between Iran and the US alongside several other powers.   Aseman, Iran's third largest airline, signed a contract with Boeing last year to buy 30 of its latest medium-range 737s.  Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has also expressed \"deep sympathy\" for relatives of those on board, saying the accident \"saddened the hearts\". Recent major air crashes in Iran August 2014: Sepahan airways Antonov carrying 40 crashes shortly after take-off from Tehran, killing 39 - engine failure blamed January 2011: IranAir Boeing 727 breaks up on landing in snowstorm in north-west, killing 78 July 2009: Caspian Airlines Tupolev bound for Armenia from Tehran catches fire shortly after take-off killing all 168 on board",

            "text": "\"I learn to cope but nothing will ever be the same again. I was at a party last night with people having fun, and it suddenly struck me that I'm no longer able to join in with things like that.\" Adrian Toole describes his daughter Joanna as a \"star\" destined to go on to greater things in her UN career. The 36-year-old was one of 157 people killed when an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed one year ago. It was the second time a Boeing 737 Max plane had crashed in the space of just five months. \"I don't think there's anything I could have done to stop her being on that plane. I didn't know any of the issues. Few people did know about them.\" Mr Toole is now calling for the UK government to remain a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).  EASA is the organisation in charge of regulating aviation safety in Europe. Among other things, it makes sure new types of aircraft are safe to fly and sets training requirements for pilots. The government has now confirmed that at the end of 2020, Britain will leave EASA after the Brexit transition period comes to a close.  \"Our government should ultimately be ensuring the safety of the travelling public. More people nowadays fly. People should be able to rely on whatever regulatory framework there is to keep them safe,\" Mr Toole says. \"I don't think you can rapidly replace the structure of EASA - so just take the difficult decision to remain a member.\" The Department for Transport (DfT) said being a member of EASA \"is not compatible with the UK having genuine economic and political independence\". A DfT spokesperson added: \"We will maintain world-leading safety standards for industry, with the Civil Aviation Authority [CAA] taking over these responsibilities, and will continue to work with colleagues in the EU to establish a new regulatory relationship.\" But Adrian Toole cited concerns with the CAA taking on a vast amount of work. He called it an \"impossible task\". \"What I would expect would happen is that we would end up 'rubber-stamping' decisions either taken in America by the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] or in Europe, without having any direct input. And that's not a good solution.\" In the wake of two crashes involving the 737 Max, the FAA faced criticism over the way in which it had delegated a large amount of safety work relating to the aircraft to Boeing itself. In January, its chief executive Steve Dickson insisted that the FAA was working alone on resolving issues with the 737 Max. He said: \"We're not delegating anything in this process.\" Adrian Toole suggests: \"The relationship between the FAA and Boeing was too close for comfort.\" He adds: \"I would certainly like to be able to trust [Boeing]. In the corporate world, putting safety first is the most difficult thing to actually achieve... I'm not convinced that the top management at Boeing are the people that are going to change this around.\" Boeing's new chief executive, David Calhoun, said last month he was \"confident in the future\" of the firm.  He told staff his \"primary focus\" would be returning the 737 Max to the skies. \"I see greatness in this company, but I also see opportunities to be better,\" he said. Europe's aviation regulator, EASA, has also reassured the families of victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash that it will \"take nothing for granted\" when it conducts its own assessment of the Boeing 737 Max before it is allowed to fly again in Europe.",

The airport wants to lengthen the runway by 164m (538ft) to increase the number of flights and allow the use of larger planes. An Eastleigh Borough Council committee was due to consider the application on 17 December. A council statement said the delay was at the request of Southampton Airport to submit additional information. No new date has been specified and the council said a further public consultation would be held on the new proposals, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Managing director at Southampton Airport Steve Szalay previously said the airport's future would be in doubt if it was not allowed to extend the runway to accommodate planes such as the Airbus 320 and Boeing 737. Passenger numbers at the airport have fallen by 89% this year. Local campaigners and Southampton City Council have objected to the plans on the grounds of climate change and noise levels. Earlier this year, Southampton Airport amended the proposals following a number of public consultations. Among the main changes were proposals to cap the airport's growth up to three million passengers per year by 2033. The airport also proposed to increase the financial compensation for acoustic insulation to nearby households to \u00a35,000. It is not yet known what additional information airport bosses will add to the plans.",

            "text": "After days of denial, the Iranian authorities admitted that a crash involving a Ukrainian International Airlines jetliner was caused by human error.  The incident on Wednesday came just hours after Iran had launched a series of ballistic missiles at Iraqi bases hosting US troops, in a bid to avenge the killing of senior commander Qasem Soleimani.  It was amid these high tensions, Iran says, that an air defence operator misidentified flight PS752 as a cruise missile and shot it down, killing all 176 people on board. While Iran initially denied responsibility, US and Canadian intelligence agencies soon uncovered evidence that one of the country's surface-to-air missile had caused the accident. This led to significant international pressure for Iran to openly investigate the case. Tehran's decision to reverse its initial statements and take full responsibility for the downing of the plane provoked a positive response from several countries, including those whose passengers were onboard - Canada, the UK, Germany, and Sweden.  The admission of guilt was ultimately read as a positive first step.  But officials from these governments also said the admission should be followed by constructive behaviour from Iran. This would likely mean it pursuing a transparent investigation, the repatriation of the bodies and compensation for the victims, as well as taking the necessary steps to ensure similar tragedies are averted in future. On the international front, the downing of flight PS752 is unlikely to result in further escalation and might even provide an opportunity for defusing some of the tensions which have been simmering over the past few months. On the domestic front, however, this tragic accident could have much deeper repercussions.  Just days before the flight crashed, Iran displayed an unprecedented level of unity and popular support when millions of people poured on to the streets all over the country to mourn the death of Soleimani.  This seemed to indicate that, when faced with the external threat of military confrontation, Iranians from different political and economic backgrounds could come together and put aside their divisions. But the shooting down of flight PS752 and the subsequent denials from the authorities could lead these divisions to re-emerge and become even sharper.  While the admission of guilt could assuage some of the popular criticism towards the grave mishandling of the situation, the establishment might still be perceived as having tried to hide evidence and avoid responsibility before international pressure mounted on Iran to come clean. This is likely to revive the divisions and unrest that erupted in November when the Iranian government approved a sharp spike in fuel prices. This move triggered large demonstrations across the country and resulted in widespread repression and the killing of at least 300 people. While acknowledging the truth is an important first step, the Iranian people will likely demand accountability and the prosecution of those responsible, as well as the adoption of all the steps needed to ensure this does not happen again. They will also pay attention to how the victims of the air crash are treated by the Iranian elite. An important test here is whether their funerals will result in national mourning, similar to that of Soleimani, or instead be largely ignored. All of these demands will be added to previous grievances over the state of the economy and the limitations on some social freedoms. Parliamentary elections are due to take place in just over a month and internal discord over this crash could lead to further unrest. Plus, tension with the West has abated but is far from over.  The way in which the government and the rest of the establishment handle the broader repercussions of this plane crash could be a watershed moment for Iran. The choices it makes are likely to reverberate throughout Iranian politics and society for months, or even years, to come.",

The Suffolk airbase will be the first place outside the United States that Joe Biden has visited since becoming president following his election victory over Donald Trump last November. \"It has been very busy for the past three days, seeing the [Lockheed] C-5 Galaxy and the [Boeing] C-17 Globemaster, it has been brilliant,\" says Mrs Williams. \"It is just, the size of it, how it gets off the floor is amazing.  \"We've been doing it for years since the kids were little.\" And as for the arrival of the US President? \"That will be really great,\" says Mrs Williams. But it is the chance to see Air Force One that she is especially excited about it. The presidential fleet includes two identical jets, and whichever one the president is aboard is given the signal name Air Force One. The current Boeing 747s have been in use for nearly three decades. The 4,000 sq/ft (1,220 sq/m) aircraft features three floors, armoured windows, medical offices and a kitchen that can feed 100 people at a time. A new version is expected to come into service in 2024. \"It is a once-in-a-lifetime type of thing. It is going to be great,\" says Mrs Williams. \"I've been coming over here since I was nine years old,\" says daughter Vanessa Hale, who has brought her own two-year-old girl Ricci-Leigh. \"It is amazing, it is in my blood. \"Now I've got a two-year-old and she is amazed by everything. I love it. \"I am really looking forward to seeing Air Force One come in and sitting on the base.  \"It will be the first time I remember seeing it up close and personal. I've waited years for this.\" But Mrs Williams and family have only come from just over the border in Cambridgeshire. Paul Darlow has travelled up all the way from Devon and has met up with his parents John and Janet Darlow, who have joined him at Mildenhall from Wiltshire. For them too, the interest is more in the aircraft than the president himself. \"It keeps my husband happy and he loves the aircraft,\" says Mrs Darlow. \"We come together to sit read and watch the aircraft. \"It is a once-in-a-lifetime to see Air Force One and the other aircraft that go with it.\" As for the senior Mr Darlow, there is a tinge of disappointment about the Biden visit. \"I would prefer to have seen his helicopter,\" he says, \"but it doesn't sound like that is going to happen. \"We are hopefully going to see the flying command post that flies with him [Joe Biden].  \"For me, that will be the star of the arrivals. There will probably some other VIP aircraft flying too.\" While it will not be Mr Darlow's first experience of Air Force One and its aerial entourage - he has seen them before at Fairford, Gloucestershire - this will be the first time \"in recent years\". \"It is a bit special,\" he says. \"I grew up just after the war and we were surrounded by military bases and there was aircraft everywhere, and I suppose [my interest] just grew from there. \"I really like the US Navy stuff that lands on carriers. I don't think I could pick out a favourite aircraft.\" As for Mr Darlow (junior), he has come for what he describes as \"a free air show without all the crowds and the hassle\". \"I had nothing on, the sun is shining and its a unique opportunity to see some unusual planes,\" he says.  \"The jumbo [Air Force One] is a nice aircraft but it is the stuff that accompanies him that is more interesting, such as the command post, like my dad says. \"I was taken with plane spotting when I was growing up. We used to do a lot of air shows. It is nice to pick it up again with my parents. Mildenhall is a wonderful place.\" What does the presidential visit mean for the town itself? \"We are very excited here in Mildenhall,\" says the mayor of Mildenhall Jane Busuttil. \"There's a huge buzz in the town about receiving the president of the United States and the First Lady, Dr Jill Biden. \"There's real excitement to have the president visit and perhaps stop over possibly on his way over to Newquay for the G7 Summit. \"It is a great opportunity for the president to meet the personnel and their families.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "title": "Air India: Can the national carrier finally find a buyer?",
            "text": "The Indian government's announcement that it will sell its entire stake in its national carrier, Air India, is being seen as a much more exciting proposition for potential buyers. A document, inviting expressions of interest, was released on Monday.  It says that any bidder would have to take on around $3.2bn (\u00a32.4bn) of debt along with other liabilities. The announcement comes more than a year after a bid to sell a controlling stake in the airline did not attract buyers.  The divestment of Air India has been a key agenda of the Indian government, which has been trying to offload loss-making companies and improve its balance sheet in the face of the slowest economic growth in a decade. Air India sale fails to attract buyers For years, Air India has blamed high aviation fuel prices, high airport usage charges, competition from low-cost carriers, weakening of the rupee, as well as a high interest burden for its poor financial performance. Most significantly, it is offering a 100% stake in the airline. In 2018, it only offered potential buyers a 76% stake in the business. This was seen as a factor that put off potential buyers at the time. \"This is a very welcome change from last time to entice private players to bid for the carrier,\" Jitendra Bhargava, former Executive Director of Air India and author of the book, The Descent of Air India, told the BBC's Nikhil Inamdar.  Air India has 146 aircraft and owns 56% of its total fleet. It is also known to have lucrative international and domestic landing and parking slots. But the carrier has continuously lost market share over the last decade as it saw growing competition from low-cost rivals. The airline has a large debt overhang, with liabilities exceeding over $8bn.  But bidders will be expected to take on debt only to the tune of $3.26 billion according to the new terms. It is not yet clear what the government will do with the remaining debt. \"This could be a challenge because it is a very large portion of the debt to be taken care of when you consider that they have repayment schedules over eight to 10 years on around 70 aircraft,\" said Mahantesh Sabarad, head of Retail Research at SBICAP Securities. \"Buyers will also need to infuse substantial funds into the airline, so we expect the start-up costs for anyone getting into this to be high.\"  Experts are also concerned that restructuring Air India's employee base of 14,000 plus people could be a challenge.  \"I am concerned that the government hasn't reached out substantively to its critics, which includes employee unions and politicians,\" Mr Bhargava said.  The Economic Times newspaper has already reported that some of the employee unions are holding a meeting in Delhi later today to discuss the move. 1932:  Tata Sons, helmed by business tycoon JRD Tata, launches Tata Airlines 1946: It becomes a public company and is renamed Air India 1948: The government of India acquires a 49% stake in the carrier 1953: The government nationalises Air India   2007: Air India merges with Indian Airlines, a government-owned airline which only operated domestic routes 2007-08: Air India posts a net loss of 334mn rupees ($4.6mn; \u00a33.5mn) 2018: An attempt to sell a 76% stake in the airline attracts no bidders 2019: Air India posts a net loss of 12.8bn rupees, its highest since the merger in 2007",

            "text": "Protesters who broke into Stansted Airport to stop a plane deporting people to Africa have begun an appeal to challenge their convictions. The \"Stansted 15\" were convicted under counter-terrorism legislation on 10 December 2018. The protesters cut through the perimeter fence and locked themselves together around a Boeing 767 jet. The Court of Appeal was told laws used to convict them were intended to deal with terrorism, not demonstrators. The protesters all pleaded not guilty, but were convicted of the intentional disruption of services at an aerodrome in March 2017 under the Aviation and Maritime Security Act (Amsa) 1990. The jet they targeted had been chartered by the Home Office to transport people from UK detention centres for repatriation to Africa. In February 2019 three were given suspended jail sentences, and the other 12 were handed community orders. At the beginning of the appeal hearing in London, lawyers for the activists argued the legislation used to convict the 15 is rarely used and not intended for this type of case. The High Court heard the demonstrators' lawyers were prevented from arguing their actions were necessary to the jury by the judge at the trial, because they were not trying to prevent an immediate domestic crime. However, they said stopping the plane was necessary to prevent the deportation of people at risk of harm in their destination countries, including LGBT people believed to be on board. Lead counsel for the protesters, Clare Montgomery QC, told the court each defendant believed there was \"an immediate threat\" and their actions were \"effectively the last opportunity that was available to anyone in this country\". Documents presented to the court by the group's barristers stated that the Amsa legislation was there to deal with \"unlawful violence of the utmost seriousness\" such as terrorism, not demonstrators. Lawyers for the group also argued that the Attorney General - who is required to sign off on the use of this legislation - should not have granted consent for the law to be used in this case, that the Crown Court judge, Judge Christopher Morgan, made errors in summing up the case, and there were errors in directions given to the jury. In their written argument, barristers representing the Crown said the convictions were safe and the trial judge was correct. They said the fact the protesters had planned their action weeks in advance was not consistent with a defence of necessity, and that there are strict limits on when that can be used. The appeal hearing is expected to last three days. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. If you have a story suggestion email eastofenglandnews@bbc.co.uk",

American Airlines said flight AAL38 with 129 passengers on board returned to Miami where police were waiting.  They escorted a woman in her 40s off the plane, reports say. She has been placed on a list of people barred from flying with American Airlines, pending further investigation, the airline said. The Wednesday flight turned around about an hour into its journey, according to tracking service FlightAware. The woman was sitting in first class, another passenger Steve Freeman told Miami's Local 10 news.  \"There was a lot of drinking involved and I was nervous. She sat behind us in first class,\" he said. \"I could see the writing on the wall - they gave her a lot of warnings, so we were kind of ready for it.\" Passengers on the flight to London's Heathrow Airport were re-booked on to another flight for Thursday. \"Everyone was shocked,\" one passenger told CBS station WFOR-TV after getting off the Wednesday flight. Another passenger said she was disappointed. \"They wouldn't really say anything, and I don't believe they told the flight attendants anything either, because they said that all they could say was there was an extreme incident with a passenger and they had to turn around,\" she told the station. Airlines reported nearly 6,000 incidents involving unruly passengers last year and 151 in the first two weeks of this year, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Most of them involved passengers who refused to wear masks.",

            "text": "Australian airline Qantas has announced that it will switch its domestic fleet of planes to Airbus from Boeing. The deal is a major win for the European plane maker and a blow to its US-based arch-rival. The company also said that it expects to make a loss of more than A$1.1bn (\u00a3590m; $788m) in the first half of its financial year. Like the rest of the global aviation industry, Qantas has been hit hard by months of coronavirus lockdowns. \"This has been one of the worst halves of the entire pandemic, where most states had their borders closed and the majority of Australians were in lockdown. Domestically, our capacity fell to around 30 per cent of pre-Covid levels for several months,\" Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said in a statement. \"We have significantly reduced our cost base which improves our ability to recover,\" he added. The company also said it had boosted its coffers by selling land near Sydney Airport for $574m. The airline said demand for domestic flights slowed in late November as the Omicron variant of Covid-19 emerged, although the situation was now starting to improve. It also expects competition in the domestic travel market to intensify in the second half of the financial year as Australia's state borders open. Looking to the future, the company announced that it had agreed to buy 40 Airbus jets, with the option to purchase another 94 aircraft. \"This is a long-term renewal plan with deliveries and payments spread over the next decade and beyond, but the similarly long lead time for aircraft orders means we need to make these decisions now,\" Mr Joyce said. The deal is subject to approval by the company's board, which is expected by June next year after negotiations with pilots. Deliveries of the new planes are due to start in mid-2023 and continue over the 10 years to replace the airline's ageing fleet of Boeing jets. Qantas also said that the new planes would lower its carbon emissions. The announcement by Qantas caps a good week for Airbus after Singapore Airlines on Wednesday signed a provisional deal to buy seven A350 freighters.",

            "title": "Climate change could make flights longer and bumpier",
            "text": "As if flying wasn't already enough of a chore, there's an increasing number of studies showing climate change might make it worse.  Changes to the jet stream could make flights longer and more turbulent. And higher temperatures could affect the maximum takeoff weight, meaning more weight restrictions and even flight cancellations.   The problems could have an effect on the profits of airlines, which are already operating on slim margins.   Research from Reading University has found that flights could become lengthier and more turbulent because of climate change.  Climate change will make the jet stream stronger, and while tailwinds will help flights in one direction, headwinds will slow them down on the return leg.  This effect doesn't cancel itself out, and in fact on the transatlantic route, the costs could amount to $22m (\u00a317m) in additional fuel every year. The same researchers found that a more powerful and unpredictable jet stream could increase the number of incidents of severe turbulence by 149%.  This could increase the risk of injury and add to an airline's insurance costs.   Boeing says its planes can be equipped to counter the effects of turbulence as well as to avoid it altogether.  But flying around turbulence could lengthen the flight and add to fuel costs.    A study in July looked at five different commonly-used planes, and found that 10-30% of flights could require some weight restriction by the middle of the century due to rising temperatures.  That could mean a reduction in passengers and cargo of between 0.5-2%. The problem is that a wing's lift is directly related to the density of the air flowing past it: the denser the air, the greater the lift.  In extreme heat, the air becomes less dense, making take-off harder.  Engines are affected too, because they create less thrust.  As a result, a plane might have a lower maximum take-off weight, or it might need more space on a runway to get airborne.  For most major passenger jets, the maximum operating temperature is around the 49C, give or take a few degrees depending on the aircraft.  At the moment, those temperatures are mercifully rare. Still, major airlines were forced to delay or cancel dozens of flights out of Las Vegas and Phoenix airports in June due to a heat wave. The concern is that climate change will make it more common.  While deserts are obviously the most affected, the study's author Ethan Coffel says some Asian airports - Bangkok and Hong Kong, for example - could see a substantial fraction of long-haul flights requiring some takeoff weight restriction during the hottest parts of the day. Mr Coffel thinks the problem could be a \"non-trivial\" addition to an airline's costs, which will come in the form of reduced payloads.  This is an industry with slim profit margins and on any given flight the difference between making a profit or a loss might boil down to just a few passengers. It's why airlines overbook flights.  This year, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) expects the airline industry globally to make a profit margin of 4.1% and to keep $7.54 for each passenger, but this is a good year and those figures are much lower outside the lucrative US market.  Some industry-watchers feel the research is extremely speculative, because it deals with conditions that are several decades away.  \"It could be an issue very long term, but you've got to expect aircraft performance will improve, or maybe people will fly less,\" said FlightGlobal's Greg Waldron.  Canadian manufacturer Bombardier says airlines that operate in very hot cities tend to get around the problem by scheduling flights in the evening or early in the morning to operate in lower temperatures.  Boeing says its customers can order a \"high and hot\" package, which improves performance with slightly more thrust and slightly larger control devices on the wing.  But Ethan Coffel notes that those solutions aren't free.  \"There is always an opportunity cost - performance would have been better without climate change,\" he said.  At the other end of the spectrum, flights are sometimes cancelled due to cold weather too.  For example, more than 6,000 flights were cancelled in the US because of a storm in March, mostly due to icy conditions on the runway.  So if the climate continues to get warmer, would a few flights cancellations in Phoenix be balanced out by fewer cancellations in Toronto because of less freezing weather?  \"It is possible that cold weather impacts could be reduced - that would be a useful future research area,\" said Ethan Coffel.

            "title": "Trudeau defends the number of planes used by his campaign",
            "text": "Liberal leader Justin Trudeau is facing criticism over his campaign's use of two planes.  None of the other parties in this election is using more than one plane as their leaders campaign across Canada's vast territory.  The Conservatives accused Mr Trudeau of being \"hypocritical\" on environmental issues for using two planes - already a carbon-intensive mode of transport.  The Liberals say they bought carbon offsets for their tour emissions.  The Conservatives confirmed that they are not offsetting the emissions produced by the leader's tour and its single plane.  Other major parties - the NDP, the Liberals, the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, the Greens - all say they are or will use carbon offsets.  On Thursday, Mr Trudeau accused the Conservatives of trying to deflect from their own record on climate issues.  \"What we're seeing here from the Conservatives is a classic and desperate attempt to distract that they have zero respect\u00a0for the environment,\" he told journalists in Montreal.  The reveal of the two Liberal planes was part of a fiery exchange during the first French-language election debate on Wednesday night.  Mr Scheer accused the Liberal leader of being a \"fake environmentalist\". \"There is only one leader on stage that has two campaign planes - one for him and the media and one for his costumes and canoes,\" he said, taking a swipe at Mr Trudeau for the two campaign planes - and for paddling up to a recent campaign event in a canoe. The Conservatives then released the details of the two Liberal campaign planes to the media.  There is an official branded Boeing campaign plane for Mr Trudeau, his staff, and journalists, and a second Boeing aircraft the party uses to ferry cargo.  Carbon offsetting allows people to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flights or other emission producing activities.  The money is then invested in environmental projects - such as planting trees or installing solar panels - aimed at reducing the greenhouse gases in the air by the same amount. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour. Mr Trudeau's Liberals say they have partnered with Less Emissions, which provides carbon offsets for flight related emissions, for the campaign.  The NDP, which has one plane, said it is trying to limit the campaign's carbon footprint, and are planning to offset emissions. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois campaigns exclusively in one province and so travels by bus. The party is partnering with a Quebec-based carbon offset programme.  The Green Party says it does purchase carbon offsets and tries to limit campaign travel. Leader Elizabeth May crosses the country by train  \"as much as possible\" and flies commercial only as needed, a spokeswoman said.  Climate change has become a central issue in this federal election campaign, and in opinion surveys it frequently comes up a core issue for many voters who will be going to the polls on 21 October.  The Liberals have promised that they will exceed Canada's 2030 emissions goals - despite not currently being on track to meet the pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by that year.  They have also committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 -  which would mean any emissions would be entirely offset by other actions - if re-elected.  The Conservatives have said they would immediately repeal the price on carbon Mr Trudeau's Liberal government imposed on four provinces, and instead focus on funding and exporting green technology innovation.

            "text": "Boeing's boss Dennis Muilenburg will not take a bonus this year following two crashes involving the firm's 737 Max plane which killed 346 people. Boeing's chairman David Calhoun said Mr Muilenburg had made the suggestion. Mr Muilenburg recently faced US lawmakers who accused the firm of building \"flying coffins\" and engaging in a \"pattern of deliberate concealment\". But Mr Calhoun said Mr Muilenburg \"has done everything right\". Mr Calhoun, who took over as chairman after Mr Muilenburg was stripped of the role last month, told CNBC that the chief executive retained the confidence of Boeing's board.  For 2018, Mr Muilenburg's pay included a $13m (\u00a310.1m) bonus on top of his $1.7m salary. His total pay package rose 27% from 2017. Last October, a Boeing 737 Max operated by Lion Air crashed, killing all 189 people on board. Five months later an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed, killing 157 people, after which the entire 737 Max fleet was grounded. At last week's hearing with US senators, families of people who died in the crash told the BBC that they felt Mr Muilenburg was evasive and should resign. \"I want him to say unequivocally that he takes responsibility for the deaths of 346 people because the crashes were preventable,\" said Paul Njoroge, who lost five family members in the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Adnaan Stumo, whose sister Samya died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, said Mr Muilenburg should step down \"and go to jail\". Senators also criticised the regulatory process, saying there was excessive \"cosiness\" between the firm and safety officials at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Mr Muilenburg told the hearing that the firm supported \"strong oversight\" but declined to support increasing the authority of the FAA, which has been criticised for delegating too much of its oversight to company officials. Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, Mr Calhoun said that the company did not have any plans to change the name of the 737 Max. Since the grounding of the 737 Max fleet in March, Boeing has said it is fixing the model's software and has overhauled its review procedures. In April, Boeing reduced production of the plane by almost a fifth. Mr Calhoun said the company was not expecting to make any further production cuts.  Separately, the head of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said regulators should co-operate in assessing the airworthiness of the 737 Max rather than pursuing their own approval processes. Alexandre de Juniac told Reuters that taking an individual approach was \"a big, big, big mistake\". \"We have built the safety of this industry on the single certification decision and the mutual recognition and it has worked very well.\"",

The company said it had concerns over security in Venezuela because of increasing criminal violence and political uncertainty.   It joins dozens of airlines who have taken similar action. Iata, the trade body for the world's airlines, says Venezuela is becoming increasingly isolated.  Peter Cerd\u00e1, vice-president of Iata, said last week: \"The situation has become increasingly difficult, most of Iata's members have left Venezuela. There are only six or seven carriers left operating a very low flight frequency. \"Venezuela is becoming disconnected, it's practically disconnected from the rest of the world, above all by air, and we can't see any solution in the short term.\"  Avianca suspends flights to Venezuela  Crisis hit Venezuelans leave for Brazil  Since 2003 Venezuela has operated a series of currency exchange controls managed by the government.  Airline companies have been attempting for years to change the local bolivar currency it receives when it sells tickets in Venezuela into dollars. But the government strictly controls the amount of foreign currency it allows onto the market.  Mr Cerd\u00e1 said passenger traffic in Venezuela had dropped by 75% in the last four years.  Most of the airlines that have left reported disputes with the Venezuelan government over unpaid contracts and worries over crew safety. In August the president of the Panamanian airline Copa, Pedro Heilbron, told AFP that the company would continue to operate in Venezuela despite the difficulties.  \"We are becoming practically the only operator in the market but our intention is not to leave, not to abandon the market in Venezuela.\"  He said Copa crews would not stay the night in Venezuelan cities.  The United States airlines United and Delta, and the Colombian airline Avianca, suspended flights to Venezuela this year.  The German airline Lufthansa left in 2016.  Air Canada, Aeromexico, Alitalia, Lan, Tam, and Gol left between 2014 and 2015. ",

            "text": "The UK's busiest airport has warned the country risks falling behind others in making aviation greener. Heathrow Airport has called for the government to help make sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) more commercially viable in the UK. SAF cuts the amount of carbon emissions released during air travel but is currently several times more expensive to produce than traditional fuel. The government has said it wants five SAF plants under construction by 2025. SAF is produced from sustainable sources such as agricultural waste and used cooking oil. It is claimed to reduce carbon emissions by up to 70%. Heathrow runs a scheme which provides SAF to airlines and covers up to half the extra cost through a \u00a338m fund. However, last year only 0.5% of the fuel bought at the airport was through the initiative. It announced on Tuesday that it aims to triple its SAF usage this year, raising the figure to 1.5%. But the major airport fears a tax credit scheme in the US designed to lure investors in SAF production has put the UK at risk of missing out. Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye called for more government support to encourage greater SAF use. \"It's about economic opportunity, creating jobs here in the UK and securing the country's future energy supplies,\" Mr Holland-Kaye said. He added that although Heathrow had \"led the way on decarbonising aviation\" with its green aviation fuel scheme, the SAF used by the airport was \"currently all imported\". \"If Britain really wants to compete with the scale of ambition and the credible action seen from the US and Europe, supportive government policy is needed and it is needed now,\" he said. The government has already proposed airlines operating in the UK must ensure SAF makes up at least 10% of their fuel by 2030. It has also invested in the development of SAF plants. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"The UK's sustainable aviation fuels programme is one of the most comprehensive in the world. \"Our \u00a3165m Advanced Fuel Fund is kickstarting production, with five projects already chosen to receive funding, and we are working at pace to put our mandate policy into law.\"  Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

            "text": "Boeing has completed development of a software update for its 737 Max plane which was grounded following two fatal crashes within five months. The US firm announced that it had flown the 737 Max with the updated software on 207 flights. It added it would provide data to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on how pilots interact with controls and displays in different scenarios. The FAA expects Boeing to submit the upgrade for certification next week. An Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed in March, killing all 157 people on board. It followed the Lion Air disaster in Indonesia in October, in which 189 people died. Both crashes were linked to the Boeing 737 Max's Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System - a new feature on the aircraft which was designed to improve the handling of the plane and to stop it pitching up at too high an angle.   Boeing said that once information on how pilots work with the upgraded system is submitted to the FAA, it will work with the regulator to schedule a certification test flight and submit final certification documentation. The company also said it had completed associated simulator testing on the upgraded system and had developed training and education materials that are now being reviewed by the FAA, global regulators and its airline customers.  The FAA said earlier this week that it would hold a meeting on 23 May with air regulators from around the world to provide an update on reviews of Boeing's software fix and new pilot training. Aviation safety analyst Todd Curtis told the BBC that the US regulator was not the only one that Boeing had to satisfy. \"You also have other national authorities in Canada and the United Kingdom and in Europe who have said they would like to have their own tests and their own evaluation before certifying this aircraft for flight,\" he said. \"It's unclear whether or not there will be approval, let's say from Canada, to have this aircraft fly, which could directly affect US carriers, since many routes - even domestic US routes - overfly Canadian airspace.   \"If the authorities there don't certify the 737 Max, they'll have to avoid that airspace.\" Pilots are expected to undergo extra training on the new system once it receives certification. Mr Curtis said it would take a lot to convince them and other flight crew members that the aircraft was safe. \"They probably will have a fairly high bar to be satisfied before they'll give the seal of approval, as it were, that the aircraft is safe to fly,\" he said.",

            "title": "Belarus plane arrest - is it a first?",
            "text": "The forced diversion of a Ryanair passenger plane to Belarus's capital Minsk on Sunday, and the arrest of a dissident journalist on board, have caused outrage elsewhere in Europe. The civilian aircraft was flying from Greece to Lithuania, passing through Belarus's airspace, when Belarus sent a fighter jet to intercept it, claiming there was a bomb threat. The pilots of the Ryanair flight were obliged to follow the instructions of the military plane. The events have been condemned by the EU and the US. But has a similar intercept happened before? Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Western countries of hypocrisy, saying (in Russian) that nations \"had reacted differently to similar events which took place in other countries earlier\". She referred particularly to an incident eight years ago involving the plane of Bolivia's then-President Evo Morales. Here's a look back at previous incidents where planes may - or may not - have been forced to land. In July 2013 Evo Morales was flying back to Bolivia from a summit in Moscow, when his jet had to divert to Vienna airport in Austria after several other European countries apparently refused it permission to enter their airspace. Bolivia said that there had been a \"huge lie\" that US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden - at that time holed up in a Moscow airport - was on board the presidential aircraft.  France later apologised to the Bolivian government for the \"late confirmation of permission\" to enter French airspace, blaming \"conflicting information\". However, the analogy to Sunday's incident in Belarus is not perfect, as Mr Morales's plane was not intercepted by fighter jets and forced to land - it was not granted permission to enter the other countries' airspace in the first place. The Bolivian president was also travelling on a state aircraft rather than a commercial, civilian passenger plane. The UN's agency for civil aviation, ICAO, said it was strongly concerned about an \"apparent forced landing\" in the Belarus incident which could be \"in contravention of the Chicago Convention\" setting out the rules on accessing airspace and aircraft safety. The 1944 Chicago convention applies to civilian planes, such as the Ryanair flight, but not to state aircraft such as presidential or military planes. Abdolmalek Rigi, head of Jundullah, a violent Sunni rebel group, was arrested by Iran in February 2010. The official Irna news agency later said he had been flying to an Arab country via Pakistan before his arrest. \"His plane was ordered to land and then he was arrested after the plane was searched,\" Iranian lawmaker Mohammed Dehgan was quoted by news agency AFP as saying. Other reports from the time said that Rigi was on board a commercial flight from Dubai to Kyrgyzstan which landed in Iran, where he was arrested. But there were conflicting reports - particularly in US media - suggesting Pakistan had offered assistance to bring Rigi into custody. The BBC has not independently verified how Rigi came to be in Iranian custody and Iran's claims that its jets forced a commercial airliner to land in Iran may not be correct. The militant leader was executed in June 2010. In October 1985 an Egyptian plane carrying suspected Palestinian militants was intercepted by US fighter jets and forced to land at a US base in Italy. The Italian cruise liner Achille Lauro had been hijacked in the Mediterranean with hundreds of people on board, and an elderly American Jewish passenger was killed. The four militants from the Palestinian Liberation Front initially escaped after allowing the Achille Lauro to dock in Egypt. They attempted to flee Egypt on board an airliner chartered from Egyptair, which was taking them to Tunis. The plane was intercepted by F-16 jets in international airspace over the Mediterranean, according to the Los Angeles Times report at the time, and escorted to the US base of Sigonella in Sicily. The four hijackers were tried and sentenced to long jail terms in Italy. On 22 October 1956 five leaders of the Algerian independence movement, the FLN, were on a civilian flight from Rabat in Morocco to Tunis, reports the BBC's Ahmed Rouaba. They were due to take part in a conference on the future of the Maghreb region hosted by then Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba. Algeria was a French colony at the time and the French secret service sent fighter jets to intercept the passenger plane, forcing it to land in Algeria. The events sparked anger in Morocco and Tunisia. The five arrested included Ahmed Ben Bella, who went on to be Algeria's first president after it gained independence from France. He died in 2012 aged 95.",

            "text": "Boeing and Bombardier traded verbal blows on Monday over claims by the US planemaker that the Canadian company receives massive subsidies. The two sides appeared before the US International Trade Commission (ITC) in the latest round of their bitter row. Boeing accused Bombardier of harming sales of its 737 aircraft and urged the ITC to support tariffs on its rival. But Bombardier, which makes wings in Belfast, said Boeing makes \"money hand over fist\" from the 737. Boeing claims Bombardier's new C-Series aircraft is being sold in the US below cost because of Canadian subsidies. The US company won the first round of the fight in October when the US Commerce Department ordered that tariffs of up to 300% should be imposed on the C-Series. The ITC will decide if the tariffs should be made permanent, which could effectively shut off the US market to the C-Series. In opening remarks to the ITC hearing, Bombardier representative Peter Lichtenbaum said: \"Boeing is making money hand over fist. And with a backlog of 737 orders years into the future, there are no signs of difficulty on the horizon.\" Boeing countered that it had already been \"established beyond question that Bombardier has taken billions of dollars in illegal government subsidies to prop up its C-Series programme. The C-Series would not even exist at this point but for those subsidies\". Canada's ambassador to the US, David MacNaughton, warned that a ruling in favour of Boeing would not be the end of the dispute. He told the ITC panel that backing Boeing risked a possible violation of World Trade Organization rules. \"Boeing's assertion that future imports from Canada threaten to cause material injury is necessarily based on just the type of speculation and conjecture that is prohibited under both US and international law,\" he said. Canada earlier this month scrapped plans to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets, underlining Ottawa's anger over the trade challenge. The dispute is also being closely watched by the UK government, which fears any impact on C-Series sales will threaten jobs. The dispute stems from a 2016 sale of 75 C-Series jets to Delta Air Lines. Boeing claims Delta paid $20m per plane, well below an estimated cost of $33m and what Bombardier charges in Canada.  Earlier this year, European planemaker Airbus took a controlling stake in the C-Series programme, and will begin production in Alabama. This will increase the US content of the aircraft, and generate hundreds of jobs.",

            "title": "Iran plane crash: What's the evidence a missile shot down the Ukrainian plane?",
            "text": "Western countries say they have evidence that an Iranian missile shot down a Ukrainian plane close to Tehran airport on Wednesday.  Iran has denied any involvement, and say the plane was not hit by a missile. So what's the evidence that an Iranian missile was to blame? Video footage shared on Iranian social media accounts appears to show the moment of impact on Ukrainian International Airlines flight PS752.  The images show a flash followed by a loud bang. The plane then continues to fly, turning back in the direction of Tehran airport, then crashing into the ground in a ball of flame. BBC Monitoring has indentified the location from where the video was shot to Parand, a residential area west of Tehran.  It's about 30km (18miles) from Imam Khomeini International Airport, where the aircraft began its journey.   Rows of housing blocks, a construction site and a storage tank, which all appear in the video, match a Google Earth image of the location, according to BBC Monitoring. There are now many photos of the plane wreckage available on media sites.  These photos, and the subsequent detailed examination of the wreckage itself, will hold vital clues such as burn marks indicating a fire, explosive residue which could point to a bomb on board or possible shrapnel damage from a missile.  An anti-aircraft missile is generally designed to detonate at a distance from the target, sending shrapnel towards it, inflicting maximum damage.   Puncture holes pointing inwards could indicate an explosion or damage from outside the aircraft.  And detailed analysis of the size and shape of any holes could give an indication of the type of missile used. At this stage, it's difficult to verify many of the images which are being shared which - it's claimed - show damage consistent with a missile attack. Some show the nose of a missile from the Russian-made Tor missile system.  These photos have not been independently verified yet and we don't know where or when they were taken, because there are no identifiable landmarks.   US intelligence sources say two missiles were fired, according to US media.  Questions have been raised about why the nose of the missile in these photos appears to be intact. However, an expert we've spoken to explains that it's not surprising to see the nose - which contains its guidance system and does not itself impact the target - intact and at a distance from the crash site.  There are reports from inside Iran that the crash site has already been bulldozed and the wreckage cleared away.  Elizabeth Palmer of CBS news reported that \"virtually all pieces\" of the plane had been removed by Thursday. This makes the digital evidence gathered so far a vital element in determining what actually happened to the aircraft. There are two so-called \"black boxes\". The flight data recorder captures everything going on with the plane's systems. This will be crucial in revealing if there were any internal malfunctions.   The voice recorder is designed to contain two hours of audio from the cockpit, and may hold vital clues, as it records what the flight crew were saying at the time. Iranian officials say it could take up to two months to download data from the black boxes.  It takes a long time to investigate because there's a huge amount of data, says aviation expert Julian Bray.  However, he also says that skilled analysts may be able to get an initial idea from the data within a couple of weeks. There's a limit to what the black boxes can reveal if a bomb or missile destroys the aircraft. They could simply stop working, although the voice recorder might pick up a sound wave just beforehand. Some investigations can last years. A probe into the crash of an Ethiopian plane off Beirut in 2010 took two years to complete, even though the black boxes were sent to France, which has some of the world's top investigators. The Iranian military would have been on very high alert just hours after the launch of Iranian missiles at US targets in Iraq, in anticipation of possible retaliatory strikes by the US. The area where the plane came down was not only close to the capital, Tehran, but also a military base of the Iran's Revolutionary Guards. There are however multiple precautions that should have been in place to prevent a civilian airliner being targeted in error. The radar system used by the missile operators is designed to pick up identifying signals from all civilian aircraft. \"Flight PS752 was transmitting a transponder code showing its civilian identity registration, position and altitude,\" says Justin Bronk, a Research Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, \"and the missile radar operator should have been able to see that information.\"  If this does prove to be a missile strike on a passenger plane, it would not be unprecedented. In 2014, a Russian-made missile hit a Malaysian civilian airliner over Ukraine, killing 298 people. An Iranian aircraft was shot down in error in 1988 by a US navy warship, the USS Vincennes, killing 290 people. In 1983, a Soviet fighter jet took down a Korean passenger plane after it strayed into Soviet airspace. All 269 people on board died.

            "text": "A Boeing whistleblower has claimed that passengers on its 787 Dreamliner could be left without oxygen if the cabin were to suffer a sudden decompression. John Barnett says tests suggest up to a quarter of the oxygen systems could be faulty and might not work when needed. He also claimed faulty parts were deliberately fitted to planes on the production line at one Boeing factory. Boeing denies his accusations and says all its aircraft are built to the highest levels of safety and quality.  The firm has come under intense scrutiny in the wake of two catastrophic accidents involving another one of its planes, the 737 Max - the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March and Lion Air disaster in Indonesia last year. Mr Barnett, a former quality control engineer, worked for Boeing for 32 years, until his retirement on health grounds in March 2017.  From 2010 he was employed as a quality manager at Boeing's factory in North Charleston, South Carolina. This plant is one of two that are involved in building the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art modern airliner used widely on long-haul routes around the world. Despite early teething problems following its entry into service the aircraft has proved a hit with airlines, and a useful source of profits for the company. But according to Mr Barnett, 57, the rush to get new aircraft off the production line meant that the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised. The company denies this and insists that \"safety, quality and integrity are at the core of Boeing's values\".  In 2016, he tells the BBC, he uncovered problems with emergency oxygen systems. These are supposed to keep passengers and crew alive if the cabin pressurisation fails for any reason at altitude. Breathing masks are meant to drop down from the ceiling, which then supply oxygen from a gas cylinder.  Without such systems, the occupants of a plane would rapidly be incapacitated. At 35,000ft, (10,600m) they would be unconscious in less than a minute. At 40,000ft, it could happen within 20 seconds. Brain damage and even death could follow.  Although sudden decompression events are rare, they do happen. In April 2018, for example, a window blew out of a Southwest Airlines aircraft, after being hit by debris from a damaged engine. One passenger sitting beside the window suffered serious injuries and later died as a result - but others were able to draw on the emergency oxygen supplies and survived unharmed.  Mr Barnett says that when he was decommissioning systems which had suffered minor cosmetic damage, he found that some of the oxygen bottles were not discharging when they were meant to. He subsequently arranged for a controlled test to be carried out by Boeing's own research and development unit. This test, which used oxygen systems that were \"straight out of stock\" and undamaged, was designed to mimic the way in which they would be deployed aboard an aircraft, using exactly the same electric current as a trigger. He says 300 systems were tested - and 75 of them did not deploy properly, a failure rate of 25%. Mr Barnett says his attempts to have the matter looked at further were stonewalled by Boeing managers.  In 2017, he complained to the US regulator, the FAA, that no action had been taken to address the problem. The FAA, however, said it could not substantiate that claim, because Boeing had indicated it was working on the issue at the time.  Boeing itself rejects Mr Barnett's assertions. It does concede that in 2017 it \"identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly. We removed those bottles from production so that no defective bottles were placed on airplanes, and we addressed the matter with our supplier\". But it also states that \"every passenger oxygen system installed on our airplanes is tested multiple times before delivery to ensure it is functioning properly, and must pass those tests to remain on the airplane.\" \"The system is also tested at regular intervals once the airplane enters service,\" it says.  This is not the only allegation levelled at Boeing regarding the South Carolina plant, however. Mr Barnett also says that Boeing failed to follow its own procedures, intended to track parts through the assembly process, allowing a number of defective items to be \"lost\".  He claims that under-pressure workers even fitted sub-standard parts from scrap bins to aircraft on the production line, in at least one case with the knowledge of a senior manager. He says this was done to save time, because \"Boeing South Carolina is strictly driven by schedule and cost\". On the matter of parts being lost, in early 2017 a review by the Federal Aviation Administration upheld Mr Barnett's concerns, establishing that the location of at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts was unknown, and that they were considered lost. Boeing was ordered to take remedial action. Since then, the company says, it has \"fully resolved the FAA's findings with regard to part traceability, and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence\". It has made no further comment about the possibility of non-conforming parts making it on to completed aircraft - although insiders at the North Charleston plant insist it could not happen. Mr Barnett is currently taking legal action against Boeing, which he accuses of denigrating his character and hampering his career because of the issues he pointed out, ultimately leading to his retirement. The company's response is that he had long-standing plans to retire, and did so voluntarily. It says \"Boeing has in no way negatively impacted Mr Barnett's ability to continue in whatever chosen profession he so wishes\". The company says it offers its employees a number of channels for raising concerns and complaints, and has rigorous processes in place to protect them and make sure the issues they draw attention to are considered. It says: \"We encourage and expect our employees to raise concerns and when they do, we thoroughly investigate and fully resolve them.\"  But Mr Barnett is not the only Boeing employee to have raised concerns about Boeing's manufacturing processes. Earlier this year, for example, it emerged that following the Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crash, four current or former employees contacted an FAA hotline to report potential issues. Mr Barnett believes that the concerns he has highlighted reflect a corporate culture that is \"all about speed, cost-cutting and bean count (jobs sold)\". He claims managers are \"not concerned about safety, just meeting schedule\". That's a view which has support from another former engineer, Adam Dickson, who was involved with the development of the 737 Max at Boeing's Renton factory in Washington state. He tells the BBC there was \"a drive to keep the aeroplanes moving through the factory. There were often pressures to keep production levels up.  \"My team constantly fought the factory on processes and quality. And our senior managers were no help.\" In congressional hearings in October, Democratic congressman Albio Sires quoted from an email sent by a senior manager on the 737 Max production line. In it, the manager complained about workers being \"exhausted\" from having to work at a very high pace for an extended period. He said that schedule pressure was \"creating a culture where employees are either deliberately or unconsciously circumventing established processes\", adversely affecting quality.  For the first time in his life, the email's author said, he was hesitant about allowing his family aboard a Boeing aircraft.  Boeing says that together with the FAA, it implements a \"rigorous inspection process\" to ensure its aircraft are safe, and that all of them go through \"multiple safety and test flights\" as well as extensive inspections before they are allowed to leave the factory. Boeing recently commissioned an independent review of its safety processes, which it says \"found rigorous enforcement of, and compliance with, both the FAA's aircraft certification standards and Boeing's aircraft design and engineering requirements.\" It said that the review had \"established that the design and development of the [737] Max was done in line with the procedures and processes that have consistently produced safe airplanes.\"  Nevertheless, as a result of that review, in late September the company announced a number of changes to its safety structures. They include the creation of a new \"product and services safety organization\".  It will be charged with reviewing all aspects of product safety \"including investigating cases of undue pressure and anonymous product and safety concerns raised by employees\". Mr Barnett, meanwhile, remains deeply concerned about the safety of the aircraft he helped to build. \"Based on my years of experience and past history of plane accidents, I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,\" he says. \"I pray that I am wrong.\" ",

            "text": "Bombardier has won a trade case in the United States, overturning a decision to impose damaging tariffs on imports of its C-Series aircraft. In December,  the US Commerce Department ruled the UK and Canada had given unfair subsidies to Bombardier to help it build the aircraft. But in a surprise ruling, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) rejected the complaint brought by Boeing. We look at the case. The case relates to a major order for Bombardier from the US airline Delta for 75 C-Series aircraft.  Boeing complained to the US Commerce Department that they had been sold at \"absurdly low prices\" in violation of trade law and this was made possible by unfair subsidies to Bombardier from the British and Canadian governments.  Bombardier has received \u00a3135m in UK aid, almost all of it a loan towards a new C-Series wing factory in Belfast which opened in 2013. About 50 companies in the UK supply Bombardier with parts for the C-Series. The UK government sided with Bombardier.  The company employs about 4,000 people in Northern Ireland. Its main factories are in constituencies held by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who have a confidence-and-supply deal keeping Theresa May in power.  The prime minister lobbied President Donald Trump on Bombardier's behalf, but the government resisted trade union calls to cancel defence contracts with Boeing.  Bombardier said Boeing never lost out in the Delta order as it does not make the small size of plane requested. Some analysts wondered if Boeing was simply out to damage a competitor. Following an investigation last year, it made a final ruling on 20 December. It recommended an import tariff of 292% be added to the price of each C-Series plane sold in America.  US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said: \"The United States will always stand up for American workers and companies being harmed by unfair imports.\" Cost over-runs on the C-Series almost bankrupted Bombardier.  Orders have been sluggish and the fear was tariffs would damage sales prospects in America and have a knock-on impact on jobs.  The stakes were arguably made higher because Bombardier is the biggest manufacturing company in Northern Ireland and is important to its economy. However, even before its victory at the US ITC, Bombardier was hopeful for the future after Airbus announced it would acquire a controlling stake in the C-Series and promised to boost its fortunes.

            "title": "Families of Boeing 737 Max crash victims seek unlawful killing verdict",
            "text": "It is more than four years since a Boeing 737 Max airliner crashed into remote farmland outside the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. One hundred and fifty seven people were killed. On Monday, an inquest in Horsham, West Sussex will finally take place into the deaths of three of the British citizens who were on board. For relatives of those who died, it is a landmark moment. Lawyers for the families will be seeking a verdict of unlawful killing. The inquest will look into the deaths of humanitarian workers Sam Pegram and Oliver Vick, as well as sustainability campaigner Joanna Toole. \"Sam was just a joy to have in your life,\" his mother Deborah says, blinking back tears. \"Right from when he was a little boy, he wanted to help people.\" Sitting at home with her husband Mark and her other son Tom, she struggles to find the right words to tell me about the wound that opened up in their lives when the plane went down. She talks about 25-year-old Sam's smile, and his wicked sense of humour. \"He just made our lives better, really\u2026 and he's left a really big hole.\" The family have spent the past four years fighting legal battles, trying to gain some kind of justice for Sam, as well as to obtain compensation. Now they're simply exhausted. \"It's just been a constant struggle,\" says Mark. \"I mean, on top of the grief and the normal things that you deal with having lost somebody, you to have to continually relive it.  \"You have to tell that story to your lawyers, to opposition lawyers, to a forensic psychologist\u2026 going right into the depths of what you were feeling the day you found out.  \"It's taken its toll.\" Flight ET302 - a passenger flight from Ethiopia to Kenya - crashed shortly after take-off because of a design flaw.  Flight control software that was meant to be used in very limited circumstances to make the plane easier and more predictable to fly deployed at the wrong time due to a sensor failure. It pushed the aircraft into a catastrophic dive, despite the pilots' frantic efforts to keep it in the air. But arguably that plane should never have left the ground in the first place. Just months before, an identical failure had caused another 737 Max to crash into the sea off Indonesia, costing 189 lives. Yet the model was allowed to continue flying. Boeing later admitted responsibility for the loss of ET302.  But under the terms of an agreement reached with the US government in 2021, it gained immunity from prosecution, in return for paying $2.5bn in fines and compensation. That deal was done quietly, without the knowledge of the victims' families. It has been challenged in court, so far without success.  Sam's brother Tom is furious at what he sees as a failure to hold anyone to account for the disaster. \"I feel like, how can you believe in justice when there's people that are responsible for hundreds of deaths?\" he says. \"You'd think in a world where there's justice, within weeks or months there would be people in prison. And there obviously isn't, to this day.\" At the recent Paris Airshow, I met one of Boeing's top executives, chief strategy officer Marc Allen, and I asked him if he had a message for the bereaved families. After expressing \"such deep sympathy and condolence\" for those who lost loved ones in both crashes involving the 737 Max, he emphasised Boeing's new commitment to safety. \"We can be sure we can show up and tell them, 'here's what we do better now, in the face of this terrible, terrible loss,'\" he said.  Reeling off a long list of changes that have been made within the company, he told me he disagreed \"with this idea that there hasn't been full accountability throughout the organisation\". For the Pegrams though, these were \"just words\".  For the family now, the priority is to keep Sam's memory alive. They plan to use compensation funds from Boeing to set up a charitable foundation, to promote the humanitarian causes he cared about. \"We can help refugees, asylum seekers, and we can also help young people who want to go and do the work like Sam did,\" says Mark. Meanwhile, with the crash having occurred in Ethiopia, and most of the legal wrangling in the United States, the inquest is seen as a vital step. It is the only formal inquiry into the affair to take place in this country, and the verdict - though largely symbolic - could send out a powerful message. And for Joanna Toole's father, Adrian, it also serves another purpose. \"For me, it represents what may be my only opportunity to actually talk about Joanna to what is effectively a captive audience,\" he says. \"And what I hope to point out is what has been lost with Joanna's death.  \"To her partner, Paul, to me, and to the international sustainability effort.\"",

            "title": "Boeing's Starliner spacecraft: A guide",
            "text": "Boeing's Starliner is one of two US spacecraft tasked by Nasa with transporting astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). The vehicle is expected to help usher in a new era of private \"taxi services\" operating just above the Earth. When the space shuttle was retired in 2011, Nasa became reliant on Russia for transporting its astronauts to the ISS. In the meantime, Nasa worked on handing this job over to US companies. The space agency chose Boeing and SpaceX to develop new vehicles with the intention of purchasing seats on them for its crew once they started flying. Starliner has an Apollo-like design with conical sides - a shape that's stable when the capsule is plummeting at high speed through the Earth's atmosphere. But it has more autonomy than either the Apollo spacecraft or the shuttle. Boeing's vehicle travels to the ISS and docks with little to no intervention from astronauts. It's also designed to be safer. Unlike the space shuttle, Starliner has an escape system that can propel the crew away from its rocket if an emergency occurs during launch. The spacecraft's full name is Starliner CST-100. \"CST\" stands for Crew Space Transportation and \"100\" refers to the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, the official boundary of space, 100km above the Earth.  The vehicle comes in two main parts, which are attached to each other from launch until shortly before re-entry:  The internal core of the crew module is called the pressure vessel and is manufactured in two halves. Each half is made from a single piece of metal, rather than from different pieces welded together. Eliminating welds reduces the chance of defects that could weaken the structure. After the two halves of the vessel are sealed together, the sloping sides are enclosed within a protective envelope called the backshell. Blankets made of silica and woven glass cover the outside, but areas that receive more heating on re-entry are shielded with ceramic tiles like those used on the space shuttle. The crew module measures 4.6m at its base, with a cabin that accommodates up to seven crew. Nasa missions will take between four and five passengers per flight, swapping the seats for extra cargo storage. If the fifth seat is vacant, Boeing has the option to sell it to a space tourist or carry an astronaut from another country. The control console has two display screens. While SpaceX opted for touchscreens in its Crew Dragon vehicle, Boeing went for the traditional approach of switches and buttons.  Because most spacecraft operations are automated, crew members won't have to engage much with the vehicle. But if, for any reason, they have to assume manual control, the traditional layout gives them everything they need to fly the ship. Former Nasa astronaut Christopher Ferguson, who now works for Boeing, played an instrumental role in Starliner's design. \"To become a part of that was just very compelling. I couldn't give that up for any other opportunity that's out there,\" Ferguson explained. During lift-off, ascent and re-entry, crew members wear the \"Boeing Blue\" flight suit, designed to protect them from a depressurisation event, in which air is lost from the capsule. The company says it is 40% lighter and more flexible than earlier generations of spacesuit. The shoes are more like cross trainers than heavy boots and the gloves are touchscreen-sensitive, so the crew can use tablet computers during flight.  Unlike other designs, this one features a flexible hood and visor instead of a hard helmet. The idea was prompted by Ferguson's experience of returning to Earth in the bulky suits used on the shuttle. After two weeks in microgravity, Ferguson said the metal ring where the helmet attached would push down on his shoulders, causing them to ache.  Starliner can ride one of several rockets to orbit, but will use a modified Atlas V for its first few flights. The 58m-tall Atlas is one of the most reliable rockets available and launches from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. About 31 minutes after lift-off, Starliner - having now separated from the upper stage of its rocket - fires four thrusters to put itself in the right orbit. It then embarks on a 24-hour orbital \"chase\" to catch up with the space station for rendezvous and docking. After spotting the ISS as a bright point of light with its onboard cameras, Starliner manoeuvres closer to the orbiting outpost. It pauses outside a 200m \"keep-out sphere\" until flight controllers clear it to begin the autonomous docking process. The onboard computers analyse data from sensors on the outside of the craft. The information informs an intricate orbital ballet that occurs as hundreds of finely tuned thruster firings guide Starliner into dock. Starliner is designed to stay in orbit for around seven months. After separating from the ISS, the spacecraft fires its thrusters over the Pacific Ocean to begin the process of returning to Earth. The crew module separates from the service module in preparation for the plunge through the atmosphere. During the fiery return, the heatshield covering the base of the capsule is exposed to temperatures of up to 1,650C (3,000F). The shield is made from an \"ablative\" material that slowly sinters away to carry off much of this extreme heat. According to Boeing engineer Tori Wills Pedrotty: \"The ablative is only a couple of inches thick, and at the outside, during re-entry, it's 3,000F. Two or three inches [further in], it's only 300F.  \"So we're able to convert that heat and dissipate it out, so that the astronauts inside - after only a couple more layers of insulation - sit at a balmy 75 degrees.\" At around 9km (30,000ft) above the ground, two drogue parachutes are deployed to begin slowing and stabilising the capsule.  The capsule's three main parachutes then open. At an altitude of about 900m (3,000ft), the landing airbags inflate. These provide the final bit of cushioning to protect astronauts when the spacecraft touches down at one of five designated sites across the western US.  Starliner will be the first US orbital capsule to parachute on to land, rather than the ocean. Boeing says it's quicker and cheaper to refurbish a spacecraft if it hasn't been immersed in salt water. Each spacecraft can be re-used up to 10 times, with a six-month turnaround time. Follow Paul on Twitter.",

            "text": "Singapore's Civil Aviation Authority has temporarily suspended the Boeing 737 Max fleet of aircraft from flying into and out of the country.  The decision comes after an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing Max 8 crashed on Sunday, killing 157 people on board. It was the second fatal accident involving that model in less than five months. Singapore's Changi Airport is the world's sixth busiest and a major hub connecting Asia to Europe and the US. But only a handful of airlines operate Max aircraft in and out of the country. Several airlines and regulators around the world have already grounded the Max 8 model following the crash. Singapore is believed to be the first country to ban all variants of the Max fleet of aircraft. The suspension went into effect from 14:00 local time (06:00 GMT). Singapore's aviation authority said the affected airlines include SilkAir, which operates six Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, as well as China Southern Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, Shandong Airlines and Thai Lion Air. It said it is working with airlines and Changi Airport to minimise the impact on passengers. Experts told the BBC that disruption was likely, however.  Aviation consultant Ian Thomas said: \"This is sure to lead to significant flight cancellations and disruption to schedules as the airlines involved switch to other aircraft types (assuming they are available).\" The BBC's Karishma Vaswani, who is at Changi Airport, reports orderly scenes. Some flights have been cancelled but it is not known if the suspension is to blame. In the US, the country's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) told airlines on Monday it believes Boeing's 737 Max 8 model to be airworthy, despite the two fatal crashes. The Boeing 737 Max fleet of aircraft are the latest in the company's successful 737 line. The group includes the Max 7, 8, 9 and 10 models. By the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 of the Max 8 model out of 5,011 orders. A small number of Max 9s are also operating.  The Max 7 and 10 models, not yet delivered, are due for roll-out in the next few years. The Max 8 that crashed on Sunday was one of 30 ordered as part of Ethiopian Airlines' expansion. It underwent a \"rigorous first check maintenance\" on 4 February, the airline said. Following last October's Lion Air crash in Indonesia, investigators said the pilots had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling, a new feature of the jet. It is not yet clear whether the anti-stall system was the cause of Sunday's crash. Aviation experts say other technical issues or human error cannot be discounted. US aviation officials have said the 737 Max 8 is airworthy and that it is too early to reach any conclusions or take any action. US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on Monday said the FAA would \"take immediate and appropriate action\" if a defect was found in the Max 8. Boeing has confirmed that for the past few months it has been developing a \"flight control software enhancement\" for the aircraft.  Paul Hudson, the president of FlyersRights.org and a member of the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee, nonetheless called for the plane to be grounded. \"The FAA's 'wait and see' attitude risks lives as well as the safety reputation of the US aviation industry,\" Mr Hudson said in a statement on Monday. There were people of more than 30 nationalities on the 10 March flight, including 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians and nine Britons (two of whom were dual nationals travelling on non-British passports).  Among the Canadians was a family of six, originally from India. Kosha Vaidya, 37, and her husband Prerit Dixit, 45 were taking their 14-year-old daughter Ashka and 13-year-old daughter Anushka to Nairobi - where Kosha was born - along with her parents, Pannagesh Vaidya, 73, and Hansini Vaidya, 67. There were also eight Italians, eight Chinese, eight Americans, seven French citizens, six Egyptians, five Germans, four Indians and four people from Slovakia on board. At least 21 passengers were affiliated with the UN and were travelling to a session of its Environment Assembly in Nairobi. \"It is one of the biggest catastrophes we have had in years,\" Michael Moller, director-general of the UN Office in Geneva, told the session on Monday.

All Nippon Airways (ANA) started offering the service on Wednesday and has added more slots for April after they sold out quickly.

The global airline industry is facing its toughest ever challenge to survive amid tough quarantine and travel restrictions, that have already crippled some carriers. Many have thought of creative ways to boost their revenues, with \"flights to nowhere\" proving popular, along with onboard dining on grounded planes. In October, Singapore Airlines offered diners the opportunity to have lunch on a stationary Airbus A380 parked at the city's main airport. Despite a price tag of up to \u00a3380 the first two seating dates sold out within half an hour. Japan's ANA dining experience takes place on a Boeing 777 parked at Haneda Airport in Tokyo. While a first-class seat costs 59,800 yen, diners can opt for a cheaper business-class experience for 29,800 yen. The \"restaurant with wings\" idea was conceived by employees who wanted to make better use of its parked aircraft. Last week, British Airways also made its first class menu available through its catering partner DO & Co, although these meals are for home delivery. There's a choice of four different cook-at-home meal kits, each serving two and starting from \u00a380. On Thursday, the Australian government launched its $1.2bn package aimed at getting people to spend on domestic travel.  The scheme will halve the price of nearly 800,000 airline tickets and runs until the end of July. Qantas, Virgin Atlantic and Jetstar have released half-price fares to more than 20 destinations. Qantas is also trialling a  digital travel app. On Wednesday, the global airline industry body IATA said a digital travel pass for Covid-19 test results and vaccine certificates will be launched on the Apple platform in mid-April. \"The application will only achieve its success once airlines, different countries, airports adopt it,\" a spokesman for IATA said, explaining that its travel pass will help speed up check-ins.",

            "title": "MH17: Families' quest for hope years after Ukraine air disaster",
            "text": "When a passenger plane was shot down by rebels in eastern Ukraine in 2014 the shockwaves reverberated around the world.   Nowhere was the impact greater than among the relatives and friends left behind by the 298 people on board flight MH17 from Amsterdam. As the BBC's correspondent based in the Netherlands, I've been reporting on this air disaster since that July day when a Russian-made surface-to-air missile exploded next to the Malaysia Airlines cockpit. Interviewing victims' families I heard the most soul-shattering memories, of parents being handed a few fragments of their dead children's bones. But over the years I've witnessed a heaviness lift and optimism emerge. Science, logic and reason failed to provide satisfactory answers to families asking gut-wrenching questions. Did the passengers suffer in their final moments? Were they conscious when the Boeing 777 plummeted to the ground? Many families have since sought solace elsewhere, some in spirituality, others in mystery.  Their testimony of how they emerged from the darkness of despair provides a powerful precedent for anyone navigating the wilderness of grief. \"I cried, and I yelled. And I really, really felt it,\" said Robbert van Heijningen, who found out about the disaster, which killed several of his loved ones, while on a camping holiday in France. His immediate response was to travel to Russia: \"to fight the ones who are responsible for this.\" Then came the grief.  No detectives, politicians or scientists seemed able to answer the many questions that plagued the families in the aftermath, and Robbert put his hope in faith. His priest, Jules, assured him the souls of the 298 would be intact.  And when bodies were repatriated from the crash site in pieces, Robbert was advised not to look: \"It's too awful,\" he was warned. \"Body is just body and soul is the spirit of the people who went,\" he comforts himself, scrolling through family snapshots.  Bryce Fredriksz, 23, and his sweetheart, 20-year-old Daisy Oehlers, had been sitting in row 17, on their way to a holiday in Bali. It was months before a charred piece of Bryce's foot and a fragment of Daisy's hipbone were recovered, but for Bryce's mother Silene it was important. \"It felt so good that they were finally home,\" she said. The bones were placed inside a heart-shaped coffin designed for babies. \"The most important thing was that they were identified because then they existed again.\" Even though they were badly burned, it was important to have a cremation, she told me, as a proper goodbye with friends and family. \"Every little piece that was found of them belongs with us, just with us.\" For theologian Mariecke van den Berg, the MH17 disaster presented a totally different perspective from what she was used to.  \"It was a new reality. There are bodies scattered in a field, and how do you talk about that?\" she said as we strolled though a cemetery. \"I found that the Christian tradition is at least one of the possible reservoirs of language that you can tap into.\" She began to explore the significance of bones in the Bible, and the idea that human beings were created by God: \"They have lived and they have been significant for you, and you have loved them. And you have a story together. That doesn't end when they end.\" Schiphol airport near Amsterdam was the last place the passengers and crew on MH17 touched the ground alive. And that idea of keeping memories alive was integral to the decision to conduct the criminal trial in a courtroom close to the runway where the plane took off.   More than 90 relatives testified. Among them, the father of a promising young musician, Thami Uijterlinde, who described the experience as \"the last act of love\" for his child.   None of the four suspects - three Russians and one Ukrainian national - have set foot in court. But investing their faith in justice has provided hope for those left behind of establishing an incontestable truth - to dispel all the misinformation surrounding the missile attack on the plane. A verdict is expected later this year. Sister Mary Philomene Tiernan was an Australian nun known to her friends as Sister Phil.  Days before she boarded flight MH17 she had been on a religious retreat in France where she had shared a poem by Michael Josephson. What will matter, he writes, is not how many people you knew, but how many will feel a lasting loss when you're gone. Aideen Kinlen, who had been her spiritual director, said she had even prayed about her death. \"It wasn't religious as such, it was simply a moral reflection on the things that matter in life,\" she explained. \"It's really what you gave, not what you got.\" Last month, Silene Fredriksz decorated a Christmas tree for the first time since 2014.   \"I didn't believe in anything... not in ghosts, not in spirits, not in the life hereafter, but then MH17 happened.\" Now she recounts signs that she believes indicate Bryce and Daisy are present, such as lights or the television going on and off by themselves. Coincidences comfort her that somehow the couple are still around, somehow sending a message. Robbert van Heijningen and his wife Loes show me what looks strikingly like the silhouette of a plane, jutting out from a sandstone wall in a church in the northern city of Bolsward,  They only noticed it after MH17.  On another occasion they recall driving to light candles for Robbert's brother Erik, sister-in-law Tina and nephew Zeger. \"Three butterflies landed on the windscreen,\" said Robbert who describes himself as a naturally sceptical lawyer. \"It was the first time we saw three, and we said that was them saying goodbye.\" Memories, coincidences and faith are just some of the tools the families have found to treasure the lives of those they lost in the skies above eastern Ukraine. And almost eight years on, they cling to the hope that the individuals to blame will be brought to justice.  You can hear more from the families in Anna's BBC documentary, MH17: Faith after disaster.",

The A380Plus, which was announced ahead of the Paris Airshow, will boast a new wing design intended to improve aerodynamics. Airbus also said the cabin had been optimised to allow up to 80 extra seats \"with no compromise on comfort\". The move has been seen as a way of boosting flagging sales of the A380.   There has been a dearth of orders for the plane as more airlines opt for smaller twin-engine jets, which cost less to fly and maintain. The European plane maker said the new version would burn up to 4% less fuel thanks to its new winglets, which are designed to reduce drag. It will also have an increased maximum take-off weight and need less regular maintenance checks. Airbus said that along with other enhancements, the plane would cut costs for airlines by 13% per seat. Sales chief John Leahy said the plane would offer \"better economics and improved operational performance\".",

An agreement to purchase A320 and A350 XWB aircraft was signed during a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Paris. The order is part of a package of deals signed during Mr Xi's visit to Europe. It comes as rival Boeing has grounded all of its 737 Max jets after two fatal crashes. Airbus said in a statement it signed an agreement with China Aviation Supplies Holding Company covering the purchase by Chinese airlines of Airbus aircraft including 290 A320 planes, and ten A350 XWB jets. The deal is worth an estimated 30bn euros ($34bn; \u00a326bn), according to reports.   \"We are honoured to support the growth of China's civil aviation with our leading aircraft families - single-aisle and wide-bodies,\" Airbus Commercial Aircraft President Guillaume Faury said in a statement.  Mr Faury is due to become Airbus's new chief executive in April. \"Our expanding footprint in China demonstrate our lasting confidence in the Chinese market and our long-term commitment to China and our partners.\"  The deal will likely be a blow for Boeing, under pressure after two fatal crashes involving its 737 Max 8 jets in five months. Many countries banned the aircraft from their airspace after an Ethiopian Airlines crash earlier this month. Boeing later grounded its 737 Max fleet as investigations into the cause of the disaster continue.  Mr Xi kicked off his European tour last week in Italy, where it became the first developed economy to sign up to China's global Belt and Road Initiative. But other European countries and the United States have expressed concern at China's growing influence.",

            "text": "The US government has ordered a review of the way Boeing's 737 Max aircraft got its licence to fly. It comes after two crashes in five months, amid suggestions from experts that there were \"clear similarities\" between the disasters. Transport secretary Elaine Chao has asked the US inspector general to audit the aircraft's certification process. One focus of crash investigators has been the Max's anti-stall system, which Boeing says needs a software update.  In a memo to inspector general Calvin Scovel, Ms Chao said she wanted the review in order to \"assist the Federal Aviation Administration [the regulator] in ensuring that its safety procedures are implemented effectively\". After the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines aircraft last week - which followed a Lion Air disaster in October - there were questions about why the FAA took so long to ground the 737 Max. Reuters has reported that the US Justice Department has also begun preliminary inquiries into the FAA's oversight of the Boeing aircraft. Meanwhile, Europe and Canada said they would seek their own assurances over the safety of the aircraft, a move likely to complicate plans to get the aircraft flying again across the world.  European and Canadian regulators have typically tended to follow the FAA's lead. The European Union's aviation safety agency EASA promised its own deep look at any design improvements. \"We will not allow the aircraft to fly if we have not found acceptable answers to all our questions,\" EASA executive Patrick Ky told an EU parliament committee hearing. Canada, which ground the aircraft before the US, said it would independently certify the 737 Max in the future, rather than accepting FAA validation.  The FAA declined to comment on individual actions by Canada and the EU, but said in a statement that \"the current, historic aviation safety record in the US and globally is achieved through the FAA's robust processes and full collaboration with the aviation community\". The two crashes killed 346 people. While there is no conclusive evidence so far that they are linked, French experts analysing the Ethiopian Airlines' flight data black box say early investigations point to \"clear similarities\". Experts believe a new automated system in Boeing's aircraft - intended to stop stalling by dipping the nose - may have played a role in both crashes, with pilots unable to override it. Boeing said in a statement that it would fully cooperate with the inspector general's review.",

            "text": "Single malt Scotch whisky exported to the United States is to face a tariff of 25% from 18 October. The new duty is part of a raft of measures being imposed by the US in retaliation against EU subsidies given to aircraft maker Airbus. Other goods being targeted include cashmere sweaters, dairy products, pork, books and some machinery. Scotch exports to the US last year were worth $1.3bn (\u00a31bn), with single malts accounting for a large share of that.  The US was given the go-ahead to impose tariffs on $7.5bn (\u00a36.1bn) of goods it imports from the EU following a World Trade Organisation (WTO) ruling on Wednesday. It is the latest chapter in a 15-year battle between the US and the EU over illegal subsidies for planemakers Airbus and rival Boeing. The ruling by the WTO will mean tariffs on EU goods ranging from aircraft to agricultural products. Brussels has threatened to retaliate similarly against US goods. Karen Betts, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said it was a blow to the Scotch whisky sector. \"This is a serious situation for the industry,\" she said.  \"We heard overnight that a 25% import tariff will be imposed on all single malts into the United States and also all Scotch whisky liqueurs, and that's from a position of zero.  \"We've had a zero tariff on imports to the United States for the past 25 years, so this is quite a hike.\" The Scotch whisky industry directly employs about 11,000 people in Scotland, and many more indirectly through its supply chain. More than 7,000 of the jobs are in rural areas across the country. A spokesman for the UK's Department for International Trade said: \"Resorting to tariffs is not in the interests of the UK, EU or US.  \"The UK is working closely with the US, EU and European partners to support a negotiated settlement to the Airbus and Boeing disputes. \"The UK, through the EU, is seeking confirmation from the WTO that we have complied fully with WTO rulings regarding support to Airbus, and should not be subject to tariffs.\" The US first filed the case in 2004, arguing that cheap European loans for Airbus amounted to illegal state subsidies. The WTO decided in favour of the US, which subsequently complained that the EU and certain member countries were not in compliance with the decision, prompting years of further wrangling. The US had sought to impose tariffs on about $11bn in goods. Though the WTO cut that figure to $7.5bn, Wednesday's decision still marks the largest penalty of its kind in the organisation's history. The WTO's dispute settlement body must formally adopt the ruling but is not expected to overturn the decision.",

            "text": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he will seek \"justice\" for those killed on board a Ukrainian passenger plane downed by Iran. Mr Trudeau spoke in Edmonton, Alberta at a vigil for the 57 Canadians killed in the disaster. The PM promised to pursue answers from Iran, which admitted its military shot down the plane in error, killing all 176 people on board.  Iran had previously rejected suggestions that it was to blame. \"This tragedy should have never occurred, and I want to assure you that you have my full support during this extraordinarily difficult time ... you give us purpose to pursue justice and accountability for you,\" said Mr Trudeau, addressing a crowd of 2,300 people in a university gym. \"We will not rest until there are answers.\" Mr Trudeau attended the memorial on Sunday, as a second day of anti-government protests against Iran's leaders erupted. Iran's belated admission that it \"unintentionally\" hit the Boeing plane with missiles has caused outrage at home and abroad. At protests in Tehran and other cities, there were chants against the leadership and reports of clashes with security forces, which fired tear gas.  The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was shot down near Tehran last Wednesday, shortly after Iran had launched missiles at two airbases housing US forces in Iraq. Those strikes were a response to the US killing of senior Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad on 3 January. Dozens of Iranians and Canadians, as well as nationals from Ukraine, the UK, Afghanistan and Sweden died on the plane. Iran has invited Canada, Ukraine and Boeing to take part in an investigation into the disaster. Those responsible, Iran says, will be held accountable and prosecuted. BBC's Jessica Murphy, Edmonton, Alberta Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand gazed out from the photograph projected on the screen with wide smiles, looking like they had been caught laughing at a shared joke.  The \"sweet couple\" likely were.  Along with their two daughters, Daria, 14, and Dorina, 9, they were remembered for their quickness to laughter, their generosity, their full embrace of life. The family of four were among the 13 victims of flight PS752 who came from the Canadian city of Edmonton.   A crowd of some 2,300 people packed into a university gym on Sunday to pay respects to those lost - family, close friends, colleagues, classmates -  whose deaths have left a hole in so many lives.  Prime Minister Trudeau told the crowd that in their sorrow \"your entire country stands with you\".  A friend of Pedram's, through a letter read by his former student Hossein Saghlatoon, said the loss was \"too much to bear\". He was looking forward to many more memorable moments with Pedram and his family, he wrote, \"but alas, the cruel hand of destiny had some other plans\".  After a wave of anti-government protests on Saturday, demonstrators returned to the streets despite a large deployment of security forces. Riot police, members of the elite Revolutionary Guard on motorbikes, and plainclothes security officials were out in force. In one apparently symbolic act rejecting state propaganda, video showed students taking care not to walk over US and Israeli flags painted on the ground at Shahid Beheshti university in Tehran. In some social media clips, protesters can be heard chanting anti-government slogans, including: \"They are lying that our enemy is America, our enemy is right here.\" Many of the protesters are women. US President Donald Trump on Sunday repeated warnings that Iran should not target anti-government protesters, saying, \"the World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching\". In a later tweet, Mr Trump said he \"couldn't care less\" if Iran wants to negotiate, adding it will be \"totally up to them but, no nuclear weapons\". Britain, meanwhile, has condemned the arrest of the UK ambassador to Iran in Tehran as a \"flagrant violation of international law\". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Rob Macaire was detained on Saturday after attending a vigil where he was paying respects to victims of the crash, some of whom were British. Mr Macaire said he left the vigil when some people started chanting and had played no part in the demonstration. Iran on Sunday summoned the ambassador to complain about \"his unconventional behaviour of attending an illegal rally\", the foreign ministry website said. Iranian protesters set a UK flag alight in front of the UK embassy on Sunday. For three days, Iran denied reports its missiles had brought down the plane, with one spokesman accusing Western nations of \"lying and engaging in psychological warfare\". But on Saturday morning, a statement read on state TV accepted the plane had been shot down. Brig-Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the Revolutionary Guards' aerospace commander, said a missile operator had acted independently and alone, mistaking the plane for a \"cruise missile\". He also said he had informed the authorities about what had happened on Wednesday, raising questions about why Iran had denied involvement for so long. Both Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky and Justin Trudeau have demanded accountability from Iran. Mr Trudeau said on Saturday there must be a full investigation with \"full clarity on how such a horrific tragedy could have occurred\".",

            "text": "Acting US Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan has been cleared of allegations that he showed favouritism towards Boeing, his ex-employer. The defence department's inspector general had been investigating him over a complaint filed in March. A watchdog accused him of \"promoting\" Boeing and \"disparaging\" its competitors during meetings.  But the inquiry found that Mr Shanahan had \"fully complied with his ethical obligations and ethical agreements\". Mr Shanahan, who worked at Boeing for 30 years, was serving as deputy defence secretary at the time the allegations were made. The report on the inspector general's findings has been released publicly. It will be submitted to Congress on Thursday. The outcome could pave the way for US President Donald Trump to nominate Mr Shanahan as permanent defence secretary. The White House is yet to comment on who Mr Trump intends to appoint to the role - the Pentagon's highest civilian position. The complaints against Mr Shanahan were filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Mr Shanahan always denied the allegations but said he would support the investigation. As part of the inquiry, more than 30 witnesses were interviewed, including Mr Shanahan, and 1,700 pages of classified documents were reviewed. The inspector general \"took these allegations seriously\", Pentagon official Glenn Fine, who oversaw the investigation, said. \"The evidence showed that Acting Secretary Shanahan fully complied with his ethical obligations and ethical agreements with regard to Boeing and its competitors,\" his statement said. Mr Shanahan has served as interim Pentagon chief since 1 January after his predecessor, Jim Mattis, resigned over policy differences with Mr Trump. To secure the position full-time, the Senate will have to confirm him in a vote. Lawmakers, including the late Arizona Senator John McCain, have expressed concerns over his lack of military and foreign policy experience. Prior to his public service, he rose through the ranks to become a senior executive at Boeing, the world's biggest plane maker. His career there spanned from 1986 to 2017.",

            "text": "An Indian couple reportedly chartered a plane and held a mid-air wedding with more than 160 guests in an effort to escape coronavirus restrictions. Video footage posted on social media appeared to show the couple and their guests packed into the hired jet. The state of Tamil Nadu, where the flight was said to have originated, recently imposed tougher restrictions, limiting weddings to 50 guests. India's aviation authority has launched an investigation, reports said. An official from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) told the Times of India that the SpiceJet staff aboard the flight had been taken off duty. A SpiceJet spokesperson told the Indian Express that the Boeing 737 was booked from Madurai to Bangalore by a travel agent for a trip after a wedding.  The spokesperson said the client was \"clearly briefed on Covid guidelines to be followed and denied permission for any activity to be performed on board\".  India is suffering a devastating second wave of coronavirus that has killed at least 300,000 people, according to official figures. Experts estimate that the real death toll is far higher. Hospitals and crematoriums in the country have been overwhelmed in recent weeks, leading to severe oxygen shortages and bodies being burned around the clock. Many families unable to afford the costs of cremation have illegally buried their loved ones on the banks of the river Ganges or pushed their bodies into the river's waters, raising fears that the death toll is being significantly under-counted.",

            "text": "EasyJet has said it is ready to \"ride the storm\" of uncertainty hitting the aviation industry by expanding in Scotland. The budget airline has added a fifth plane to its Glasgow Airport-based fleet. It said the expansion would mean an extra 340,000 passengers and 50 new jobs as it announced a new Glasgow to Birmingham route. The company said it planned further announcements in the coming weeks. EasyJet's UK boss Ali Gayward said Scotland remained a \"really important market\"  despite rising fuel prices, tough competition and Brexit uncertainty. Ms Gayward told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"We've been expanding in Scotland for a number of years. Our focus the last few times had been in Edinburgh, but we feel right now the time is right to grow in Glasgow. \"There's been a huge amount of development both at the airport and in the city and it's in response to what our customers are telling us.\" EasyJet's expansion plan came after rival budget airline Norwegian Air said it was scrapping flights between Ireland and the US, blaming the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max. And Scottish airline Loganair has said a big rise in compensation claims for weather-hit flights could force regional airlines to cancel routes. Ms Gayward said: \"It's challenging to see what's going on and how it is impacting other airlines. The industry is very cyclical and sadly some airlines fall by the wayside or shrink.\" Asked if airlines may have to make further cuts, she said: \"I think we will see that. We've seen the failure of airlines such as Monarch and Air Berlin. \"Airlines who are not in such a strong position financially - it is a tough time for them, with costs escalating out of control and changing customer demand. \"We're focussed on what we're doing. We think at times like this - this is when EasyJet actually do best - we ride the storm really well and we're well positioned for the future.\" EasyJet's flew its first plane from Luton to Glasgow in November 1995 after the company was launched, and is now the largest airline operating in Glasgow. Francois Bourienne of AGS Airports, which owns Glasgow Airport, said: \"EasyJet's plans to expand operations is fantastic news for both the airport and over one million passengers who travel with the airline from Glasgow each year.\" For the latest business news as it happens, follow BBC presenter Andrew Black's updates each weekday morning on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme between 0600 and 0900.",

            "text": "British Airways has told staff that its Gatwick airport operation may not reopen after the coronavirus pandemic passes. The admission came in a memo, written by the head of BA's Gatwick hub and seen by BBC News. BA's Gatwick operation, which is currently suspended, is roughly a fifth as big as its Heathrow hub. In a separate letter to pilots, BA said it cannot rule out suspending the rest of its Heathrow operation.  In the memo to Gatwick's staff, the company says: \"As you know, we suspended our Gatwick flying schedule at the start of April and there is no certainty as to when or if these services can or will return.\" In the letter to pilots, BA notes that some of its rivals abroad are facing tough competition. It adds that a quarter of BA's 4,300 pilots are set to lose their jobs.  \"We need to ensure that our remaining operation is efficient, flexible and cost-competitive to enable us to survive in an increasingly lean and unpredictable industry,\" says the letter from senior management. How will airlines get flying again? On Tuesday, BA said it was set to cut up to 12,000 jobs from its 42,000-strong workforce because of a collapse in business due to the Covid-19 lockdown.  The airline's parent company, IAG, said it needed to impose a \"restructuring and redundancy programme\" until demand for air travel returns to 2019 levels. The pilots' union Balpa said it was \"devastated\" and vowed to fight \"every single\" job cut. BA has been flying from Gatwick for decades. Before its merger with BOAC in 1974 to form BA, BEA flew its first routes from the hub in 1950. Plane-makers and airlines alike have been struggling to cope with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on their businesses. On Monday, aerospace giant Airbus announced it was furloughing 3,200 staff at its north Wales site. Hours earlier, Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury had warned the company was \"bleeding cash at an unprecedented speed\". Mr Faury also told Airbus' 135,000 staff to brace for potentially deep job cuts and warned that its survival was at stake without immediate action. Meanwhile, US aircraft manufacturer Boeing announced that it would cut 10% of its workforce after it said the lockdown had delivered a \"body blow\" to the business.    Other airlines, including BA's close rival Virgin Atlantic, have been seeking UK government help. The aviation industry as a whole has also been lobbying the government for assistance.  On Monday, industry body Airlines UK urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to extend his job retention scheme beyond June. It said airlines hit by coronavirus would face \"a renewed cash crisis\" if the scheme were withdrawn prematurely.",

Transport Secretary Michael Matheson highlighted the \"important role\" that direct air links between the US and Scotland had in the Scottish economy.

Malcolm Roughead, chief executive of VisitScotland, also welcomed the strengthened links with the US market.  He said: \"It is exciting that this new service from Boston to Edinburgh will open up opportunities for the Scottish tourism industry to engage with a new area of the USA\". Roberto Ioriatti, Delta's vice president - transatlantic, said: \"Boston is our fastest-growing international hub and a daily service from Edinburgh responds to increased demand for travel to the US and provides greater choice when it comes to planning trips for business or pleasure.\"  The announcement comes in the same week that Edinburgh Airport announced it had its busiest ever September, after a record-breaking July and August. Gordon Dewar, chief Executive of Edinburgh Airport said: \"North America has been one of our biggest growth markets and there has been exceptional demand for those services this summer, so to add Boston with Delta is fantastic news.\" More than half a million American tourists visited Scotland in 2017, and the new route will add a further 2,000 seats per week between the US and Scotland.",

            "text": "Aerospace giant Boeing has unveiled its proposal for a lander that could take humans to the Moon's surface. Under a programme called Artemis, the  White House wants to return humans to the Moon by 2024. Its approach, named \"Fewest Steps to the Moon\", would use the huge Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. The company says its plan reduces the complexity involved in sending several different bits of hardware into space on multiple launches. For most robotic space missions, all the hardware needed for the mission is launched on one rocket. Likewise, the crewed Apollo missions to the Moon in the 1960s and 70s required only one lift-off. However, the Artemis missions are expected to involve several flights to loft all the hardware needed. For example, the lander elements are likely to be launched separately from the Orion capsule carrying crew.  Bezos floats 'national team' to build Moon lander To the Moon and Beyond Boeing says it can land astronauts on the Moon with only five \"mission critical events\" - such as launch, orbit insertion and others - instead of the 11 or more required by alternative strategies. Nasa previously said its preferred option was a lunar lander split into three stages, but it left the door open to \"alternative, innovative approaches\". Boeing's proposal uses just two stages - a descent element that gets astronauts down to the surface, and an ascent element to get the crew off the surface and back into lunar orbit at the end of a mission. They are designed to be launched as one unit. The company says its lander can carry itself from lunar orbit to the surface without an additional transfer element, or \"tug\", as previously specified by Nasa. This, it said, would further reduce the launches needed for a mission and simplify the steps required for a successful landing. The company says its lander would be ready for the 2024 mission, called Artemis-3. But Boeing's plan would depend on a more powerful variant of the SLS rocket called Block 1B.  Under current Nasa plans, the Block 1B version of the rocket wouldn't be ready until 2025. However, Nasa's procurement process allows for the use of two separate landers from different companies on the Artemis-3 and Artemis-4 missions (Artemis-4 is due to fly in 2025). \"Whether serving in Nasa's 2024 or 2025 mission slot, Boeing's approach maximises return from agency investments in previous and ongoing programs to allow for the simplest and therefore highest probability path back to the lunar surface,\" the company said in a statement. The lander will use key technologies from Boeing's CST-100 Starliner capsule, designed to carry astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). The Boeing lander would be able to dock with the Gateway, a planned space station in lunar orbit, but it would not require it. It could instead dock with Nasa's Orion spacecraft directly for a simpler mission profile. Last month, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos announced the formation of a \"national team\" that would make a separate bid to build the lander for 2024. Bezos' space company Blue Origin has teamed up with aerospace giants Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper to put together a proposal for a three-stage lander. Follow Paul on Twitter.",

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) also said that existing planes should be updated with the changes. The recommendations came at the end of the board's investigation of the deadly Southwest Airlines incident. Boeing said it was making enhancements. The death of Jennifer Riordan of New Mexico, a 43-year-old Wells Fargo vice president and mother of two, in April 2018 was the first on a US passenger airline since 2009. She was killed after an engine exploded and shattered a plane window.  In its final report on the accident, the safety board said that a fan blade in the engine was cracked due to \"fatigue\". It punctured its case, creating fragments that crashed into the window. The incident, which caused injuries in eight other passengers and led to an emergency landing in Philadelphia, followed an earlier engine fan issue - known as a \"fan blade out\" event on a Southwest 737-700 flight. NTSB chair Robert Sumwalt said the refit of the fan cowl structure could be expensive but was necessary to improve safety in the event of a fan blade issue. \"These recommendations show the way toward greater safety even when a fan blade out event occurs,\" said NTSB chair Robert Sumwalt. Boeing has delivered about 7,000 737 NG planes to customers. It is an earlier generation of planes than the Boeing Max series, which has been grounded after deadly crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia. The safety board did not call for 737 NG planes to be grounded. Airlines are now inspecting fan blades on a more regular basis, it added. Engine manufacturer CFM International is a transatlantic joint venture between General Electric Co and France's Safran SA.",

More layoffs are expected, some of which may affect the UK. The reductions had been expected since Boeing revealed plans last month to slash its global workforce by 10% - or roughly 16,000 jobs. \"I wish there were some other way,\" chief executive Dave Calhoun wrote in an email to staff. Boeing has been reeling from a drop in demand for aircraft, as travel plunges amid the pandemic and worsens the pressures on the company, which was already in crisis following two fatal crashes of its 737 Max plane and the global grounding of the plane last year. In April, customers cancelled more than 100 orders for the 737 and the firm said it had received no new reservations. Boeing on Wednesday said it had resumed making 737 Max planes at its Renton, Washington factory at a \"low rate\" and noted that some airlines were reporting signs of recovery. \"But these signs of eventual recovery do not mean the global health and economic crisis is over,\" Mr Calhoun said. \"Our industry will come back but it will take some years to return to what it was just two months ago.\" Even before the pandemic, the crisis at Boeing, which forced it to halt 737 manufacturing in January, was expected to be a major drag on the US economy. Suppliers such as General Electric and Spirit AeroSystems Holdings have also announced major job cuts. The job losses confirmed on Wednesday include 6,670 involuntary cuts and 5,520 voluntary redundancies in the US. The firm, which has about 18,000 international staff including more than 2,500 in the UK, said it also announced 400 reductions its factory in Winnipeg, Canada and another 230 near Melbourne, Australia. Both plants produce parts for the firm's commercial aviation business. Boeing said \"several thousand remaining layoffs will come in much smaller additional groups over the next few months.\" \"This may involve a reduction in numbers in some parts of Boeing's UK workforce,\" the company told the BBC. \"Our team is our priority and we will actively support colleagues into new roles wherever we can. We are committed to the UK.\"",

He added: \"As no B787s have been retired from commercial service to date, there is almost no USM market for this platform at the moment.  \"We are entering into a specialist area and hope to become a market leader in the provision of USM for the platform which will enable the reduction of the cost of maintenance events for B787 aircraft owners.\" EirTrade declined to reveal the identity of the owner of the two aircraft which are being scrapped, citing a confidentiality agreement, but it has been reported that they were formerly operated by Norwegian Air Shuttle. The disassembly process will be co-ordinated in Prestwick and managed by EirTrade, and is expected to take about three months to complete.",

            "text": "When an Air India Express plane with 190 people on board crashed at an airport in the southern Indian state of Kerala last week, dozens of locals rushed to help. They rescued passengers and took them to hospitals. Officials say this was part of the reason that the death toll was so low. Ashraf Padanna spoke to some of the volunteers. Fazal Puthiyakath, 32, and eight of his friends were in quarantine when they recently received an unexpected visitor. It was a police officer who introduced himself as Nizar. Standing a distance away, he told them he had come to pay tribute to their bravery.  \"I have great respect for you, but I brought nothing to give you. This is the only gift I can give,\" he told them, raising his arms in salute. Mr Puthiyakath and his friends were among dozens of locals who had rushed to the Kozhikode (formerly known as Calicut) airport, when a repatriation flight coming in from Dubai crashed while landing and broke in two. Eighteen people, including the two pilots, were killed.  The group had helped rescue dozens of people and were now in quarantine, because of the risk of catching Covid-19 from the people they rescued.  An image of the policeman saluting the men as they stood on the veranda of their quarantine centre went viral on social media. The group say they have also got countless calls - mostly from relatives of people on the flight - thanking them for saving their loved ones.  Mr Puthiyakath, who lives 100 metres (300ft) from the airport, says he was one of the first responders at the site. \"There were around six of us who managed to get there within a few minutes of the crash. The gates were shut, and people were crying for help,\" he told the BBC. \"The security people initially refused to open the gates as firefighters were spraying foam on the plane.\"  But with the fire risk dissipated, they were allowed in. Mr Puthiyakath says the scene was heart rending.  \"Many passengers were unconscious. Some were stuck under their seats. We needed to unfasten their seat belts and get them out of the plane.\" They began helping rescue workers cut people free and get them to hospitals.  Regional fire officer K Abdul Rasheed, who was at the crash site, said the local volunteers took a massive risk. \"Firefighters at the airport sprayed foam immediately after the crash to prevent fire. But a small spark or lapse could have led to a big tragedy,\" he said. Meanwhile, news of the crash spread through the community via WhatsApp. Dozens more rushed in to see how they could help. So by the time rescue workers began bringing out passengers, there was a fleet of private vehicles ready to take them to hospital. Officials say this alone saved many lives because hospitals had only a limited number of ambulances. Fazal Karalil, 33, a truck driver, and also one of those who arrived on the scene, told the BBC that he didn't even think about the risk of coronavirus at the time.  \"We used any vehicle at our disposal, including trucks and auto-rickshaws. There was no time to wait for an ambulance.\" Between them, locals ferried victims to some 20 hospitals within a 30km (18 mile) radius.  \"The volunteers took them to hospitals immediately, without waiting for ambulances to arrive. They cared little about their own safety,\" Mr Rasheed said. Dr PP Venugopalan, director of emergency medicine at a hospital in Kozhikode, believes the community action saved at least 10 lives. \"The people in the neighbourhood had received some training in trauma care and how to handle such a situation,\" he told the BBC. \"In 2012 the district administration conducted a mock drill on air crashes involving some 650 people, which I think was the biggest in India. The [Air India] plane fell exactly on the same spot.\" \"It took one month to train the local community members, including taxi drivers. Everyone received hands-on training. I think that also helped to reduce the casualties.\" Some 200,000 people in Kerala's Kozhikode and Malappuram districts have received training in primary trauma care and early resuscitation. Dr Venugopalan said that the community response was so efficient that most of the ambulances he sent returned empty from the airport as volunteers had already rushed the passengers to hospitals in their private vehicles.   Meanwhile, apart from getting them medical attention, locals also helped passengers who were desperate for news of loved ones and family who had been with them on the flight.  \"We immediately formed a WhatsApp group of rescue workers and posted whatever information we received so that they could find out if their family members were in other hospitals,\" Mr Puthiyakath said. By the time he got home, Mr Puthiyakath added, it was around 3:30 in the morning. They reported back to police at the site of the crash a few hours later, and were then admitted into quarantine.  Since then, they have all been treated like heroes - their stories featured on the social media feeds of prominent journalists and celebrities.  \"People are now showering us with love and affection after we entered the mandatory 14-day quarantine. They send us good food every day,\" laughs Mr Karalil. Justice Devan Ramachandran of the Kerala High Court penned a poetic tribute to the locals who volunteered on a news portal dedicated to legal matters. \"Gods came down from the heavens yesterday. Ordinary men who had no fear for themselves but deep love for all. Men who risked Covid and braved injury so that those in greater pain could be saved.\" \"Kerala is safe in the hands of these valiant and pure souls.\" Ashraf Padanna is a Kerala-based journalist",

            "text": "Bombardier's sales chief has sought to reassure UK staff over the Canadian planemaker's alliance with Airbus. Fred Cromer said last month's surprise announcement that Airbus would take control of its C-Series aircraft \"would only strengthen Bombardier\". The aerospace and rail company employs 4,000 people in Belfast, with about 1,000 making C-Series wings. Speaking at the Dubai Airshow, he said the Airbus deal meant higher production and \"more wings coming out of Belfast\". \"My message to all employees on the C-Series programme, and certainly in Belfast, is to keep doing what you're doing. You are producing in Belfast amazing wing technology,\" the president of Bombardier's commercial aircraft division told the BBC. The aircraft is at the centre of a US-Canada dispute.  Production of the C-Series has gone over-budget and been dogged by delays. US manufacturer Boeing has complained that the aircraft is being subsidised and sold below cost in the US. Earlier this year the US Department of Trade sided with Boeing that C-Series sales in the US should be slapped with import duties of up to 300%. A final ruling is expected early next year. That put a question mark over the future of the programme and a sale of 75 jets to US airline Delta. Then last month, Bombardier announced that Boeing rival Airbus would take a majority stake in the C-Series, putting its production and marketing muscle behind the aircraft. Airbus is to expand its production plant in Alabama, which will increase US content of the aircraft and help cut costs. Mr Cromer said this move was \"about increasing volume of the aircraft, and that should make people feel good in Belfast\". The Alabama expansion would create more jobs at Bombardier, he said. \"It is not a replacement of jobs. The US production line will give us bigger volume and give us access to the US marketplace.\" Delta has already said it will not pay the huge import tariffs on its Bombardier aircraft. Mr Cromer acknowledged that the delivery timetable for the Delta order could be adjusted if the trade dispute holds up the order. He said that an unnamed European airline was considering buying 61 C-Series aircraft, a deal that he hoped would be finalised by the end of this year. That potentially could help Bombardier if it was forced to reschedule the Delta deal. Mr Cromer said Delta was committed to the aircraft and was prepared to wait if necessary, although the airline was unhappy with Boeing's action. Other C-Series customers include Air Canada, Lufthansa and Latvia's AirBaltic.",

            "title": "Boeing delays rerun of Starliner space capsule test",
            "text": "Boeing says it is checking the propulsion system valves on its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft, after Tuesday's planned launch was postponed.  The CST-100 Starliner will launch from Florida at some point to showcase how it can ferry crews to and from the International Space Station (ISS). It will be the second test flight, and conducted with no people aboard. The previous demonstration in 2019 encountered software problems that very nearly caused the loss of the capsule. The Starliner will ride to orbit on an Atlas-5 rocket from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Controllers had been targeting Tuesday for the launch but scrubbed the countdown with two-and-a-half hours left on the clock, to allow for investigation of technical issues related to the capsule's propulsion system. Now Boeing says a rescheduled launch on Wednesday will not happen either, because it needs more time to discover the reason for \"unexpected valve position indications in the propulsion system\". It's just over 10 years since Boeing first presented its design for the CST-100 Starliner at the Farnborough Air Show in the UK. It was a response to the call for commercial companies to take over the responsibility for low-Earth orbit crew transportation, post the soon-to-retire space shuttles. The US space agency (Nasa) gave technical and financial support to both Boeing and the SpaceX company, to help them develop new capsules. The idea was that the vehicles would then be engaged on a commercial basis whenever Nasa needed astronauts sent up to the ISS. But while SpaceX is now two crewed operational flights into this privatised era, Boeing has yet to run a single crewed mission in a Starliner. And that's because Boeing's first unpiloted \"Orbital Flight Test\" in December 2019 went seriously awry. The problems started with a clock error on the capsule just after launch that made the vehicle think it was in a different flight phase than was really the case. This prompted the onboard computer system to over-fire Starliner's thrusters and burn so much fuel it became impossible to reach the intended destination of a docking with the space station. Controllers on the ground could see the problem playing out but had difficulty communicating with the spacecraft. After the truncated mission, it also emerged that poorly designed software could have resulted in the capsule colliding with its aft service section when the two were commanded to separate just prior to re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. Fortunately, this issue was caught and prevented, and the capsule landed safely in the New Mexico desert. The post-mission review initiated a series of re-designs and upgrades that have enabled Boeing to attempt an Orbital Flight Test 2 (OFT-2). Chris Ferguson, a former Nasa astronaut and Boeing's director of Starliner mission operations, said the company had run full-mission duration simulations of the new software on the capsule.  The new code, he added, had implemented every correction recommended by the review. \"We fixed every one, we addressed every one. We want this next flight to be as clean as it could possibly be,\" he told reporters. \"We have thoroughly dug into, tested and verified hundreds of times the software code, to ensure that it performs exactly the way we intend on OFT-2.\" The re-run will follow the same profile: an uncrewed mission to the ISS. That said, an anthropomorphic test device, more commonly known as a flight dummy, dubbed \"Rosie the Rocketeer\", will once again strap in for the ride. Rosie and \"her\" capsule will stay attached to the station for five days, before departing for a parachute-assisted descent and landing at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. If Boeing can put the flaws of OFT-1 behind it, Nasa could clear Starliner to start carrying people before the end of the year. This would finally give the agency the two new crew-transportation systems it sought when the shuttles were retired to museums exactly 10 years ago.  \"This is a huge component to returning this launch capability from the United States and having redundancy between SpaceX and Boeing, so that we're not reliant on just one company to get astronauts to the International Space Station,\" said Nicole Mann, a Nasa astronaut who has been selected to fly on the first crewed Starliner mission. And this capability would also open up space to wider participation, she believed: \"You're going to see more folks in low-Earth orbit who are not Nasa astronauts. That's great. I think for the younger generation, they're going to see scientists, engineers and maybe journalists in space, and they're going to be able to capture the amazement of space and share the experience.\"",

            "title": "Boeing chief fired but 737 concerns persist",
            "text": "Boeing has fired its chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, in a bid to restore confidence in the firm after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max plane. More than 340 people died in the disasters, prompting accusations that Boeing put profit before safety. Families of the victims welcomed Mr Muilenberg's resignation as overdue. But they said Boeing's decision to replace him with a long-time board member raised questions about its commitment to change. Boeing named David Calhoun, who has served on the firm's board since 2009 and is its current chairman, as chief executive and president.  \"While the resignation of Mr Muilenburg is a step in the right direction, it is clear that the Boeing Company needs a revamp of its corporate governance,\" said Paul Njoroge, who lost his wife, three children and mother-in-law when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed in March.  Mr Calhoun \"is not the right person for the job\", he added. Zipporah Kuria, whose father was also killed on the Ethiopian Airlines flight, said Mr Muilenburg should have been replaced \"a long time ago\" but responsibility for the crashes is shared.  \"I feel as though a lot more people should have resigned including the person who's becoming CEO,\" she told the BBC. Boeing has been under intense scrutiny since two 737 Max planes crashed within five months of each other, first in Indonesia and then in Ethiopia.  The 737 Max fleet has been grounded worldwide since March. While the company had been hoping to have the best-selling jet back in the air by the end of this year, US regulators have made it clear that it would not be certified to return to the skies that quickly. Last week, Boeing said it would halt production of the aircraft. Then on Friday, the company's reputation took another hit when its Starliner spacecraft suffered technical problems that prevented it from taking the right path to the International Space Station. Boeing's board said it had \"decided that a change in leadership was necessary to restore confidence in the company moving forward as it works to repair relationships with regulators, customers, and all other stakeholders\". Mr Calhoun, a private equity executive, will take over from 13 January.  Lawrence Kellner, a board member since 2011, is to become non-executive chairman immediately. \"Under the company's new leadership, Boeing will operate with a renewed commitment to full transparency, including effective and proactive communication with the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration], other global regulators and its customers,\" it said. Despite the ouster, some of the firm's harshest critics in Washington said they still had questions about the firm's commitment to change. Senator Richard Bumenthal said: \"The company needs new leadership across the board who will take safety seriously.\"  Michael Stumo, who lost his daughter Samya Rose on the Ethiopian Airlines flight and has organised victims' families against Boeing, called the resignation a \"good first step toward restoring Boeing to a company that focuses on safety and innovation\". \"The next step is for several board members who are underperforming or unqualified to resign,\" he said.  Air safety officials investigating the tragedies have identified an automated control system in the plane, known as MCAS, as a factor in both crashes. Boeing has said the MCAS software system, which relied on a single sensor, received erroneous data, which led it to override pilot commands and push the aircraft downwards.  It has said it is fixing the software and has overhauled its review procedures. But US lawmakers, who are investigating the company, have said the firm was aware that the software system could be unreliable. They have accused the company of trying to hide the risks and rush the plane back into service. Congressman Peter DeFazio, who leads a committee investigating Boeing, had called for Mr Muilenburg's resignation in an interview with the New York Times, published over the weekend. In a statement on Monday, he said the shake-up was \"long overdue\". Mr Muilenburg first joined Boeing in 1985. He led the company's defence, space and security division prior to his appointment as chief executive in 2015. He was stripped of his role as chairman of Boeing's board of directors in October and later agreed to give up his bonus. However, Boeing, including Mr Calhoun, had continued to express confidence in him. Dennis Muilenburg's departure was inevitable, although the timing was unexpected. Since the two accidents, he has faced intense criticism over the corporate culture that existed at Boeing on his watch, and over the company's relationship with regulators. Questions have been asked about how a seemingly flawed aircraft was allowed into service in the first place, and why it was allowed to continue flying after the first accident. There have been claims - emphatically denied by the company - that it prioritised profits and speed of production over safety. His response to the crisis has also come under fire. Although he insisted that Boeing \"owned\" its failures, he also repeatedly said that the crashes were the result of a chain of events. This was seen by some as an attempt to divert blame away from the aerospace giant. The final humiliation came last week, when Boeing announced it would have to suspend production of the 737 Max, because regulators had yet to clear the aircraft as safe to fly again. For months, Mr Muilenburg had insisted the plane would be back in the air by the end of the year.  He had lost credibility, and the board decided he had to go. ",

            "text": "A Chinese amphibious aircraft, the largest in production, has made a successful one-hour maiden flight. The plane, roughly the size of a Boeing 737 but with four turboprop engines, took off from Zhuhai airport in the southern province of Guangdong. The plane can carry 50 people and can stay airborne for 12 hours. It has firefighting and marine rescue duties but also military applications, which could be put to use in the disputed South China Sea region. The AG600, codenamed Kunlong, can reach the southernmost edge of China's territorial claims in the area. State media Xinhua described the plane as \"protector spirit of the sea, islands and reefs\". The take-off of the flight was carried live on state television and its return was greeted by flag-waving crowds and military music. The plane has been eight years in development, has a maximum take-off weight of 53.5 tonnes and a wingspan of 38.8m (127ft). There are 17 orders already from within China. China's policy on the South China Sea is hotly contested by a number of neighbouring countries and last year a tribunal dismissed Beijing's claims to much of the region. Though sizeable, the AG600 is dwarfed by the famous flying boat of billionaire Howard Hughes. The Spruce Goose, or more technically the Hughes H-4 Hercules, had a wingspan of 97.54m. However it made only one flight, which lasted about 26 seconds, in 1947, and never flew again. It is on display in a museum in Oregon. The Martin Mars seaplane was made by the Glenn L Martin Company as a World War Two transporter for the US Navy and has a wingspan of 61 metres (200ft).  Some were later adapted as water bombers and have been in service in Canada on firefighting duties.     The Russian-built Beriev A-40 Albatros had a wingspan of 41.62m, but only two were fully or partially built. The first flight was in 1986 and the project was suspended.  There have been unconfirmed reports of a revival and a small batch ordered by the Russian navy, but what form the plane will take is unclear.",

            "title": "Air India sale: Who'll buy the debt-laden carrier?",
            "text": "India's government has decided to sell a controlling stake in the loss-making national carrier, Air India. It is putting 76% of the business up for sale in what would be India's most high profile asset sale in decades.  Air India has relied on taxpayer-funded bailouts to stay operational - and the new buyer would take on about $5bn (\u00a33.6bn) of debt.  If privatisation goes ahead, it will be a boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's claims to be a reformist leader. But it is not a done deal.  Such plans have been abandoned before, and unions have threatened wide-ranging protests if ministers push ahead this time.    Once the country's only airline, Air India has lost market share to new entrants and suffered from a reputation for poor service and cancelled flights. It has not turned a profit since 2007 - but with India seeing passenger growth of around 20% per year and analysts saying the Indian market is vastly underserved - it could still be a tempting prospect for would-be buyers.  According to documents released by the government, Air India will be put up for sale as four different entities.  Bidders are allowed to make separate offers for the four divisions - or for a combination of them. International routes are the most lucrative part of the Air India business,  with slots at major international airports including London Heathrow and New York JFK. IndiGo, India's biggest airline, has said that it would like to carve out Air India's international passenger airline operations - to add to the seven international destinations it already flies to. But that is not an option currently on the table - and Indigo said it would also \"evaluate\" the option of taking on all of the airline business and see if it was \"economically feasible for us to go down that path\". \"At the end of the day, this exercise is not about becoming bigger for the sake of being bigger - it is all about profitable growth,\" co-founder Rahul Bhatia said. But he was clear IndiGo was not looking at buying all of Air India's businesses and subsidiaries.  \"In our view, that would be a herculean task which would at best be a very challenging proposition and at worst an impossible task, unless an organisation is willing to fund large losses for a very long time,\" Mr Bhatia said. Another potential buyer is Vistara - the joint venture airline run between India's Tata Group and Singapore Airlines. Earlier this month, Singapore Airlines general manager David Lim told the BBC that it was \"open\" to an Air India bid. \"We haven't closed the doors and when that happens we will look at it\", he said  Indian rules state that majority ownership of any national airline needs to be with an Indian national. So while international carriers can make a bid - the biggest stake they can hold is 49%. Jet Airways, another Indian carrier, is also likely to take a serious look at an offer - perhaps in partnership with an international carrier. Media reports suggest Air France and Delta may be interested.  The government has waived some of the criteria for existing Indian airline operators to make bids - relating to net worth and recent profitability - so long as they bid as part of a consortium. Qatar Airways was another international airline linked with buying a stake in Air India, but it has since denied any interest. The eventual buyer of Air India may eventually have to list the airline on the stock exchange - which would be a clear incentive to make it profitable within a fixed time frame. It is likely that at this point, the government would then sell its remaining 24% in the business. The buyer will be taking on about $5bn of debt. However, this is only about half of what the airline owes. So in effect the buyer is getting a  smaller proportion of the debt than it might expect for a 76% stake - which might make things more appealing. Would-be bidders have until 14 May to make initial proposals. Shortlisted bidders will be informed by 28 May. ",

            "title": "Iran plane crash: Airliner 'was trying to return to airport'",
            "text": "A plane that crashed in Iran with 176 people on board was trying to return to the airport, Iranian investigators say. The Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 went down just minutes after taking off from Tehran's airport on Wednesday, leaving no survivors.  An initial probe found the aircraft experienced a problem as it was leaving the airport zone, and was \"on fire\". Ukraine said it was examining various possible causes, including an anti-aircraft missile strike. On Thursday, Oleksiy Danylov, the secretary of Ukraine's security and defence council, said in a Facebook post (in Ukrainian) that three other main hypotheses were being considered: Mr Danylov said Ukrainian investigators, who are in Iran, wanted to search for possible debris from a missile at the site of the crash. Iran is known to have Russian missile defence systems. The investigation would include experts who worked on the investigation into the 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine, Mr Danylov added. The crash came just hours after Iran carried out missile strikes on two airbases housing US forces in Iraq. However, there is no evidence the two events are linked. Amid tensions heightened by the US killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani on 3 January, Iran has said it will not hand over the recovered black box flight recorders to Boeing or to the US. Under global aviation rules Iran has the right to lead the investigation, but manufacturers are typically involved. Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation (CAOI) chief Ali Abedzadeh said: \"The plane, which was initially headed west to leave the airport zone, turned right following a problem and was headed back to the airport at the moment of the crash.\" Mr Abedzadeh added that witnesses saw the plane \"on fire\" before the crash, and that pilots hadn't made any distress calls before trying to return to Imam Khomeini airport. \"Several domestic and foreign flights were flying in Iranian space at the same altitude of 8,000ft (2,400m). The issue of the missile's impact on the aircraft cannot be true in any way,\" he said.  Mr Abedzadeh said the initial findings had been sent to Ukraine and the US, where Boeing has its headquarters.  He was earlier quoted as saying that \"terrorism\" had played no role in the crash. Sweden and Canada had also been sent the findings, as their nationals were on board, he added. Normally, the US National Transportation Safety Board would have a role to play in any international investigations involving US-made Boeings. But the board must act with permission and in accordance with legislation of the foreign country concerned. In comments published by Iran's Mehr news agency, Mr Abedzadeh, said: \"We will not give the black box to the manufacturer and the Americans. \"This accident will be investigated by Iran's aviation organisation but the Ukrainians can also be present,\" he added. Mr Abedzadeh said it was not yet clear which country would analyse the black boxes - a cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier said that \"a thorough and independent investigation will be conducted in accordance with international law\", and that he would speak to Iranian leaders to step up co-operation in investigating the crash. Ukraine is observing a day of national mourning on Thursday. Boeing said it was \"ready to assist in any way needed\", while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country expected to have a role in the investigation and had offered technical assistance.  The Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 to Kyiv had 167 passengers and nine Ukrainian crew on board.  The majority of passengers were from Iran and Canada. Ukraine's Tehran embassy initially blamed engine failure but later removed the statement, saying any comment regarding the cause of the accident prior to a commission's inquiry was not official. There was good visibility when the plane went down near Iran's capital, according to the Flightradar24 aviation website. Officials from the airline said the crew were experienced.  Among the victims were 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians including all nine crew, 10 Swedes, four Afghans, three Britons and three Germans, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said. Fifteen of the dead were children. But the German government later said \"we currently have no knowledge that German citizens are among the victims of the plane crash in Iran\". Iran's head of emergency operations said 147 of the victims were Iranian. That would suggest that 65 of the foreign nationals had dual nationalities. The Ukrainian airline gave a helpline number for further information about passengers: +38-044-581-50-19. Mr Trudeau said 138 passengers on the flight were en route to Canada via Kyiv. \"All people who won't be coming home to their parents, their friends, their colleagues or their family,\" he said. \"All had so much potential, so much life ahead of them\". Flight data from the Ukrainian Airlines Boeing 737-800 is openly available online. It shows that the plane climbed normally after taking-off from Tehran.  It reached nearly 8,000ft before the aircraft's data suddenly disappears.  This is unusual and would suggest some type of catastrophic incident on board the plane. We have no evidence at this stage to tell us what caused the incident. According to a former air crash investigator, any suggestion of engine failure feels premature. This possibility can't be ruled out at this early stage but an airliner such as the Boeing 737-800 is designed to keep flying if there is an engine failure.  Plus, if there was a failure then we would normally expect the flight data to show the plane's climb becoming less steep.  Have you been personally affected by this story?

In 2012, the WTO found that state and federal programmes provided Boeing with billions of dollars in illegal subsidies.  On 9 June the WTO's dispute panel found most of those issues had been addressed.  However, generous tax benefits offered by the state of Washington, where Boeing has a large presence and which are worth an estimated $800m to date, continue. Both sides claimed the panel's June findings as a victory. The WTO has also found that Europe provided billions in illegal subsidies to Airbus.",

            "title": "Boeing announces fixes for its 737 Max aircraft",
            "text": "Boeing has issued changes to controversial control systems linked to two fatal crashes of its 737 Max planes in the past five months. But it is still not certain when the planes, which were grounded worldwide this month, will be allowed to fly. Investigators have not yet determined the cause of the accidents. As part of the upgrade, Boeing will install an extra warning system on all 737 Max aircraft, which was previously an optional safety feature. Neither of the planes, operated by Lion Air in Indonesia and Ethiopian Airlines, that were involved in the fatal crashes carried the alert systems, which are designed to warn pilots when sensors produce contradictory readings. Boeing said that airlines would no longer be charged extra for that safety system to be installed. The planemaker has also issued an upgrade to the software that has been linked to the crashes.  The Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System, better known as MCAS, is software designed to help prevent the 737 Max 8 from stalling. It reacts when sensors in the nose of the aircraft show the jet is climbing at too steep an angle, which can cause a plane to stall. But an investigation of the Lion Air flight last year suggested the system malfunctioned, and forced the plane's nose down more than 20 times before it crashed into the sea killing all 189 passengers and crew. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says there are similarities between that crash and the Ethiopian accident on 10 March. Boeing has redesigned the software so that it will disable MCAS if it receives conflicting data from its sensors.  Ethiopian Airlines crash: Six charts on what we know In a briefing to reporters, Boeing said that the upgrades were not an admission that the system had caused the crashes. The FAA itself also came under scrutiny on Wednesday. At a Senate hearing to discuss airline safety, senators questioned the FAA's acting head, Daniel Elwell, about the regulator's practice that involves employees of a plane manufacturer in the process of inspecting, testing and certifying the company's own aircraft.   The practice was described by one senator, Richard Blumenthal, as leaving \"the fox guarding the henhouse\".  Mr Elwell denied that it was \"self-certification\" arguing that the FAA \"retains strict oversight authority\" of the process. He said that the practice was used \"globally\", including by the European Aviation Safety Agency. Mr Elwell added that if the FAA were unable to delegate these tasks to planemakers, it would have to recruit 10,000 more employees, costing the regulator an additional $1.8bn. The FAA was also criticised for being the last safety regulator to ground the Boeing aircraft following the Ethiopian Airline crash on 10 March.   Calvin Scovel, inspector general of the Department of Transportation, who also appeared before Congress, said: \"Other safety regulators around the world decided in their role as safety regulators, they needed to drive risk to zero and they did that by grounding the aircraft.\" However, Mr Elwell said the FAA wanted to wait until they received relevant information before they made a decision. \"We may have been the last country to ground the aircraft, but the United States and Canada were the first countries to ground the aircraft with data for cause and purpose,\" he said.  Mr Elwell said that he was \"confident\" in the MCAS system and that pilots were trained in how to deal with a situation where a plane drops suddenly. However, when asked about how he would have handled a plane that dropped 21 times in a matter minutes as the Lion Air flight in Indonesia did before it crashed last October, Mr Elwell, a trained pilot, said: \"I'd have to get back to you on the specific.\"   Earlier, announcing the package of cockpit upgrades, Boeing said a final version of the software would be submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) by the end of the week. But it added that airlines would have to install the new software, give feedback on its performance, and train pilots before the changes could be certified and the planes passed safe to fly again. A joint investigation by the US National Transportation Safety Board, France's aviation investigative authority BEA and Ethiopia's Transport Ministry is expected to release a preliminary report into the Ethiopian crash this week. A Boeing official said: \"Following the first incident in Indonesia we followed the results of the independent authorities looking at the data, and, as we are always looking to ways to improve, where we find ways to improve, we make those changes to make those improvements.\"",

            "text": "A mid-air collision between two vintage planes could have had a \"catastrophic outcome\" had it not been for \"providence\", an investigation found. The Mustangs collided when they both flew the same side of a Boeing B-17 rather than one flying on each side of it at a show near Cambridge last year. One pilot failed to stick to the agreed formation plan, the report said. There was only minor damage, but an investigation cited pilot \"complacency\" during preparation for the display. Both pilots managed to land their 1944 P-51 Mustangs safely after the accident during the Battle of Britain Air Show at Imperial War Museum Duxford on 23 September. Before the formation flypast section of the display the two pilots had agreed one would join the B-17 on the right side and the other on the left, an Air Accident Investigations Branch (AAIB) report stated. However, once in the air, both tried to join on the right, causing the tail of one plane to make contact with the propeller of the other, damaging it, along with the left horizontal stabiliser of the other. The report into the accident found the pilots did not do a \"walk-through\" of the formation part of the display and were \"predominantly focused\" on the aerobatics they were to perform. THE AAIB concluded: \"There appears to have been omissions, possibly resulting from a degree of complacency during the briefings and subsequent walk-through\". It added: \"It was only providence that prevented this accident from resulting in a catastrophic outcome.\" Following the investigation, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) amended its guidance on safety requirements during flying displays to \"strongly recommend\" that walk-throughs were \"adopted as a standard part of all formation briefings\". A spokeswoman for IWM Duxford said it was a \"minor incident\" and that the AAIB's recommendations had been \"incorporated into Imperial War Museum air show preparations\".",

The top deck of the Boeing 747 has been moved from the Cotswolds to take up residence at Salford's City Airport. It has been saved from the scrap-heap and brought to the city by self-confessed \"aviation geek\" Drew Hanna.  He said he had saved it \"for people to enjoy\" because they were \"sad when the 747s were being scrapped\". British Airways retired all 31 of its jumbo jets in 2020. Mr Hanna, who transforms old airplane parts into airline memorabilia, first got the idea of buying part of one of the planes during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Having worked in aviation all his life, the 34-year-old from Salford said he wanted to turn his \"passion for all things aviation\" into a business. After developing an online shop selling upcycled aircraft items, he said he could not resist the chance to buy part of a 747 when the opportunity arose. \"We already worked with scrappers,\" he said. \"This was the last 747 and I didn't want to see it crushed into cans.\" He used his own money and some sourced from crowdfunding to pay for it to be moved from Kemble in the Cotswolds to Salford. Its journey saw it take to the M5, M6, M56 and M60 before it arrived at its final destination. It will now have a new life at City Airport Barton in Greater Manchester as The Deck 747, a tourist attraction which will act both as an educational resource and a flight simulator.

The jumbo jets are from a defunct cargo company and the court handling the bankruptcy had been trying to sell them for years. Six previous offline auctions failed and so the planes were eventually put up online.  Highest bidder and new proud owner is Chinese carrier SF Airlines, beating out 25 other interested parties. Taobao is an online auction website similar to eBay, owned by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.  The planes have been in storage in the cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen since 2013, after their owner, Jade Cargo International, filed for bankruptcy in September that year.  They were seized by a court in the southern city of Shenzhen which since then had been looking for a buyer. Ever wanted to own your own Boeing 747 and worried you missed your chance? Fret not, there's another freighter on offer which wasn't sold.  According to Chinese news agency Xinhua, the third jet could not be sold because there was only one buyer who'd registered for the auction. It's not the first time in fact that online auction sites sell somewhat unusual items for millions of dollars.

            "text": "Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 was shot down \"unintentionally\" shortly after taking off from Iran's capital on Wednesday, Iran says. All 176 passengers and crew were killed, including 57 Canadian citizens. The plane was bound for the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and many on board had a connecting flight to Toronto, Canada's largest city and a transit hub.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said that, all told, 138 people on that flight were en route to Canada.  Canada is home to a large Iranian diaspora, with some 210,000 citizens of Iranian descent, according to the latest federal census.  The country is also a popular destination for Iranian graduate and postdoctoral students to study and conduct research abroad, which is why many students were on the flight, returning to university following the winter break.  There is also no direct flight between Canada and Iran, and the Ukraine International Airlines flight from Tehran to Kiev and then to Toronto is popular because it is one of the most affordable options for the journey.  Other victims of the crash included 82 Iranians and 11 Ukrainians, as well as nationals from Sweden, the UK, Afghanistan and Germany. This is not the first air disaster that has touched Canada recently. Last year, 18 Canadians were killed when an Ethiopian Airlines flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi that crashed in March.  They were newlyweds, families, students, professionals and academics. Sixty-three of them were Canadian nationals, but many more called Canada their home, at least temporarily. They lived in cities like Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Winnipeg, Ottawa and Edmonton, making this a truly national tragedy.  Many were in the 20s and 30s, but a number of young children were also on board.  At least two families died: Ardalan Ebnoddin Hamidi, Niloofar Razzaghi and their teenage son Kamyar, from Vancouver; and Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand, and their daughters Daria and Dorina Mousavi, from Edmonton.  There were numerous foreign students on board as well, like Ghanimat Azhdari - a PhD student at the University of Guelph, Ontario, who specialised in promoting the rights of indigenous groups. Why were so many Canadians on doomed Iran plane? Tributes were held across the country on Wednesday night, and many more are planned in the coming days.  In Toronto, a public vigil organised by the Iranian Canadian Congress was attended by over 100 people on Thursday. Flags will be lowered at city hall until Monday.  Another vigil was hosted on Parliament Hill in the Canadian capital of Ottawa, and attended by the prime minister. On Friday, he is meeting with family members of the victims of the plane crash.  Ukraine's embassy in Canada has invited the public to sign a book of condolences.  In Edmonton, Alberta, members of the Iranian-Canadian community estimate about 30 people who lived in the city were on flight PS752.  A memorial for Sunday is being organised by an Iranian heritage group, an Iranian student association, and the University of Alberta, an institution that lost a number of its faculty members and students in the crash.  In fact, the deaths have cast a pall over university campuses across the country. Many of the deceased are being remembered as accomplished teachers, students and mentors with bright futures who were studying and working at institutions of higher learning across the country. ",

            "title": "European regulator says Boeing's 737 Max is safe",
            "text": "The head of Europe's aviation safety agency, EASA, has told the BBC he is \"certain\" Boeing's 737 Max is now safe to fly. Executive Director Patrick Ky said his organisation had \"left no stone unturned\" in its review of the aircraft and its analysis of design changes made by the manufacturer. The plane was grounded in March 2019. That was after it was involved in two catastrophic accidents, in which a total of 346 people died. It has already been cleared to resume flights in the US and Brazil. EASA expects to give permission for it to return to service in Europe in mid-January. The plane's first accident occurred in October 2018, when a Lion Air jet came down in the sea off Indonesia.  The second involved an Ethiopian Airlines version that crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, just four months later. Both have been attributed to flawed flight control software, which became active at the wrong time and prompted the aircraft to go into a catastrophic dive. Since the Ethiopian crash, EASA has been carrying out a root-and-branch review of the 737 Max's design, independently from a similar process undertaken by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The review, says Mr Ky, went well beyond the immediate causes of the two accidents and the modifications proposed by Boeing. \"We went further and reviewed all the flight controls, all the machinery of the aircraft\", he explains. The aim, he says, was to look at anything which could cause a critical failure.  In order to return to service, existing planes will now have to be equipped with new computer software, as well as undergoing changes to their wiring and cockpit instrumentation.  Pilots will need to undergo mandatory training, and each plane will have to undergo a test flight to ensure the changes have been carried out correctly.  US regulators have set out similar conditions. As a result, Mr Ky insists, \"We are very confident that it is now a very safe aircraft.\" Most of the initial safety certification work on the 737 Max was carried out by the FAA, and simply endorsed by EASA under the terms of a long-standing international agreement. But with the FAA now facing intense criticism for allowing an apparently flawed aircraft into service, Mr Ky says in future, things will be done differently. \"What is certain is that there were lessons learned from this, which will trigger new actions from our side\", he explains. In particular, where EASA is not the primary authority carrying out safety work, it will examine other people's decisions much more closely. \"We will perform our own safety assessment, which is going to be much more comprehensive than it used to be\", he says. But have regulators lost credibility and public confidence since the disasters? \"I hope not\", says Mr Ky. \"I think we have made a lot of progress in assessing what went wrong and what can be made better \"I hope the public trusts in us when we say we think, we are certain, that the aircraft is safe to fly\".",

            "title": "JetBlue to launch NY-UK flights despite pandemic",
            "text": "JetBlue has said the Covid pandemic will not stop the airline from launching its long-awaited New York to London service on Wednesday. Chief executive Robin Hayes told the BBC there was \"strong demand\" for the route in the US where, he said, JetBlue had returned to 2019 levels. The move comes as the global travel industry continues to recover. Holiday Inn-owner Intercontinental Hotels said holiday demand was \"returning strongly\". In its latest results statement, Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG), whose other brands include the Crowne Plaza chain, said it had opened 132 hotels during the January-to-June period and acquired another 203, both sizeable increases on last year. \"Trading improved significantly during the first half of 2021, with travel demand returning strongly as vaccines roll out, restrictions ease and economic activity rebuilds,\" said IHG chief executive Keith Barr. \"It has been great to see our teams welcome more and more guests back into our hotels, with domestic leisure bookings leading the way, particularly in the US and China.\" Measured on revenue per available room, nearly half of the group's hotels worldwide were above 2019 levels in July, it said. JetBlue's first transatlantic flight will leave New York's JFK airport on Wednesday evening and will land at London's Heathrow. Flights to London Gatwick will begin on 29 September. However, travelling on the route does not come cheap, at least to start with. JetBlue's website no longer has seats available for that inaugural flight, but prices for the next few days start at $941 (\u00a3679) one-way. That is still slightly cheaper than British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, which are both quoting a price of $980 for the same time period. Thanks to the likes of those established competitors, there are already as many as 28 flights a day available between London and New York. And other carriers have come a cropper on the same route, including Norwegian Air, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2020 after failing to make its low-cost strategy pay. However, JetBlue will be cutting costs by using smaller aircraft, relying on the single-aisle Airbus A321LR, rather than the Boeing 787 Dreamliners that were favoured by Norwegian. And for those who can book further in advance, it is pledging to offer return fares of less than $600. The airline's Mr Hayes said it had wanted to offer a New York-to-London service for a long time and flights were now \"ready to go\". He said JetBlue wanted to have \"a disruptive and permanent effect\" on the market. US-based travellers are now welcome to fly to the UK without having to quarantine on arrival if they have been fully vaccinated, but there is still a travel ban on people from the UK flying to the US.  The White House said at the end of last month that it did not intend to lift Covid-19 travel restrictions for non-Americans. Asked about this, Mr Hayes said JetBlue had made its views clear about the restrictions and that the current approach was \"not risk-based\".",

            "text": "Australian airline Qantas has grounded one of its Boeing 737 NG planes after discovering \"cracking\" in one section. The carrier said several airlines were inspecting their 737 NG fleets after Boeing revealed an area near the wing may be prone to cracking. News agency AFP reported up to 50 planes globally had been grounded due to the issue. Qantas said: \"Even when a crack is present, it does not immediately compromise the safety of the aircraft. \"We would never operate an aircraft unless it was completely safe to do so.\" Boeing said cracks had been found in the \"pickle fork\" - a section of the plane which helps attach the wing. Last month, US regulators ordered checks of all 737 NG planes which had undertaken more than 30,000 flights. Qantas said none of its 737 NG fleet had been flown more than 30,000 times. It added the plane with a crack had made fewer than 27,000 journeys. The issue comes after Boeing was forced to ground its newer 737 Max model in March, following two fatal crashes.  Those tragedies - in Indonesia last October, and in Ethiopia in March - killed a total of 346 people. On Wednesday, Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg told US lawmakers the firm had made mistakes in relation to the 737 Max fleet. Legislators had accused Boeing of rushing the approval process. The 737 NG is a precursor to the 737 Max. Qantas said it would inspect 33 planes in its fleet for the same issue by Friday. It did not respond to a report that a crack had been found in a second plane. The Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association, an aviation union, called for Qantas to ground its entire 737 NG fleet - a call rejected by the airline as \"alarmist\". US carrier Southwest Airlines recently discovered a crack in one of its 737 NG planes.",

            "title": "Pandemic-hit airline industry to regroup at Dubai Airshow",
            "text": "The Dubai Airshow, the largest aviation trade event to be held since the pandemic, will kick off in Dubai on Sunday.  Two major European shows - the Paris Airshow in Le Bourget in 2021 and Britain's Farnborough International Airshow in 2020 - were cancelled, making this an opportunity for the aerospace industry to get together after two challenging years.  The biennial Dubai Airshow is famous for record-breaking, multi-billion-dollar commercial aircraft deals signed between airlines and manufacturers but this year's edition is expected to be different.  The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is not expecting \"much in terms of large aircraft orders\" at the upcoming Dubai Airshow. \"I'm not aware of any major announcements that are likely to be made and certainly the CEOs that I've spoken to have taken a cautious approach,\" Willie Walsh, Director-General of IATA said during a media briefing last week. The event comes at a time when the financially battered airline industry is starting to emerge from the pandemic, looking to rebuild flight networks and review fleet plans - as they phase out older, less fuel-efficient aircraft. The show will also see a significant attendance of defence firms with 20 countries, including Brazil, Russia, France and Israel, setting up their own country pavilions. According to organisers, the event will feature 1,200 exhibitors, and at least 160 commercial and military aircraft will be on display on the tarmac. Much of the attention will be on Boeing's much-delayed 777X jet, which is making its international debut during the event. The aircraft was originally expected to go into service in 2019, but has been hit with several delays, causing the manufacturer to slide the date to late 2023 at the earliest. Dubai-based Emirates, which is the launch customer, has repeatedly lambasted Boeing over the delay of the twin-engine jumbo. Last month, it warned that the uncertainty would cause significant disruption for one of the world's biggest carriers. Emirates' President Sir Tim Clark said that he did not know when the first of the 777X jets Emirates had ordered would arrive. Boeing and Emirates will be holding talks during the course of the event regarding the delivery of the aircraft. Emirates had placed the mega order for 777X jets along with 30 of the 787 Dreamliner wide-body jets as part of its strategy to replace the current 777 jets that are the backbone of its wide-body fleet. But it is now considering exchanging some of its 777X jets on order for smaller 787 Dreamliners amid delays in the new aircraft's debut, the airline's chief executive, Sheikh Ahmed, had said in May. Emirates is not the first client looking to cut down on its initial order. The delay in rolling out the aircraft has hurt Boeing, with its 777X order tally falling from 309 in 2019 to 191 a year later. Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific had also placed orders for the aircraft.  The 777X will be the world's largest and most efficient twin-engine jet, delivering 10% better fuel use, emissions and operating costs compared to its competitors, according to Boeing. The aerospace trade show also comes amid rising oil prices, with prices hovering above $80 per barrel, adding more challenges for the airline industry. Aviation fuel makes up around a quarter of an airline's cost. Analysts warn that the constant rise in oil prices could impede the recovery for carriers, as they try to come out of the woods.",

            "text": "If your ambition is to fly into space - and you've got plenty of spare cash - then 2020 could be an exciting year. If space travel is not really your thing, but you would like a much bigger screen on your mobile phone, then 2020 might also have some tech for you. But if you think there are already too many phones out there and the technology industry needs to be less wasteful, well some tech companies might catch up with your thinking. Here's a little taster of what might be coming in the next twelve months. 2020 is going to be a \"pivotal year\" for space travel, according to Guy Norris, a senior editor at Aviation Week & Space Technology. Since Nasa retired the Space Shuttle in 2011, the US has relied on Russian spacecraft to transport astronauts to the International Space Station.  That could all change in 2020 when, if all goes to plan, two US-built spacecraft should start carrying crew. Boeing's CST-100 Starliner, which can carry up to seven astronauts into orbit, is due for its first test flight today before the first manned flight, likely to be in 2020. Meanwhile the SpaceX Dragon capsule will go through some final tests in early 2020, and if they all go well then it too would be ready for a crewed mission. Other systems, designed to reach near-Earth space, could also reach milestones in 2020. Blue Origin, owned by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, could be ready to take tourists on its New Shepard suborbital rocket.  Virgin Galactic could also be ready in 2020 to take passengers into space, more than a decade later than founder Richard Branson originally hoped. It's reported that more than 600 people have put down deposits for a Virgin Galactic flight, with tickets costing $250,000 (\u00a3195,000). \"It's finally delivery time for a lot of these long promised programmes and a chance for a whole range of technologies to really prove themselves for the first time,\" says Mr Norris. More Technology of Business Protests by Extinction Rebellion have helped move climate change up the agenda for technology companies.  Among those that will be under pressure are mobile phone makers. It's estimated there are 18 billion phones lying around unused worldwide. With around 1.3 billion phones sold in 2019, that number is growing all the time. Mobile phone makers will be under pressure to make their production processes greener and their phones more easily repairable. The same will go for the makers of other consumer goods including TVs, washing machines and vacuum cleaners. Also watch the companies that provide mobile phone services. Vodafone has already promised that in the UK by 2023 its networks will all run on sustainable energy sources. Others are likely to follow suit. Business travel is under pressure as well. Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight says it will become \"socially unacceptable\" to fly around the world for meetings and firms will switch to virtual meetings. There could also be green initiatives from the cloud computing industry as well. Their facilities which house thousands of computer servers use huge amounts of power. The launch of Samsung's first foldable phone in April did not go smoothly. Several reviewers broke the screens and the company had to make some rapid improvements before it went on sale in September. Motorola had a more successful launch of its new Razr, although some reviewers complained about the price. But this is unlikely to hold the market back. Samsung is expected to launch other devices with flexible displays next year - possibly a tablet.  TCL, the second biggest maker of TVs in China, has also promised to launch its first mobile foldable device in 2020 and then other products quickly after that. It is betting big on the market, having invested $5.5bn in developing flexible displays. Analysts say that screens will be incorporated into all sorts of surfaces. Smart speakers might have wrap-around displays, watch-like devices will have straps with displays and fridge doors might have large screens. We can expect the rollout of high-speed mobile phone networks to continue. By the end of 2019 around 40 networks in 22 countries were offering 5G service. By the end of 2020 that number will have more than doubled to to around 125 operators, says Kester Mann at CCS Insight. \"There could be an interesting development in the way 5G contracts are priced. A 5G contract without a phone will cost around \u00a330 a month and for that you're likely to get unlimited amounts of data.\" But analysts say that next year we may see prices based on the speed of the service you want - a bit like the way home broadband is already priced. Vodafone is already offering contracts based on speed in the UK. Also in the UK, the network 3 is likely to push its 5G offering as an alternative to broadband at home, analysts say. That might appeal to people who move around a lot - students for example - and don't want a fixed line service. Will next year be another big one for quantum computing; the technology which exploits the baffling but powerful behaviour of tiny particles such as electrons and photons? In October Google said that its quantum computer had performed a task in 200 seconds, that the fastest supercomputer would have taken 10,000 years to complete. There was some quibbling over its achievement, but experts say it was a big moment. \"It's a fantastic milestone,\" says Philipp Gerbert, a member of the deep tech group at consultancy firm BCG:  \"It's clear they exceeded the classical computer, by what margin you can debate. They disproved some lingering doubts.\" Mr Gerbert thinks other leaders in the field - IBM, Rigetti and IonQ - could also clear that hurdle: \"They all have excellent teams, one or two will reach a similar stage over the next year.\"  Once the technology is proven, quantum computers could spur breakthroughs in chemistry, pharmaceuticals and engineering. Google has also promised to make its quantum computer available for use by outsiders in 2020, but has not provided any details yet. \"Clearly people would love to get access to that,\" Mr Gerbert says.",

            "text": "A Ryanair plane has been seized by French authorities in a row over money in the latest problem for the airline.  The French civil aviation authority grounded the Boeing 737 on Thursday at Bordeaux airport, before it was due to fly to Stansted with 149 passengers. It said the move was \"a last resort\". The dispute was caused by French subsidies paid to Ryanair for flights from Angoul\u00eame regional airport between 2008 and 2009, which the European Commission later deemed illegal. The French civil aviation authority did not say how much money was involved, but regional airport officials said the sum was \u20ac525,000 (\u00a3457,000). The authority said the plane \"will remain immobilised until the sum is paid\". \"It is unfortunate that the state had to take such action, which led to the inevitable inconvenience of the 149 passengers on board the immobilised plane,\" the French civil aviation authority said. \"Those passengers were able to eventually reach their destination later that evening on another Ryanair plane, but with a five-hour delay.\" It is the latest in a series of setbacks for Ryanair, which has recently faced a series of strikes by pilots and cabin crew across Europe. But despite flight cancellations, Ryanair reported an 11% rise in traffic in October, as it carried 13.1 million passengers. The stoppages contributed to a 7% fall in profits to \u20ac1.2bn (\u00a31.06bn) for the six months to 30 September.",

The Lockheed C-130 transport aircraft was carrying 96 people, mostly troops, when it overshot a runway at Jolo airport in Sulu province on Sunday. The soldiers were among reinforcements sent to combat Islamist militants such as the Abu Sayyaf group. The dead are mainly military personnel, but three civilians on the ground were also killed, the defence ministry said. Five people were initially listed as missing, but all passengers on board have now been accounted for.  A spokesperson from the Armed Forces of the Philippines told news site ABS-CBN that they were looking for the flight data recorder to find out why exactly the plane crashed.  Major Gen Edgard Arevalo said there was no sign of any attack on the plane. The plane, which came down at 11:30 local time (03:30 GMT) a few kilometres from the town of Jolo, was carrying troops from Cagayan de Oro, on the southern island of Mindanao.  \"It missed the runway, trying to regain power but it didn't make it,\" armed forces chief Gen Sobejana told reporters.  A statement from the regional military force, Joint Task Force Sulu, said \"a number of soldiers were seen jumping out of the aircraft before it hit the ground, sparing them from the explosion caused by the crash\".  No details about how they managed to get out of the plane or their condition were given. Many of those on board had only recently completed basic military training, AFP reports.  The plane, previously in service with the US Air Force, was handed to the Philippines in January. It was the first of two used Hercules to be delivered by the US under a defence co-operation scheme.  The aircraft first flew in 1988, according to Aviation Safety Network.",

            "text": "A new fleet of surveillance aircraft is to be based at RAF Lossiemouth, it has been announced. The Wedgetail aircraft will be based alongside submarine-hunting planes and fighter jets at the Moray base. The fleet will begin to arrive in 2023, although no decision has been taken yet on how many aircraft that will mean. The Wedgetails will carry advanced battle-management technology allowing those on board to track other aircraft and ships over land and sea. The base has seen major investment in recent years, including a runway upgrade. It is hoped the Wedgetail announcement could lead to further investment, as well as military and civilian jobs. The E-7 Wedgetail surveillance aircraft are based on Boeing 737s, as are the Poseidon P8s already on site at RAF Lossiemouth. Defence Minister Baroness Goldie said: \"Scotland's proximity to the waters and skies of the North Atlantic is of crucial importance to the UK's and Nato's security - this is why important military bases such as HMNB Clyde and RAF Lossiemouth are located here. \"The decision to base the E-7 Wedgetail at RAF Lossiemouth demonstrates our commitment to investing in Scotland, and will complement and expand upon the success of Typhoon fast jet and submarine hunting Poseidon operations.\"",

            "text": "The failure of Europe's biggest regional airline Flybe could be the start of more casualties, analysts predict. On Thursday, a global airline industry body warned the financial hit from coronavirus could reach $113bn (\u00a387bn) this year. The bleak prediction came on the same day UK-based Flybe went into administration. Airline experts are forecasting more failures as passengers cancel flights. Flybe's collapse \"will likely be the first of many in 2020,\" said James Goodall, transport analyst at Redburn. \"We expect that the demand destruction caused by Covid-19 accelerated its demise and we believe further airline bankruptcies should be expected in the coming months.\" Airlines could lose $63bn to $113bn in revenue from the slump in passenger traffic globally this year, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Thursday.  Last month, it had predicted losses of $29bn.  Demand has plummeted, not just from holidaymakers, but from corporate travel as firms restrict business trips for employees and conferences are postponed. \"There will be a significant increase in airline casualties in this scenario,\" said Michael Duff, managing director at The Airline Analyst. Mr Duff singled out a handful of airlines based in China, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, Norway and Mexico that rate very low on his firm's financial strength index. \"This is a very difficult time for the airline industry and it will be about conserving cash,\" said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor of Flightglobal magazine. \"It will be a very challenging time for those airlines who don't have a lot of cash, especially those that have been involved in a price war.\"  Analysts said regional airlines in Asia were more vulnerable as they rely heavily on passengers from China, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. \"They also have some of the largest aircraft order backlogs so we can expect some pressure on Airbus and Boeing to delay deliveries and to refund aircraft deposits,\" added Mr Duff. Many airlines have introduced cost-cutting measures such as asking staff to take unpaid leave and pay cuts as planes are grounded. Emirates has asked workers to take unpaid leave for up to one month, while Cathay Pacific asked staff to take three weeks of unpaid leave.  Regional airline Flybe went into administration on Thursday after a bid for fresh funding failed.  Paul Charles, a former director of Virgin Atlantic, told the BBC's Today programme that he expected \"other casualties\" due to pressures such as the coronavirus. \"You're going to see massive consolidation within six months' time,\" he said. \"Management teams at airlines at the moment are entirely stretched because of coronavirus. You're not going to see anyone else come in and try and replenish the network or fill the void left by Flybe.\" Scottish airline Loganair has said it will take on 16 former Flybe routes. But Mr Charles said: \"What Loganair is doing is cherry-picking the best routes, which does make sense, but I wonder how long it's going to last - I do think some of those 16 won't survive for several months.\" However, Loganair chief executive Jonathan Hinkles said he disagreed, and that other airlines would buy some of the routes. \"I'm aware from friends and former colleagues in the Channel Islands that they'll be stepping up today to announce some former Flybe routes as well. \"I think airlines will be stepping up where it makes sense.\" BBC Business reporter Tom Espiner contributed to this article.",

            "title": "Work on production line of Boeing 737 Max \u2018not adequately funded\u2019",
            "text": "A former Boeing engineer has told the BBC's Panorama programme that work on the production line of the 737 Max plane was not adequately funded. The aircraft is currently grounded after two crashes which killed 346 people. The 737 Max is the company's fastest selling plane and has earned the company billions of dollars in sales. Boeing denies the claims and says it's committed to making the 737 Max one of the safest aircraft ever to fly. Adam Dickson worked at Boeing for 30 years and led a team of engineers who worked on the 737 Max.  He said they were under constant pressure to keep costs down. \"Certainly what I saw was a lack of sufficient resources to do the job in its entirety,\" he says. \"The culture was very cost centred, incredibly pressurised. Engineers were given targets to get certain amount of cost out of the aeroplane.\" Mr Dickson said engineers were under pressure to downplay new features on the 737 Max. He said by classifying them as minor rather than major changes, Boeing would face less scrutiny from the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration. \"The goal was to show that those differences were so similar to the previous design that it would not require a major design classification in the certification process. There was a lot of interest and pressure on the certification and analysis engineers in particular, to look at any changes to the Max as minor changes.\" He said that downplaying the changes reduced scrutiny in a way that could impact safety. Now even his own family have fears about the plane's safety.  \"My family won't fly on a 737 Max. It's frightening to see such a major incident because of a system that didn't function properly or accurately.\" Boeing said its former engineer's comments were incorrect. \"We did not cut corners or push the 737 Max out before it was ready,\" it said.  \"We have always held true to our values of safety, quality and integrity and those values are complementary and mutually reinforcing with productivity and company performance.\" Passengers first flew on the 737 Max in 2017, but airlines have been making advance purchases since the plane was first marketed in 2011  Five thousand have been ordered - making it the fastest-selling plane in Boeing's history.  Some of the money from those sales has been used to fund big pay-outs for company executives and shareholders.  Since 2013, Boeing has paid $17bn (\u00a313.74bn) in dividends to shareholders and has spent a further $43bn buying its own shares - a spending spree that has helped Boeing treble its share price in just five years. Chief executive Dennis Muilenburg has also been paid more than $70m. Critics have accused Boeing of paying more attention to the stock market than the safety of its passengers. Economist William Lazonick said senior management were too focused on making money. \"If you supercharge the incentives of top executives and tell them that their job is to get the stock price up, they're not going to pay the kind of attention they need to pay to ensuring they produce a safe plane,\" he said. Boeing said it \"follows a balanced cash deployment strategy that ensures investment in our core businesses and workforce, returns value to shareholders and maintains our strong balance sheet and credit rating\". The 737 Max has been grounded since March and there is currently no sign of regulators allowing the plane back in the skies. Boeing has been trying to fix the software that forced the aircraft in Indonesia and Ethiopia down. MCAS was designed to operate when the plane was flying at a steep, nose-up angle - and would automatically attempt to move the nose downwards.  It was meant to make the controls feel more predictable and familiar to pilots who were used to older versions of the 737. But pilots didn't know about MCAS because it wasn't included in training materials or the 1,600-page manual for the Max. Boeing's system also had a fatal flaw - it used a single sensor to work out the angle the plane was flying at.  On both the Indonesian and Ethiopian flights, that sensor stopped working properly.  This resulted in MCAS forcing the aircraft downwards even though they were already on the correct course. The pilots struggled to regain control, because MCAS was designed to kick back in every few seconds. The Indonesian plane was forced down more than 20 times before it crashed. Boeing said it wasn't relying on the single sensor, because the pilots were there as back up. It said there was a way to override MCAS - a standard procedure that pilots should have known about from flying the old 737. The company has said the pilots didn't completely follow the correct operating procedures when things went wrong. But 737 pilots like Chris Brady say it is wrong to blame the pilots. \"If you're going to design and certify an airliner with such a complicated, obscure failure mode as happened to that crew, it's no wonder that your average crew aren't able to deal with it,\" he said. Boeing said it is focusing on implementing the software update, finalising pilot training and rebuilding trust with customers. \"Boeing truly regrets the loss of life and will continue to work with communities, customers and the aviation industry to help with the healing process,\" it said. \"In any accident we must learn from what happened.  It's also important to avoid speculating ahead of the final investigative reports.\" Watch BBC Panorama: Boeing's Killer Planes, on 29 July at 8.30pm on BBC One.",

The specially-outfitted Boeing 787 Dreamliner was purchased in 2012, at the start of the presidency of his predecessor Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.  Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador has described the plane as a symbol of government excess. He frequently uses commercial flights to travel across Mexico. An initial plan to raffle off the plane itself faced widespread mockery as people questioned what ordinary Mexicans could do with such an aircraft. The luxurious jet has been reconfigured to fly only 80 people, has a large \"presidential suite\" and a private bath. Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador has now decided to give 100 winning ticket holders $1 million (\u00a3773,000). The government hopes to raise about $160 million from 6m ticket sales.  The remaining money will be used to buy medical equipment for public hospitals and ensure the plane is kept in flight condition while the president tries to sell or rent it.  Raffle tickets will cost about 500 pesos ($26; \u00a320) and the winners will be announced on 15 September, the day before Mexican Independence Day. The president had previously pledged to use profits from the sale of the plane to fund efforts to curb illegal migration.",

            "text": "Airbus plans to ramp up production, saying it sees a recovery to pre-pandemic levels of demand by 2025. The world's largest planemaker said it would increase output of its A320neo by more than 10%, from 40 planes a month to 45 by the end of this year. Airbus, which builds its wings in the UK, also set a new target of 64 planes a month by the second quarter of 2023. \"The aviation sector is beginning to recover from the Covid-19 crisis,\" said chief executive Guillaume Faury.  The move by Airbus comes at a time when airlines are still struggling to remain financially viable. Restrictions on international travel because of the coronavirus crisis have reduced flights to a bare minimum. Despite this, the planemaker is looking ahead. It says it expects the commercial aircraft market to recover to pre-Covid levels between 2023 and 2025, led by single-aisle aircraft, which typically carry 200-250 passengers and fly on shorter routes. Airbus said it would step up production of its A350 family of planes from five a month to six by autumn 2022.  It also envisages producing 14 of its A220 airliners every month within the next five years. The current monthly production rate is five, which Airbus said would increase to six early next year. However, A330 production would remain at an average of two a month. Airbus said it was \"protecting its ability to further adapt as the market evolves\". Mr Faury said: \"The message to our supplier community provides visibility to the entire industrial ecosystem to secure the necessary capabilities and be ready when market conditions call for it.  \"In parallel, we are transforming our industrial system by optimising our aerostructures set-up and modernising our A320 Family production facilities. All these actions are set in motion to prepare our future.\" Meanwhile, aircraft engine firm Rolls-Royce has opened the world's largest indoor aerospace testbed in Derby. The facility will allow it to perform development work on its next generation of engines, the UltraFan, expected to be 25% more efficient than current models. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who attended the opening ceremony, said the new testbed showed that the UK remained \"a global leader in aeroengine technology\".",

            "title": "Iran plane downing: How media responded to public anger",
            "text": "Outrage in Iran over the shooting down of a Ukrainian airliner, and the delay in admitting responsibility for it, has been prominent in its media. Sentiments normally seen in social media posts have made their way into more mainstream outlets that normally toe the line. There has been an acknowledgement that people have a right to be angry. Immediately after the crash on 8 January, state media and the press vehemently denied the military's involvement in the incident, blaming it on \"technical issues\". After the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) admitted three days later that they had shot down the plane, protests broke out in Tehran and other cities. In response, outlets that would normally cast such events as \"seditious\" behaviour, and claim that they are being incited or exploited by foreign powers, took a different tone. The normally partisan Fars news agency, which is linked to the IRGC, published unusually frank and detailed reports of the protests. It reported slogans criticising the IRGC and officials and even quoted the \"death to the dictator\" slogan, a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  A video accompanying one report showed protesters tearing down a poster of Qasem Soleimani, the IRGC commander killed in a US air strike in Baghdad at the start of the year.  Iran conducted missile strikes on US forces to avenge Soleimani's death, and it was amid the heightened tensions shortly after the strikes that the plane was hit.  Fars also quoted the protesters calling themselves \"fighters\".  This is unusual. When protests took place in November over fuel prices, Fars's descriptions of protesters were based on what figures of authority called them. \"Thugs and rioters\" and \"anarchist movements\" were examples.   A number of news agencies and newspapers have also apologised to their users and blamed officials for misinforming them.  \"We at the Islamic Republic of Iran News Agency apologise if, during the past three days, we unintentionally conveyed untrue content to our audience,\" the official state agency said.  Similar messages were carried on the front pages of major newspapers. Several journalists also complained that their reputations had been damaged. \"Almost all our media outlets feel their credibility has unfortunately been ruined,\" said one presenter on Iran's rolling news channel. He warned people would be pushed towards foreign media to get their news, especially in a crisis. Tehran's Association of Journalists put it in stronger terms.  \"We are holding a funeral for public trust. The first coffins include the corpses of the official media, especially [of the state broadcaster] Voice and Vision, and then other newspapers and websites.\"  A handful of journalists from Iran's state broadcaster resigned in the wake of the IRGC taking responsibility for the plane downing.  \"It was very hard for me to believe that our people have been killed. Forgive me that I got to know this late. And forgive me for the 13 years I told you lies,\" said presenter Gelare Habbasi on her Instagram account.    Channel One's Zahra Khatami-Rad vowed: \"I will never return to television.\" Many Iranian celebrities have also used their Instagram accounts to criticise the authorities for their slowness in taking responsibility for the crash, with musicians cancelling concerts and those in the film industry pulling out of the forthcoming International Fajr Film Festival. Popular actor Hamed Behdad said the protests were a \"turning point\" and called on officials to \"put an end to fabricating lies\".  \"We are not citizens, have never been. We are prisoners, millions of prisoners,\" wrote another actor, Taraneh Alidoosti.   The unusual tone in many Iranian outlets this week is unlikely to translate into a fundamental overhaul of the country's media practices, however. Despite the resignations of some of its journalists, the state broadcaster, whose chief is chosen by Ayatollah Khamenei, has so far shown no major change in its news reporting.  While state TV channels expressed sympathy with the families of the crash victims, they also said several \"seditionists\" and foreign-based Persian-language TV channels were trying to \"hijack\" people's demands and emotions. After the videos of attacks on Soleimani posters emerged, state radio reminded its audiences of the IRGC's role in \"safeguarding\" the country's security and borders, and stressed that an \"unintentional mistake\" should not lead to an attack on the Guards. This week, Iran said it had arrested a person who filmed footage of the plane being shot down by a missile. Video of the plane being hit was used by a number of open source investigation teams to verify why the plane crashed.

She added that \"the government must consider stepping in and taking an equity stake to avoid this crisis\". BBC business editor Simon Jack reported on Saturday that government sources had questioned the financial wisdom of stepping in to save the company. He said the government did not see its options as being between spending \u00a3200m to help Thomas Cook with its cash shortfall or \u00a3600m to repatriate its British customers abroad. Currently there are 600,000 Thomas Cook customers on holiday, of which 150,000 to 160,000 are British. Chloe Hardy from Leicestershire is due to get married in Zante in October and booked the wedding package with Thomas Cook back in June 2018.  Chloe and her fiance will also have 33 family members flying out, with their trips costing more than \u00a333,000 in total.  With the big day looming, Chloe is frustrated by Thomas Cook's handling of their booking.  \"I have emailed the wedding concierge and co-ordinator, neither has got back to me. We are unsure if we will be able to fly. Although, it's Atol-protected I have booked three weeks' leave from work and there's no guarantee that I will be able to get time off if I had to rebook.\"  \"We've had constant questions from our family that we are unable to answer,\" she added. \"This is causing great concern, worry and stress to all of us involved.\" It comes after a noticeable shift in tone from Thomas Cook in its replies to concerned customers on social media. Clients had earlier been told to ignore media speculation on Friday, but are now being reminded they have Atol protection - a sort of industry-backed insurance - \"in the event that Thomas Cook goes into administration\". Thomas Cook, one of the world's largest travel companies, was founded in 1841 to operate temperance day trips, and now has annual sales of \u00a39bn. It employs 22,000 staff, 9,000 of those in the UK and serves 19 million customers a year in 16 different countries. Thomas Cook's financial difficulties have mounted over the past year, culminating with the agreement in August of a rescue deal led by its biggest shareholder Fosun. In July, Thomas Cook produced a business plan saying that it needed \u00a3900m in refinancing, up from a previous estimate of \u00a3150m. The \u00a3900m would come from Fosun, the group of creditors and some other investors. The group of lenders then commissioned an independent investigation. Its financial advisers said Thomas Cook would require an additional \u00a3200m on top of the \u00a3900m already required, which would bring the total refinancing needed up to \u00a31.1bn. Thomas Cook succeeded in finding a backer to provide the additional \u00a3200m, but the BBC understands it has since pulled out and the group of creditors will not come back to the table unless that additional funding is found. A final vote on that deal was due to take place this week, but it has been delayed until next Friday in the face of the latest demand for extra standby funding. Thomas Cook has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit. If you are on a package holiday you are covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol). The scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment. Atol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating. If you have holiday booked in the future you will also be refunded by the scheme. If you have booked a flight-only deal you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund. When Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.

            "title": "Sriwijaya Air crash: Indonesia divers search wreckage as black box hunt resumes",
            "text": "The Indonesian navy has released footage of divers searching through the wreckage of a passenger plane which crashed into the sea at the weekend as the hunt for its black boxes resumes.  Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737 left Jakarta with 62 people on board, but vanished from the radar on its way to Borneo island on Saturday. Search teams have found aircraft parts and human remains and believe they know where the black boxes are located. The first victim has been identified. Okky Bisma, a 29-year-old flight attendant on the plane, was identified by his fingerprints, officials said late on Monday. One official stressed the urgency of the search mission calling it a \"24-hour\" operation.  \"It's going to be an around-the-clock operation,\" Rasman MS, head of the search and rescue agency's crash operations told reporters.  \"There will be no breaks. The sooner we can find the victims, the better.\"  According to news wire AFP, some 2,600 personnel are currently involved in the search operation along with more than 50 ships and 13 aircraft. Divers have been recovering body parts, wreckage and passengers' clothing from waters about 23 metres (75ft) deep.  There appears to be no hope of finding any survivors. Navy chief of staff Yudo Margono said the search team had pinpointed the location of the black box cockpit voice and flight data recorders and a remote-controlled vehicle was being used to scan the sea bed. \"There is so much debris down there and we have only lifted a few pieces. Hopefully, as we take out more [the recorders] can be found,\" he told reporters. The fact the debris does not appear to have spread far suggests the plane may have been intact before it hit the water, an investigator with Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) told news agency Reuters. \"It possibly ruptured when it hit waters because if it had exploded mid-air, the debris would be distributed more widely,\" said Nurcahyo Utomo.  Investigators are already analysing items which they believe to be a wheel and part of the plane's fuselage. A turbine from one of its engines is also among the debris that has been recovered.  The Sriwijaya Air passenger plane departed from Jakarta's main airport at 14:36 local time (07:36 GMT) on Saturday. Minutes later, at 14:40, the last contact with the plane was recorded, with the call sign SJY182, according to the transport ministry. The usual flight time to Pontianak, in West Kalimantan province in the west of the island of Borneo, is 90 minutes. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. The plane is thought to have dropped more than 3,000m (10,000ft) in less than a minute, according to flight tracking website Flightradar24.com. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. The missing aircraft is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model that was grounded from March 2019 until last December following two deadly crashes. According to registration details, the plane was a 26-year-old Boeing 737-500. It was in good condition, Sriwijaya Air chief executive Jefferson Irwin Jauwena told reporters. Take-off had been delayed for 30 minutes due to heavy rain, he said. Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-east Asian destinations. The plane went missing about 20km (12 miles) north of the capital Jakarta, not far from where another flight crashed in October 2018. A total of 189 died when an Indonesian Lion Air flight plunged into the sea about 12 minutes after take-off from the city. That disaster was blamed on a series of failures in the plane's design, but also faults by the airline and the pilots. It was one of two crashes that led regulators to pull the Boeing 737 Max from service. The model resumed passenger flights in December after a systems overhaul.",

The United Airlines flight was forced to make an unscheduled landing in Anchorage on Thursday evening due to a \"passenger smearing faeces everywhere\". Police said the man, a US resident of Vietnamese origin, made no threats.

The passenger, a 22-year-old whose name has not been released, was co-operative and faced \"no appropriate charges for anything criminal\", Lt Gamache added.  The man, who made no threats and did not try to interfere with the flight crew, was handcuffed by police at Anchorage International Airport and escorted off the plane. Police told Anchorage TV station KTUU that he was taken to a hospital for a mental health assessment after being interviewed through a translator. United Airlines said in a statement that flight UA895 was carrying 245 people when it was diverted because of \"a disruptive passenger\". Hotel accommodation was provided for those on board, the statement added. ",

            "text": "The EU says it will act \"decisively\" if the US goes ahead with a threat to put new tariffs on its goods. It is latest twist in a long-running row with Washington over subsidies granted to the planemaker Airbus. For more than a decade, the EU and US have accused each other of propping up their home aviation markets with tax breaks, research grants and other aid. Last month, the US threatened duties on EU goods such as beer, gin and olives, escalating the row. On Monday, Europe's trade commissioner Phil Hogan said Washington had rejected moves to settle the dispute. \"I want to reassure people that we are ready to act decisively and strongly on the European Union side if we don't get the type of outcome that we expect from the United States in relationship to finalising this 15-year-old dispute,\" he told the European Parliament's trade committee.  The World Trade Organization (WTO) has already ruled that subsidies given by the EU to Airbus in 2004 were illegal. However, it is also considering a parallel case involving illegal support for US aerospace firm Boeing, which could see the EU impose duties on Washington later this year. In line with the WTO ruling, the US last year imposed tariffs of 15-25% on $7.5bn (\u00a36bn) worth of European goods.  But in June, the US said it was considering new taxes on additional EU trade worth $3.1bn annually - a move described as excessive by Brussels. On Monday, Mr Hogan also criticised recent national security investigations launched by the US against EU goods, suggesting they may also be a form of retaliation.  The investigations, known as 232 investigations, cover products from transformers and mobile cranes to steel nails.  \"It's not appreciated the number of 232 investigations that have been launched in recent weeks, perhaps this is political, perhaps it's more real,\" Mr Hogan said. \"This is totally unacceptable,\" he said. \"If these investigations go further, the European Union will have to stand together and act as well.\" The US is also involved in other trade spats with the EU.  Before last year's tariffs over Airbus, the Trump administration had imposed duties on EU steel and aluminium - spurring Brussels to tax iconic US products such as denim jeans and motorcycles. Mr Trump has also threatened duties on European cars, a particular concern to Germany. ",

            "title": "US plane scatters engine debris over Denver homes",
            "text": "A Boeing jet has scattered debris over a residential area near Denver after one of its engines failed on take-off.  The Boeing 777, with 231 passengers and 10 crew on board, was able to return safely and land at Denver airport. No injuries were reported.  Police in the town of Broomfield posted pictures of what appears to be the front of an engine casing in the front garden of a home.   Passengers on board described a \"large explosion\" shortly after take-off.  Flight 328, a United Airlines plane bound for Honolulu, suffered a failure in its right-hand engine, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said.  One passenger who was on the flight told AP news agency that the pilot was giving an announcement when there was a loud explosion.  \"The plane started shaking violently, and we lost altitude and we started going down,\" David Delucia said.  He added that he and his wife placed their wallets in their pockets so that \"in case we did go down, we could be ID'd\".  Images posted online showed smoke trailing from the engine. One video apparently shot from inside the plane shows an engine on fire and stripped of its casing.  The incident happened shortly after 13:00 local time (20:00 GMT) on Saturday.  Broomfield police urged residents not to touch or move the debris. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will be carrying out an investigation.  One Broomfield resident told CNN he had seen the debris fall from the plane and took shelter with his children as it started coming down.  \"We saw it go over, we heard the big explosion, we looked up, there was black smoke in the sky,\" Kieran Cain said. \"Debris started raining down, which you know, sort of looked like it was floating down and not very heavy, but actually now looking at it, it's giant metal pieces all over the place.\"  It is unclear what caused the engine to catch fire. Jet engine failures do not happen often, but they can be caused by a rotating part, such as a turbine blade, breaking off and piercing the outer cowling. The plane, a Boeing 777-200, was manufactured 26 years ago.  On the same day as the Denver incident, an engine failure on a 30-year-old Boeing 747 freighter saw debris fall on a town in the Netherlands. Parts of what appeared to be turbine blades landed on the town of Meerssen. Two people on the ground, one a child, were slightly injured. The aircraft, which had left Maastricht bound for New York, landed safely in Liege in neighbouring Belgium.   ",

            "title": "737 Max crashes: Boeing says not guilty to fraud charge",
            "text": "Boeing has told a US court it was not guilty of concealing information about flight control systems on its 737 Max aircraft, which led to two crashes, killing 346 people.  Flaws in the systems were found to have led to the accidents, but Boeing avoided a trial by agreeing to pay $2.5bn (\u00a31.8bn). Now relatives of those who died are trying to reopen the settlement.  They are due to confront the aircraft giant in court. The hearing marks the first time Boeing has been forced to answer to the fraud charge in a public court, after the judge hearing the case ruled that those killed in the planes were legally \"crime victims\" and should have been involved in settlement negotiations.  Families of those who died say that the deal Boeing reached with the Department of Justice (DoJ) in 2021 to resolve a criminal conspiracy charge was a \"sweetheart agreement\" which violated their rights and allowed the company to avoid being held fully accountable.  The DoJ has defended its decision, insisting that the settlement was appropriate, because it could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was a direct connection between Boeing's alleged crimes and the two crashes. Boeing, which admitted responsibility as part of the deal, has opposed reopening the agreement, saying to do so would be \"unprecedented, unworkable and inequitable\". The firm declined to comment ahead of Thursday's hearing in Texas.  Mark Pegram, whose son Sam was working for a refugee agency when he died on the second plane that crashed, was unable to travel to Texas. But he said he was very glad the hearing was taking place. \"To us a fine and cover-up is not justice,\" he said.  \"It is important a precedent is set to prevent similar loss of innocent lives, and for Boeing to understand the horrific impact their misconduct has had on so many families,\" he added. In a court filing this week, the families asked the judge to appoint an independent monitor to oversee Boeing's compliance with the deal and require public disclosure of the firm's compliance efforts.   It is still not clear whether the legal action will ultimately lead to the deferred prosecution agreement between Boeing and the DoJ being reopened.  Such a move would be highly unusual. But according to Robert A Clifford, a Chicago lawyer representing the families in a separate civil action, it could have far-reaching consequences, including action against individuals. \"These families want the maximum penalty imposed against Boeing, and they want any immunity from prosecution that senior officials at Boeing received to be lifted,\" he said. It is nearly four years since Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 crashed minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa to Nairobi. 157 people died when it plunged into farmland outside the Ethiopian capital in March 2019. The accident involved a new design of aircraft - the 737 Max. Just months earlier, an almost identical aircraft operated by the Indonesian carrier Lion Air had crashed into the Java Sea on what should have been a routine flight from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang. 189 passengers and crew lost their lives. It later emerged that both accidents were triggered by design flaws, in particular the use of flight control software known as MCAS. The system was designed to assist pilots familiar with previous generations of the 737, and prevent them from needing costly extra training in order to fly the new model. But sensor failures caused it to malfunction, and in both cases it forced the aircraft into a catastrophic dive the pilots were unable to prevent.   Investigations in the US revealed that Boeing had not included information about the MCAS system in pilot manuals or training guidance, and had deliberately sought to downplay the impact of the system in its communications with the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration.  Boeing 737 Max aircraft were cleared to fly again in the US in 2020 and in the UK and EU in 2021, after being grounded in 2019 following the crashes. In January 2021, the US charged Boeing with fraud. But the company was able to avoid going on trial, by agreeing to pay $2.5bn, including $500m to the families of those killed, and promising to tighten up its compliance procedures. If the firm complies with the terms of the deal, the DoJ has agreed to drop the charge after three years.  This settlement - known as a deferred prosecution agreement - provoked intense anger among a number of the relatives of those who died aboard ET302.  There is no doubt that for the families, including those living in the UK, the arraignment hearing itself is a major milestone. Zipporah Kuria's father Joseph Wathaika was killed in the crash of ET302, and she has been a vocal campaigner for Boeing to be held to account ever since. She is in Texas for the hearing, and says her statement will be a tribute to an \"incredible\" man who changed many lives. \"It feels like we're finally being seen,\" she said. \"It feels like the death of our loved ones, of 346 people, at least has a level of relevance now.\"",

            "text": "The UK has \"no authority\" to impose tariffs as part of an aircraft subsidies row after leaving the EU, the US has said. The response comes after the UK said it would drop tariffs against the US over subsidies for aerospace firms. This was in a bid to reach a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. In November, the EU hit $4bn of US goods with duties of up to 25% in retaliation for illegal state aid given to American aerospace giant Boeing. Earlier this week the UK government said tariffs will be suspended in the UK from 1 January, when the current post-Brexit transition period ends. But the US responded saying the UK had no right to impose the tariffs anyway. The US Trade Representative said only the EU sued the US at the WTO, while the UK \"did not bring a case in its individual capacity.\" \"Therefore, the UK has no authority from the WTO to participate in any such action after it no longer is part of the EU.\" The tariffs, which were authorised by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), applied to a variety of imports from the US, including tractors, ketchup and orange juice.  Last year, the WTO said the US was justified in imposing its own tariffs on whisky, wine and cheese to pressure Europe to drop subsidies for plane maker Airbus.  The US has argued that it has the authority to impose those tariffs on the UK because it \"sued the EU as well as France, Germany, Spain, and the UK individually over massive subsidies to Airbus.\" \"As a result, the WTO authorized the US to impose countermeasures on each of those countries and the entire EU,\" it said. However, it said that a negotiated settlement \"best serves the interests of all parties\". \"In that regard, the US encourages the UK to bring renewed focus to settlement discussions,\" the Office of the US Trade Representative said. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said Britain's Department for International Trade had \"confirmed that we would be able to legally impose these tariffs outside of the EU\". The government is keen nevertheless to defuse the row as it seeks a post-Brexit trade deal with the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden.  \"We are serious about de-escalation and as a gesture of our determination to unlock a deal, we will be suspending retaliatory tariffs resulting from the Boeing dispute from January,\" the spokesman said.

            "text": "Boeing is to cut another 7,000 jobs as its losses mount in the pandemic. The US planemaker, which had already announced deep cuts, said its staff would be down to just 130,000 by the end of next year - 20% down on the 160,000 it employed before the crisis.  The coronavirus pandemic and safety concerns about its 737 Max jet have contributed to a slump in orders. The firm posted a loss of $466m (\u00a3354m) for the three months to 30 September, its fourth straight quarterly decline.  However, it reaffirmed its expectation that US deliveries of the 737 Max would resume before the end of the year, albeit at deeply reduced production rates. The fleet has been grounded since March 2019 after 346 people died in two separate air crashes.  The pandemic added to the crisis, causing a huge drop in air travel, pushing major airlines to the brink of bankruptcy and forcing them to cut staff and drop plans for new aircraft.   As a result, Boeing has slashed production and also cut jobs. The firm announced a 10% reduction this spring and warned of the likelihood of deeper cuts through attrition, buyouts and layoffs over the summer. It does not expect travel to return to pre-crisis levels until about 2023.  It said its revenues were down 30% in the first nine months of the year, at $42bn. Its third quarter loss, meanwhile, compares with a $1.2bn profit in the same period last year.  Boeing president and chief executive Dave Calhoun said the pandemic had \"continued to add pressure\" to the business . But he added: \"Our diverse portfolio, including our government services, defence and space programmes, continues to provide some stability for us as we adapt and rebuild for the other side of the pandemic.\" The planemaker said it was making \"steady progress\" towards the safe return to service of the 737 Max, including \"rigorous certification and validation flights\" conducted by the US, Canadian and EU regulators.  It said the jet had now completed around 1,400 test flights and more than 3,000 flight hours.",

            "text": "European planemaker Airbus has said it will stop making its A380 \"superjumbo\" if it does not get any more orders. Sales director John Leahy said Airbus would have to halt the programme if the plane's main customer, Dubai's Emirates airline, did not place another order. \"But I'm hopeful that we work out a deal with Emirates,\" Mr Leahy added. Sir Tim Clark. president of Emirates Airline, told the BBC: \"We remain optimistic that a deal can be concluded.\" Airbus said Emirates was probably the only airline to have the ability to take a minimum of six planes a year for a period of eight to 10 years. Airbus's comments came as it revealed that had received more orders for planes than Boeing last year, the fifth year in a row that it has beaten its US rival. The pan-European firm said it had booked 1,109 aircraft orders and a record 718 deliveries last year. US rival Boeing booked 912 orders and 763 deliveries.  Airbus chief operating officer Fabrice Bregier said overall deliveries could rise to 800 this year, thanks to the increased pace of production of its medium-haul A320neo aircraft. He said deliveries of the A320neo were slowed last year because of problems with the plane's engines, but these issues were now being resolved.  The A380 project was first conceived in the early 1990s as an eventual successor to the Boeing 747, with development work beginning in earnest in 1993. The plane has twin decks of seats, and is designed to incorporate amenities such as bars, lounges, beauty salons and duty-free shops, according to customer specification. There have been a total of 317 orders for the the world's largest passenger airliner since its launch in 2007. The Airbus A380 made its debut commercial flight in October that year with Singapore Airlines flying from Singapore to Sydney. Qantas took orders of the plane in 2008, flying the route between Melbourne and Los Angeles. Air France and Lufthansa have also flown the Airbus A380, but its largest customer over the years has been Emirates.",

            "text": "The Northern Ireland Secretary has said that the action taken by Boeing in a trade dispute with Bombardier is \"unjustified and unwarranted\". James Brokenshire was speaking at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester. Jobs in Belfast could be at risk after the US opted to impose a 220% import tariff on Bombardier's C-Series jet. Mr Brokenshire said he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the determination. He added: \"I say to Boeing this case is unjustified and unwarranted. This action is not what is expected of a long-term partner to the UK.\" He urged Boeing to \"get round the table and secure a negotiated outcome to this dispute quickly\". Bombardier employs about 4,000 people in Northern Ireland. About 1,000 are linked to the C-Series, the wings of which are made at a purpose-built factory in Belfast. Mr Brokenshire also used his keynote address to appeal to Stormont parties to find agreement and re-establish devolved government. Northern Ireland's main parties have been unable to make a deal since power-sharing collapsed in January. Earlier on Sunday, speaking to BBC's Sunday Politics Show, Mr Brokenshire said he would legislate for a Northern Ireland budget if an executive is not formed in October. At the party conference, he said that his message to parties is \"now is the time to reach agreement\". \"Now is the time to look beyond the issues that divide you. Show the resolve you have demonstrated in the past.\" He warned that if a deal was not agreed he would bring legislation to Westminster. \"If the parties remain unable to find a way through we risk heading down a different path, where the UK government will need to provide the necessary political stability and governance... starting with the setting of a budget for Northern Ireland later this month. \"This isn't what I want to see.\" James Brokenshire also made reference to his party's arrangement at Westminster with the DUP. After the general election last summer, the Conservative Party agreed a confidence and supply arrangement in the House of Commons in which the DUP support the Conservatives in key votes. The Secretary of State told the hall: \"We are and will remain two separate parties with our distinctive identities and values.   \"On some issues, we will disagree. But as two parties we are working together at Westminster in the national interest.\" DUP leader Arlene Foster and a number of DUP MPs are expected in Manchester in the days ahead and the party will host an event at conference on Tuesday .  Sinn F\u00e9in's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill will also attend a breakfast event with Arlene Foster.",

            "text": "British Airways' treatment of staff during the coronavirus crisis \"is a national disgrace\", MPs have claimed. A Transport Select Committee report accuses the airline of a \"calculated attempt to take advantage\" of the pandemic by cutting thousands of jobs and downgrading terms and conditions. BA said it was doing all it could to keep \"the maximum number of jobs\". But the MPs said the airline's actions fell \"well below the standards we would expect from any employer\". The aviation industry has been one of the hardest-hit since the pandemic forced a lockdown. Airlines including EasyJet, Ryanair, and Virgin Atlantic, and suppliers Rolls-Royce and Airbus, have announced thousands of job cuts. BA plans a major restructuring, which could mean up to 12,000 redundancies and changes to the terms and conditions of remaining staff.  The airline warned unions that if it could not reach an agreement over the proposals it would push through the issue by giving staff notice and offering them new contracts. That outraged the unions.  Unite and the GMB are not engaging in talks with BA. Pilots' union Balpa has had discussions with the airline over the possibility of voluntary redundancies but said consultations were \"hanging by a thread\". The MPs acknowledged that job losses in the sector \"may sadly be inevitable\" due to the collapse in air travel. But it urged UK-based employers not to \"proceed hastily\" by making large numbers of people redundant while the government's furlough scheme was in place. Unions told the committee that BA had threatened a \"fire and rehire\" approach by giving redundancy notices to most of its 42,000 workers with the intention of offering jobs to a proportion of them under diminished terms and conditions.  The Transport Committee found that BA had received nearly \u00a335m from the government as of 14 May by furloughing 22,000 staff. The MPs also noted that at the end of 2019, the airline recorded profits after tax of \u00a31.1bn and had cash reserves of \u00a32.6bn. The committee's report said: \"The behaviour of British Airways and its parent company towards its employees is a national disgrace. It falls well below the standards we would expect from any employer, especially in [the] light of the scale of taxpayer subsidy, at this time of national crisis.\" There have been calls from MPs and unions for BA to be stripped of some of its lucrative take-off and landing slots at Heathrow Airport as punishment for the treatment of its staff. Tory MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the committee, said: \"We will continue to bring pressure where we can, including the airport slot allocation process. This wanton destruction of a loyal workforce cannot appear to go without sanction by government, parliamentarians or paying passengers, who may choose differently in future. We view it as a national disgrace.\" Balpa said the committee was \"absolutely right\" about BA. Brian Strutton, the union's general secretary, said: \"Any company using the cover of Covid to slash jobs and terms and conditions like they have needs to be called out.  \"I have described consultation talks between Balpa and BA as hanging by a thread due to BA's decision to issue a 'fire and rehire' threat. That remains the case.\" The airline said in a statement: \"We find ourselves in the deepest crisis ever faced by the airline industry - a crisis not of our making but one which we must address. \"We will do everything in our power to ensure that British Airways can survive and sustain the maximum number of jobs consistent with the new reality of a changed airline industry in a severely weakened global economy.\" BA is already embroiled in a bitter fight with its unions and a row with the government. Now MPs have weighed in against the company as well.  It's a remarkable situation for BA. It was once seen as a flag carrier for British values, a national champion, with the closest of links to the government - and a place where staff were delighted to work. So what's gone wrong? The Covid-19 crisis has scythed through the airline industry, leaving previously strong companies teetering. Carriers around the world are shedding jobs, as they prepare for a bleak few years.  BA is far from unique in wanting to make deep cuts. But there's more to it than that. BA has spent the past decade trying to streamline its business, in order to compete with low-cost upstarts like Ryanair and EasyJet. That has sometimes caused conflict with its employees -  and seemingly created a legacy of mistrust and resentment, in particular among cabin crew. Now, during a crisis, those feelings are bubbling up. At times, the company looks as though it is under siege. The MPs' report also urged the government to abandon its 14-day quarantine rule at the end of June.  It called for a \"more targeted and nuanced border control policy\", allowing people travelling from countries where the infection rate of Covid-19 is relatively low to enter the UK on a less restrictive basis. On Friday, BA, EasyJet and Ryanair launched legal action against the \"flawed\" quarantine policy. The airlines are asking for a judicial review to be heard \"as soon as possible\", claiming the measures introduced this week will have a \"devastating effect on British tourism and the wider economy\". They said they have seen no evidence of when proposed \"air bridges\" between the UK and other countries will be implemented. Instead, they want the government to re-adopt the policy it introduced on 10 March, which required passengers from countries deemed at high risk of coronavirus infection to self-isolate on arrival in the UK. But Home Secretary Priti Patel has insisted that the policy can \"help stop a devastating second wave\" of the disease.

            "text": "Emirates Airline has unveiled a new first class suite on board its latest aircraft that features virtual windows. Instead of being able to see directly outside, passengers view images projected in from outside the aircraft using fibre-optic cameras. The airline says it paves the way for removing all windows from future planes, making them lighter and faster. Emirates president Sir Tim Clark said the images were \"so good, it's better than with the natural eye\". The virtual windows can be found in the first class cabin of Emirates' newest Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. Sir Tim told the BBC that the ultimate aim was to have planes with no windows at all. \"Imagine now a fuselage as you're boarding with no windows, but when you get inside, there are windows,\" he said. \"Now you have one fuselage which has no structural weaknesses because of windows. The aircraft are lighter, the aircraft could fly faster, they'll burn far less fuel and fly higher.\" Cabin crew need to be able to see outside the aircraft if there is an emergency, aviation safety expert Professor Graham Braithwaite of Cranfield University said. \"Being able to see outside the aircraft in an emergency is important, especially if an emergency evacuation has to take place,\" he said. \"Flight attendants would need to check outside the aircraft in an emergency, for example for fire, before opening a door and commencing an evacuation - and anything that needed power to do this may not be easy to get certified by an aviation safety regulator,\" he added. However, aviation regulator the European Aviation Safety Agency said: \"We do not see any specific challenge that could not be overcome to ensure a level of safety equivalent to the one of an aircraft fitted with cabin windows.\" Prof Braithwaite said the main obstacle in a windowless aircraft would be passenger perceptions of the technology. \"An aircraft could be very claustrophobic and for many, air travel is anxiety inducing already. \"The refresh rate of screen technology may also have some undesirable side effects - will they flicker? What is the lag? How will it affect someone on a long haul flight?\" he asked. Aviation expert John Strickland said having no windows would make aircraft more structurally sound. The move could also improve fuel efficiency if the fuselage were lighter than the windows it replaced. \"Everything that reduces weight on an aircraft is going to reduce fuel burn,\" he said. However, he personally liked to be able to see out of a plane: \"I'm a bit of a window obsessive. For me, artificial windows would be no substitute.\"",

            "title": "Mobile firms agree another 5G delay at US airports",
            "text": "US mobile networks AT&T and Verizon have agreed to postpone the rollout of their new 5G service at some airports. The C-band service, which offers faster speeds and broader coverage, was due to be turned on tomorrow.  But airlines in the US have pushed to delay the start, warning that the signals could interfere with aeroplane navigation systems. The telecoms firms expressed frustration as they bowed to pressure to limit their rollout. AT&T said it was \"temporarily\" deferring the rollout at a \"limited number of towers around certain airport runways\". Regulators had had \"two years\" to plan for the start of 5G service, it added. \"We are frustrated by the Federal Aviation Administration's inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services, and we urge it do so in a timely manner,\" AT&T said in a statement.  \"We are launching our advanced 5G services everywhere else as planned with the temporary exception of this limited number of towers.\" Verizon also said it had \"voluntarily decided to limit our 5G network around airports\". This third postponement came as the White House and aviation authorities rushed to work out a solution to an issue that airlines have warned could cause major disruption, forcing them to ground some of their fleets and cancel flights. In a statement, President Joe Biden thanked Verizon and AT&T for agreeing the delay, which he said would affect only about 10% of wireless tower locations. \"This agreement protects flight safety and allows aviation operations to continue without significant disruption and will bring more high-speed internet options to millions of Americans,\" he said, adding that officials would continue talks to find a \"permanent, workable solution around these key airports\". Phone companies have spent tens of billions of dollars to upgrade their networks to deploy the 5G technology, which brings much faster internet services and greater connectivity. But airlines fear C-band 5G signals will disrupt planes' navigation systems, particularly those used in bad weather. Two major plane makers, Airbus and Boeing, have also voiced concerns. In a recent letter to regulators, the 10 biggest US airlines said they wanted 5G signals to be excluded from \"the approximate two miles of airport runways at affected airports as defined by the FAA on 19 January 2022\".  \"This will allow 5G to be deployed while avoiding harmful impacts on the aviation industry, travelling public, supply chain, vaccine distribution, our workforce and broader economy. \"We further ask that the FAA immediately identify those base stations closest to key airport runways that need to be addressed to ensure safety and avoid disruption,\" they added. There have been several delays already because of the aviation concerns, with launch dates in December and earlier this month both being pushed back. Wireless industry groups say airlines are distorting the risks. Despite Tuesday's deal, some airlines including Air India and Japan's biggest airline, ANA Holdings said they had cancelled some US-bound flights because of possible 5G interference. The much-hyped expansion of 5G networks in the US has been chaotic, to say the least. The rollout has been delayed twice - and now AT&T and Verizon have bowed to intense pressure, agreeing to defer opening some parts of the network near airports. This happened because of concerns about the safety of aircraft. To mitigate those concerns, airlines would have had to operate under restrictions they clearly found intolerable. But those safety issues have been well publicised for more than a year. There was clearly time to come up with a mitigation plan - and other countries have been able to do just that. The question is, why were US regulators, telecoms operators, airlines and airports apparently unable to come up with a workable solution? In other countries, telecoms companies have been required to reduce 5G signals around airports by taking steps such as pointing antennae away from control towers.  But US firms were not expecting those types of limits to be imposed when they spent billions on 5G infrastructure, said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a professor of transportation economics at George Washington University and a former deputy assistant secretary at the US Department of Transportation. \"They want to get the most out of their investment,\" she said. \"What they should have been told beforehand is that they would not have free rein to use it because it could interfere with the planes but they were not given that information in advance.\" In an update on Sunday, the FAA, which oversees aviation safety across the US, said it had cleared \"an estimated 45% of the US commercial fleet to perform low-visibility landings at many of the airports where 5G C-band will be deployed\". The FAA added that it had approved \"two radio altimeter models that are installed in a wide variety of Boeing and Airbus planes\". \"Even with these new approvals, flights at some airports may still be affected,\" the regulator said. \"The FAA also continues to work with manufacturers to understand how radar altimeter data is used in other flight control systems. Passengers should check with their airlines if weather is forecast at a destination where 5G interference is possible.\"",

Cabin crew in Italy will go on strike for 24-hours on 25 July, while crew in Spain, Portugal and Belgium will strike for 48 hours on 25-26 July. Unions said further action may follow if the Irish airline does not make concessions on some employment terms.  On Wednesday the unions issued a list of changes they wanted to their terms and conditions. They include a request to be paid into bank accounts in their own countries, rather than in the Republic of Ireland.  Earlier this week, pilots directly employed by Ryanair and who are members of its Irish trade union said they would will go on strike for the first time on 12 July.  Last year, Ryanair pilots went on strike to protest about their working conditions.  After a long-standing hostile attitude to unions and a refusal to allow such organisations to represent staff, Ryanair finally agreed to union recognition in December. The pilots are striking as they say conditions that prompted last year's industrial action have not improved sufficiently. The four unions representing cabin crew said in a joint statement: \"We call on the European Commission, and the governments of every European country where Ryanair operates, to act upon the social dumping performed by the Irish low cost carrier and to enforce the EU employment and national imperative legislation.\" The statement was signed by Belgium's CNE/LBC, Spain's SITCPLA and USO, Portugal's SNPVAC and Italy's Ultrasporti unions. They do not represent all Ryanair cabin crew in those countries, but have said other staff are welcome to join the action. Ryanair has said employment conditions for its staff are competitive, if not better, than those offered by rivals.

About 1,000 jobs in Belfast are tied to CSeries aircraft wing production. Some jobs are seen to be at risk due to a tariff complaint brought by Boeing in the United States. Independent Unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon and the DUP's Ian Paisley raised the issue during an evidence session with government officials. Mr Paisley said if there was an executive, ministers \"would be on the first plane to Newark and down to Washington\".  The US Department of Commerce has made a preliminary finding against Bombardier, imposing 300% tariffs on future imports of CSeries aircraft into America. It is due to make another determination next month, following a complaint from Boeing about aid to Bombardier in the UK and Canada. Speaking during the hearing, Lady Hermon, in terms of lobbying efforts, asked officials: \"How did we miss out on Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill going out to Washington together?\" Mr Paisley interjected: \"The issue is there has not been a first or deputy first minister for the last nine months.\" He added: \"If there was a normally functioning executive... they would be lobbying very hard, carrying the flag and championing the case. \"That is noticeable by its absence.\"",

            "title": "Boeing says air travel to return to pre-pandemic levels by 2024",
            "text": "The plane maker Boeing says it expects that it will take another two and a half years for global aviation to return to pre-pandemic levels.  Its vice president of commercial marketing, Darren Hulst, said: \"The industry recovers to 2019 levels of traffic by the end of 2023, early 2024\" and domestic flying would be at the forefront of any recovery. Long-haul international routes would take the longest to recover, according to Boeing's forecast, partly because of government restrictions. Boeing says these will need to be eased to enable \"the recovery of the pent up demand that exists already in the marketplace\". Last year, passenger numbers fell 60% to 1.8 billion and the industry lost $126bn, according to the airline body IATA, which said it was the worst year on record. Boeing says that the strength of the global economy is key to recovering from the slump. Using data from IHS Economics it says that \"the global economy is actually trending back towards where it would have been had the virus not actually happened\". The International Monetary Fund is expecting the global economy to grow 6% this year and 4.9% next year, as it recovers from the damage inflicted by the pandemic.  But a coordinated global approach on travel restrictions is also a \" tremendously important\" factor in the recovery, Mr Hulst said, adding that common understanding of travel rules enabled people to \"resume business, resume visiting and resume how they use the global transportation system [like] before the virus began\". Across the world, governments have taken their own approaches to recognising vaccine and testing status. There are also differing requirements around quarantine periods which have made international travel a complicated affair.  However, last month the European Union introduced a vaccine passport to make it easier for people to travel across borders within the bloc. The aviation industry is crucial to the global economy. The UN's International Civil Aviation Organization estimates that before the pandemic it was worth 3.6% of the global economy and supported 65.5 million jobs worldwide. The US aircraft maker has increased its forecast of how many new planes the world will want over the next 20 years. It says 43,610 new commercial aircraft will be needed by 2040, which is slightly up on the 43,110 it predicted last year. They will have a combined value of $7.2 trillion.   A growing share of these will go to the Middle East and Asia, as China looks set to replace the United States as the world's biggest aviation market. The prediction is still lower than before the pandemic, when Boeing said the requirement would be 44,040 over 20 years. Boeing wouldn't be drawn on how continuing concerns around its 737 MAX and 787 models would affect its share of those orders. Mr Hulst said the company is continuing to work with regulators and other stakeholders to ensure their aircraft meet the required safety standards. \"We're working internally to make sure our quality is at the highest possible standards, and it's on us to make sure that we have the right products at the right time for the market\". The widespread fall in air travel has led to more than 4,000 aircraft being put into storage. This enforced rest could extend their lifespan which would slow down orders for new planes. However, with many airlines looking to move towards more efficient aircraft that reduce fuel usage and carbon dioxide emissions Boeing says that \"80% or more of the fleet that existed in 2019 will be replaced over the long term\". It also says the numbers in storage are coming down and will continue to do so as travel restrictions are eased.  \"I think we will also see some of those aircraft transition as they become feedstock for conversion into cargo aircraft\" says Mr Hulst, and that this is being driven by the e-commerce boom that has come with the pandemic.  Another big change for the 20 year period of the forecast could be how aircraft are fuelled, as the world tackles climate change. At the moment air travel accounts for about 2% of global greenhouse emissions. Research is being done on an alternatives including biofuels, hydrogen and batteries. However the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) found that at most, 5.5% of aviation fuel in the EU could come from sustainable sources by 2030. Mr Hulst says as an industry \"we've seen that progress over the last 30 years has been dramatic. Progress that we'll see in this decade will be dramatic, but we also need other factors, other fuels to be part of this solution. As we get into the medium and long term sustainable aviation fuels become a critical part of our sustainability goals.\"",

            "text": "US aviation regulators have ordered inspections of Boeing 737 NG aircraft after cracks were found on some planes. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Boeing discovered the cracks \"while conducting modifications on a heavily used aircraft\".  Similar cracks were found in a small number of additional planes, the agency said. The 737 Max, which was grounded worldwide in March following two crashes, is not affected by the checks. Boeing said 737 NG operators have been contacted, but they have not reported any problems. The US manufacturer has not said how many planes would be subject to inspections. \"Over the coming days, we will work closely with our customers to implement a recommended inspection plan for certain airplanes in the fleet,\" the company told the BBC in a statement.  \"This issue does not affect any 737 Max airplanes or the P-8 Poseidon.\" The BBC has asked Boeing for more details about the cracks, and where they are located, but there has been no response so far. Models of the 737 NG include 737-700, 737-800, and 737-900. Aeroflot, American Airlines, Ryanair and United Airlines are among the airlines listed as operators of the 737 NG model on Boeing's website.  In its statement, the FAA said it would \"instruct operators to conduct specific inspections, make any necessary repairs and to report their findings to the agency immediately\". Boeing grounded its entire global fleet of 737 Max aircraft in March this year following two fatal plane crashes. The 737 Max has not flown commercially since an Ethiopian Airlines aircraft crashed shortly after take-off on 10 March, killing 157. It followed a Lion Air crash on 28 October last year which killed 189. The FAA must decide if the plane is safe.",

            "text": "The US aviation regulator has indicated that the Boeing 737 Max might return to service later than airlines had hoped. US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) acting director general Dan Elwell said if it took a year for the grounding order to be lifted \"so be it\". International aviation regulators are meeting on Thursday to discuss the 737 Max's return to service. The plane was grounded in March after two crashes in five months in which 346 people died. Once the order is lifted, it will take between 100-150 hours of preparation before the grounded 737 Max planes will be ready for flying, say officials for American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said earlier this week that he expected the 737 Max to receive approval by late June or early July. Mr Elwell was asked by reporters whether it was realistic that the 737 MAX could be flying again by the summer. \"If you said October I wouldn't even say that, only because we haven't finished determining exactly what the training requirements will be. \"If it takes a year to find everything we need to give us the confidence to lift the [grounding] order so be it.\" He said discussions with Boeing over approving the safety update were \"a constant give and take until it is exactly right. It's taking as long as it takes to be right. I'm not tied to a timetable\". One decision the FAA has yet to make is whether or not to require pilots to undergo simulator training for the safety update. Aviation regulators from 33 countries, including the UK, Europe and China, are meeting in Texas.  The meeting, led by the FAA, could set out a timetable for when the aircraft can return to service. The regulator said it would provide its \"safety analysis that will form the basis for our return to service decision process\". The FAA also said it \"will provide safety experts to answer any questions participants have related to their respective decisions to return the fleet to service\".  Boeing has developed a software update for the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (Mcas) on the 737 Max - a new feature on the jet designed to improve the handling of the plane and to stop it pitching up at too high an angle.  Mcas has been linked to both the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March, which killed 157 passengers and crew, and the Lion Air disaster in Indonesia at the end of October, in which 189 people perished. However, Boeing has not formally submitted the software fix to the FAA. The FAA is expected to conduct a certification flight in the coming weeks. The executive chairman of the International Pilot Training Association, Captain Tilmann Gabriel, told the BBC: \"The FAA current acting director general has made it very clear that he is not committing to October, which was the real date [for the reintroduction], but there is so much to do.  \"The credibility of the FAA and Boeing is at stake here. I'm convinced that there is a fix found, but this has to be now properly introduced.  It is also not clear when regulators outside the US in other countries will allow the plane back in the air. China was the first country to ban the 737 Max from its skies following the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Other nations including the UK, Australia, New Zealand and the European Union soon followed suit.  The US was one of the last countries to ground the 737 Max in March following the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Southwest Airlines and American Airlines are the biggest operators of the 737 Max globally. The FAA has said that the issue of whether to make pilot training on 737 Max simulators a requirement before the plane can return to service is \"still under review\". The New York Times recently reported that the simulators - which Boeing provides the software for - were not able to accurately replicate conditions similar to those which played a part in both the Ethiopians Airline and Lion Air disasters.  Boeing said it \"has made corrections to the 737 Max simulator software and has provided additional information to device operators to ensure that the simulator experience is representative across different flight conditions\". It added that it was working with both the manufacturers of the simulators and regulators \"on these changes and improvements and to ensure that customer training is not disrupted\". Mr Gabriel told the BBC: \"The big thing is that the simulators had not anticipated the Mcas. Pilots didn't know about it and if the authorities decide that all pilots have to be trained in a simulator that [could] cause a very big delay.\"  Meanwhile, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) will also hold a meeting on Thursday with airlines that have grounded the 737 Max.  Alexandre de Juniac, the IATA's director general and chief executive, said the gathering was designed to assess what the airlines \"expect from the manufacturer and from the regulatory authorities\".

The US planemaker expects the US Federal Aviation Administration to approve design changes to the software \"no later than April 2019\". Boeing began work on the upgrade after another 737 Max jet crashed in October. Countries across the world have grounded Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 jets. An Ethiopian delegation has joined investigators in Paris tasked with uncovering the cause of the Boeing 737 Max crash on Sunday. France's Bureau of Inquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) received the flight data and cockpit voice recorders on Thursday. The software Boeing plans to implement includes updates to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System. This is the 737 Max's automatic anti-stalling system which is designed to keep the plane from stalling. It stops the aircraft from pointing upwards at too high an angle, where it could lose its lift. However, there have been incidents of pilots reporting that the system tipped the aircraft's nose downwards within minutes of take-off, forcing them to step in to stop the plane from dropping. The FAA has said that the Boeing 737 will not fly until a software update can be tested and installed. The BEA has taken charge of the Ethiopian Airlines aircraft's black boxes, but a spokesman said the first analyses could take between half a day and several days, depending on the boxes' condition.",

Five crew members and 13 civilians were among the dead, rescue services said. The aircraft was on a training flight when it crashed and set off a fire across several homes. One witness said the plane was ablaze before the crash. The King Air 350 turboprop reportedly took a steep turn near its destination airport before coming down. Rawalpindi, near the capital Islamabad, is the site of the Pakistani army's headquarters, and the plane belonged to the Pakistani Army's aviation unit. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan offered his condolences and wished a \"quick recovery for the injured\", according to a tweet sent by the Pakistani government. Witnesses at the scene said the aircraft crashed into a family home in a residential area around 02:00 local time (07:00 GMT). \"I was awake when the plane flew over my room and it was already on fire in the air,\" said resident Ghulam Khan. \"The sound was so scary, it was only a small plane. It then fell on a house where a family used to live.\" Another witness, Yasir Baloch, said: \"The tail of the plane was on fire and it took barely two to three seconds and it crashed four houses away from my house and burnt to ashes.\" A resident near the site of the crash who gave his name as Yamin said he had escaped his burning house with his wife, daughter and parents, but his brother, sister-in-law and nephew died. \"The window and door to their room was locked. We tried our best to get them out but couldn't,\" he said. Pictures from the scene showed blackened buildings that had been reduced to rubble. A reporter from the AFP news agency said smoke was still rising from the wreckage and pieces of the plane were visible on a nearby roof. Several injured were rushed to hospital, Pakistan's emergency rescue services said. The bodies of the dead were taken away to be identified. \"All the bodies are badly burned, so DNA tests are required for identification,\" said Farooq Butt, a spokesman for the rescue services. Pakistan has a chequered aviation safety record, including a number of airliner crashes. In 2010, an aircraft operated by private airline Airblue crashed near Islamabad, killing all 152 people on board - the deadliest air disaster in Pakistani history. In 2012, a Boeing 737-200 operated by Pakistan's Bhoja Air crashed in bad weather on its approach to land in Rawalpindi, killing all 121 passengers and six crew. And in 2016, a Pakistan International Airlines plane burst into flames while travelling from northern Pakistan to Islamabad, killing 47 people. ",

In total, 82 Iranians and 63 Canadians were on board the Kyiv-bound Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) Flight PS752, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said. There were also 11 victims - including nine crew members - from Ukraine, four Afghans, four Britons and three Germans. Iran's head of emergency operations said 147 of the victims were Iranian, which suggests many of the foreign nationals held dual nationality. A list of passengers was released by the airline, but the BBC is awaiting confirmation from people known to the victims.  The majority of the passengers on the flight were headed for Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed. Out of the 176 victims, 138 had listed Canada as their final destination. Of them, 57 of them carried a Canadian passport, but many others were foreign students, permanent residents or visitors.  Initially, the number of Canadian victims was given as 63. A number of the passengers on board the plane were reportedly students and university staff from Canada returning at the end of the holidays. The tragedy was a national one, touching many communities across the country.  British Columbia  Ardalan Ebnoddin Hamidi, Niloofar Razzaghi and their teenage son Kamyar, a family of three from Vancouver were returning from Iran where they had taken a short vacation and were confirmed to have been on the flight.

Her brother Mohammmad was the co-founder of STEM fellowship, a youth-run charity that helps students in maths and sciences. Other victims from the west coast province include Delaram Dadashnejad, an international student studying nutrition at a college in Vancouver, and couple Naser Pourshaban Oshibi and Firouzeh Madani. Alberta The University of Alberta confirmed that 10 members of the institution's community were killed in the tragedy.  Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand, a married couple who taught engineering at the University of Alberta, were killed in the crash, along with their two daughters, Daria, 14, and Dorina, 9. Arash Pourzarabi, 26,and Pouneh Gourji, 25, were graduate students in computer science at the university, and had gone to Iran for their wedding. Other students who died included Elnaz Nabiyi, Nasim Rahmanifar, and Amir Saeedinia, as well as alumnus Mohammad Mahdi Elyasi, who studied mechanical engineering and graduated in 2017. Obstetrician Shekoufeh Choupannejad, her daughter Saba Saadat, who was studying medicine at the university, and Sara, who had recently graduated, were also among those on the flight The \"community is reeling from this loss,\" said university president David Turpin on Thursday.  Also from the province of Alberta was Kasra Saati, an aircraft mechanic formerly with Viking Air, the CBC confirmed. Manitoba  Victims from Winnipeg included Forough Khadem, described \"as a promising scientist and a dear friend,\" by her colleague E Eftekharpour. Graduate student Amirhossein Ghassemi was studying biomedical engineering.  \"I can't use past tense. I think he's coming back. We play again. We talk again.

Amirhossein Bahabadi Ghorbani, 21, was studying science at the University of Manitoba and hoped to become a doctor, his roommate told the CBC. CBC also confirmed that a family of three from that city - Mohammad Mahdi Sadeghi, his wife, Bahareh Hajesfandiari, and their daughter, Anisa Sadeghi, were travelling together on the flight.  Farzaneh Naderi, a customer service manager at Walmart, and her 11-year-old son Noojan Sadr were also killed. Ontario Many of the victims were returning to their homes in Toronto and other nearby cities in the province of Ontario. They included Ghanimat Azhdari - a PhD student at the University of Guelph, Ontario. She specialised in promoting the rights of indigenous groups and her research group described her as \"cherished and loved\". Toronto resident Alina Tarbhai was also among the victims, her employer, the Ontario Secondary School Teacher's Federation (OSSTF), told the BBC. Her mother Afifa Tarbhai was also on board. The University of Windsor, Ontario, confirmed five people from their school had died on the plane. PhD student Hamid Kokab Setareh and his wife Samira Bashiri, who was also a researcher at the school, were among those killed. Omid Arsalani told CBC that his sister Evin Arsalani, 30, had travelled to Iran to attend a wedding with her husband, Hiva Molani, 38, and their one-year-old daughter Kurdia. All three were killed in the crash. The University of Toronto confirmed the loss of students Mojtaba Abbasnezhad, Mohammad Amin Beiruti, and Mohammad Amin Jebelli, and Mohammad Salehe.  Seyed Hossein Mortazavi, a childhood friend of Mohammad Salehe, said he was a bit reserved and shy but a brilliant computer programmer whose talent was widely recognised.  McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario confirmed the loss of PhD students Iman Aghabali and Mehdi Eshaghian, as well as of former postdoctoral researcher Siavash Maghsoudlou Estarabadi. The CBC confirmed that Mahdieh Ghassemi and her two children Arsan Niazi and Arnica Niazi, were on the flight. Tirgan, an Iranian cultural charity, said \"it is with a heavy heart that we bid farewell\" to some volunteers with their organisation, including couple Parinaz and Iman Ghaderpanah. The organisation said it was joining in mourning with another volunteer, Hamed Esmaeilion, who lost his wife Parisa Eghbalian, and their daughter Reera Esmaeilion. Western University said it was mourning four international students: Ghazal Nourian, Milad Nahavandi, Hadis Hayatdavoudi, Sajedeh Saraeian. The University of Waterloo shared the news \"with heavy hearts\" that their community had lost two PhD students  Marzieh (Mari) Foroutan and Mansour Esnaashary Esfahani. Quebec Engineer Siavash Ghafouri-Azar was returning home with his new wife, Sara Mamani, when the plane crashed. The couple had just bought their first home near the Canadian city of Montreal.  His uncle, Reza Ghafouri-Azar, told the BBC \"I cannot come up with words for my kind, dedicated nephew.\" \"He has been a very positive and passionate from childhood until his soul's departure from his body. Rest in peace my dearest side by your beloved wife,\" he said. Mr Ghafouri-Azar is a professor of engineering in Toronto, and he introduced his nephew to Ali Dolatabadi, an engineering professor at Concordia University who would become Siavash's thesis supervisor. \"It is a great loss,\" Mr Dolatabadi told the BBC. \"He was very intelligent, a gentleman. He had a kind and a gentle soul.\" He said his wife Sarah Mamani was \"very kind, very polite\". The couple were looking forward to throwing a housewarming party in the New Year.  Armin Morattab was worried when his twin Arvin Morattab, called him from the airport in Tehran, amid reports that Iran had fired missiles at US targets in Iraq.  \"He said he was coming back home soon,\" Mr Morattab told the Montreal Gazette. Arvin Morattab and his wife Aida Farzaneh were both killed.  The Gazette also confirmed that Mohammad Moeini, from Quebec, was also killed. Nova Scotia Global News confirmed that five of the victims have ties to Nova Scotia, a province on Canada's east coast. Dalhousie University student Masoumeh Ghavi, her sister, Mandieh Ghavi, were both killed, as was local dentist Dr. Sharieh Faghihi, and two graduate students at St Mary's University, Maryam Malek and Fatemeh Mahmoodi. Ali Nafarieh, a professor at Dalhousie and president of the Iranian Cultural Association of Nova Scotia, employed Masoumeh Ghavi part-time at his IT company. He says she was one of the university's \"top students\". \"I remember she has always a smile on her face. What she brought in our company in addition to skills and knowledge and experience was her energy. She changed the atmosphere over there. We'll miss her a lot,\" he told CTV News.  We have no information on the 82 Iranian nationals who died. Four British nationals were among the victims. Three have been named as Mohammed Reza Kadkhoda Zadeh, who owned a dry cleaners in West Sussex, BP engineer Sam Zokaei from Twickenham, and PhD student and engineer Saeed Tahmasebi, who lived in Dartford.  Last year, Mr Tahmasebi married his Iranian partner, Niloufar Ebrahim, who was also on the plane. Mr Tahmasebi's colleagues at Imperial College London described him as \"a brilliant engineer with a bright future\", and said that his contributions to engineering \"will benefit society for years to come\". His friend and business partner, Nima Shoja, told the BBC that Mr Tahmasebi and his wife were planning to have a baby. \"I talked with Saeed every other day,\" Mr Shoja said. \"I also tried to call him the day before his flight. [It] was late in Tehran and I was not successful.  \"He sent me a message in the morning [saying], 'I will call you tomorrow' - the tomorrow that he did not have.\" Ten Swedish nationals died in the crash. Many of them are believed to have also had Iranian citizenship. Swedish media report that several children were among the victims. Sweden's foreign ministry confirmed that Swedes were among those killed. It provided no further details. Nine of the 11 Ukrainian nationals killed were staff at Ukraine International Airlines (UIA).  Valeriia Ovcharuk, 28, and Mariia Mykytiuk, 24, were among the flight attendants who died. On their social media accounts, which are now being filled with tributes, they frequently shared photographs from their travels. Valeria posted just two weeks ago from a hotel in Bangkok with the caption: \"Work, I love you.\" Ihor Matkov, was flight PS752's chief attendant. The other three flight attendants were named by the airline as Kateryna Statnik, Yuliia Solohub and Denys Lykhno. Three pilots were on board at the time of the accident: Captain Volodymyr Gaponenko, First Officer Serhii Khomenko and instructor Oleksiy Naumkin. All three had between 7,600 and 12,000 hours experience flying a 737 aircraft, according to the airline. A former UIA pilot said he had flown together with each of the three pilots. Writing on Facebook, Yuri, who wanted to be known only by his first name, described them as \"great pilots\".",

            "text": "Boeing has agreed a deal that will give it control of Embraer's commercial jet business. The proposed joint venture will give the US aerospace giant a significant stake in the market for smaller passenger planes. Boeing has been courting Brazil's Embraer for some time. The need for a deal has recently become more pressing since its European rival, Airbus, took control of Bombardier's C-Series regional jet programme. Its deal with the Canadian company had threatened to give Airbus a significant advantage in the global marketplace.  The agreement, which values Embraer's commercial aircraft operations at $4.75bn, will restore parity between Boeing and Airbus. Under the proposed deal, Embraer's commercial business will be placed in a new joint venture, with Boeing holding an 80% stake worth $3.8bn (\u00a32.9bn). Embraer is a Brazilian industrial champion and a major manufacturer of military systems.  News of the deal sent its shares down more than 10% in Sao Paulo on Thursday. Some investors had hoped Embraer's share of the joint venture would be higher than 20%. Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing chief executive, said: \"By forging this strategic partnership, we will be ideally positioned to generate significant value for both companies' customers, employees and shareholders - and for Brazil and the US.\" Boeing said the deal is expected to close by the end of 2019 pending the necessary approvals. By Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent This deal, if it goes ahead, will restore the cosy duopoly between Boeing and Airbus. In the past, they had the market for large jets to themselves. In the segment beneath them sat Embraer and Bombardier, equally fierce rivals in the market for smaller \"regional\" jets. Both companies, however, showed signs of rising above their station. Bombardier developed the C-series, a highly efficient aircraft family capable of competing directly with smaller versions of the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320.  Embraer, meanwhile, developed the E-195 E2 - slightly smaller, but still capable of playing in the same ballpark. Boeing tried to kill off the C-series, protesting unsuccessfully about its funding at the US International Trade Commission.  But that simply sent Bombardier into the arms of Airbus, which bought a majority stake in the C-series programme, strengthening its position in the market. A Boeing-Embraer deal should restore parity - with both of the big players having extended their reach into the market for smaller planes. ",

            "text": "The head of Airbus' aircraft operations has mounted a strong defence of the troubled A380 super-jumbo jet, claiming its \"best years are ahead of us\". Tom Williams insisted the A380's absence from the Farnborough Airshow had nothing to do with falling sales.  It's the first time in more than a decade that the flagship aircraft has been absent from the global showcase. Mr Williams, who also warned about a possible trade war, told the BBC Airbus decided to display its latest products. An Emirates Airline order for A380s earlier this year has helped bolster the programme, but speculation about its future won't go away. The European aircraft manufacturer, whose wings are made in the UK, has become dependent on the Dubai-based airline to keep A380 production alive. Mr Williams, chief operating officer for Airbus Commercial Aircraft, rejected suggestions that selling the A380 was just too hard.  \"We are bringing the newest products [to Farnborough] to show them off, and there is a limit to how many aircraft we can bring. \"That doesn't mean, by any means, that we have given up on the A380. We are still fully committed. It's my personal belief that the A380 still has its best years ahead of us, which I think will come as we go into the next decade.\" The A380 debut was in 2005 at the Paris Airshow, and it showcased at Farnborough the following year. But one of the costliest aircraft projects ever undertaken has been battling for customers ever since the first plane was delivered to Singapore Airlines in 2007. Production has been cut several times as airlines shunned the plane due to high operating costs and competition from more efficient, but smaller, rival aircraft. Airbus is expected to make just eight A380s next year.  But Mr Williams believes a rise in global air travel over the next decade, coupled with increasingly congested airports, will help increase demand for the 550-seat A380. Mr Williams repeated Airbus' belief that Prime Minister Theresa May's Chequers statement on leaving the European Union showed the government was going in the right direction. Airbus had issued a stark warning about the consequences of a Brexit deal that could disrupt the movement of components and people around its pan-European operations. \"From an Airbus point of view I am very encouraged\" by the Chequers statement, Mr Williams told the BBC.  \"We also have to make sure we send the same message to the European Commission so that they understand the importance of finding a practical solution.\" He also warned about the consequences of a trade war between the US and China. Airbus has production facilities in both countries, and about a quarter of the aircraft it is currently building will go to Chinese customers.  \"A trade war is in no one's interests,\" Mr Williams said. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"",

            "title": "Boeing declares victory in Airbus subsidies dispute",
            "text": "US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has won a victory in a long-running dispute with European rival Airbus. The World Trade Organization has reversed on appeal a ruling that Boeing received some state aid to help build its newest aircraft, the 777X. \"The WTO has rejected yet another of the baseless claims the European Union has made,\" Boeing said in a statement.  However, Airbus said \u200e\"the 'game' is far from over\" as other complaints over alleged aid are still to be resolved. The two aviation giants have been locked for years in a sprawling set of disputes at the Geneva-based WTO.  Last year, the WTO backed a European Union complaint that Boeing got tax breaks to site a production facility in Washington state. The US, acting on behalf of Boeing, appealed the decision and secured an outright victory that is not subject to further appeal, the WTO ruling said.   According to Airbus, Washington state has given Boeing tax breaks worth about $9bn (\u00a37bn) and which were sufficient to shut out imports.  However, Boeing said the tax breaks amounted to no more than $1bn. The WTO's appeals body has now ruled that the tax breaks were not explicitly to prevent free trade, removing them from its most severe category of banned aid known as \"prohibited\" subsidies. However, the trade dispute is not over. Brussels and Washington have two larger cases pending at the WTO, centred on multiple claims and counter-claims about illegal subsidies for their respective aviation industries.  Boeing's general counsel, J. Michael Luttig, said in a statement: \"The latest of the false claims Airbus and its government sponsors have made has now been rejected by the WTO.  \"The EU and Airbus, meanwhile, continue to be in flagrant breach of WTO rulings and must eliminate the massive illegal subsidies the WTO said a full year ago had not been addressed, or risk US sanctions against European exports.\" Airbus, which estimates it has lost $100bn in sales because of Boeing subsidies, said: \"Boeing illegal subsidies are still illegal and need to be removed. The 'game' is far from over.\" Analysis: Simon Jack, business editor Game, set but not quite match to Boeing in this bitter 13-year battle. This particular dispute is now over, but there are two other cases pending to keep the lawyers busy. The world's biggest trade dispute has taught us a few things over the years, especially that making planes is very expensive.  All major planemakers receive subsidies from governments. How much they get and in what form has kept these two at loggerheads. Boeing has the upper hand in the argument over who's guilty of receiving most aid. But the biggest challenge to both these companies may yet come from the mother of all state subsidisers: China. If it's subsidies you don't like, then they must hate the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China. Comac has big plans to loosen the Airbus and Boeing stranglehold on commercial aircraft. Boeing sources tell me that the only reason they haven't taken a case against Comac to the WTO is that they cannot point to any commercial harm - yet. But Boeing and Airbus may be reluctant to drag China before the WTO.   It's estimated that China needs another 3,200 aircraft in the next 10 years. Their newest competitor is also their biggest prospective customer. ",

            "text": "If you want to get this briefing by email, sign up here Theresa May says she has secured \"legally binding\" changes to her Brexit deal after last-minute talks. Late on Monday night, she and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker sat side by side. Their main message? Britain has a second chance, but will not get a third. MPs must now decide whether to take that chance when they vote on the deal on Tuesday evening. What has been agreed? Well, two documents - this and this - both designed to allay fears about the potential permanency of the Irish backstop. A third document will also be put forward by the UK, which Mrs May says will make clear there is nothing to prevent it from leaving the backstop unilaterally if circumstances demand. Will the changes be enough? Well, Mrs May's deal was defeated last time by 230 votes, a huge deficit to turn around, but BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says the feeling from government is that it is \"back in the races\" at least. The PM is expected to chair a cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning to talk her changes over with ministers, and later we'll hear from the UK's attorney general. His lawyer's view on whether this does genuinely strengthen Britain's hand will be absolutely crucial to those MPs still undecided. Leading Brexiteer Steve Baker said the government appeared to have put a \"gloss on something that falls short\", but he looked forward to reading the full text. The Northern Irish DUP is also going over everything with a fine-tooth comb. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the PM had \"failed\" and urged MPs to reject the deal.  Need more help to make sense of all this? Well, the Brexitcast team stayed up to talk it all over. and here's everything you need to know about the big vote. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning Singapore has banned all Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft from its airspace following the Ethiopian Airlines crash which killed 157 people. It was the second fatal accident involving that model in less than five months. The US aviation regulator, though, says it believes the 737 Max 8 model is airworthy. Singapore is a major travel hub, and authorities insist they're working to minimise any impact on travellers. The cause of Sunday's crash is not yet known, but the plane's black box data recorders are being analysed. Read more about those who died. It's 30 years since inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee submitted a proposal for the world wide web. Now he believes global action is required to tackle its \"downward plunge to a dysfunctional future\". Speaking exclusively to the BBC, he said problems such as data breaches, hacking and misinformation could be addressed with a concerted effort. By Vanessa Buschschl\u00fcter, BBC News Edita Maldonado is 71 and lives in a small brick house outside of the Honduran town of El Progreso. Despite the town's name, there is little sign of improvement here. Most of its inhabitants live in \"colonias\", poor neighbourhoods, large parts of which are controlled by criminal gangs. Those who have jobs tend to work in nearby \"maquiladoras\", foreign-owned factories where wages do not even cover basic needs. Edita's daughter, Rosa, was working in one such maquiladora in 1995. She was 25 and trying to save enough money to build a small house for herself. But after she was robbed three times of her wages on her way home from work, she decided to leave. Read the full article Brexit across the board on Tuesday, but no consensus about whether Theresa May's changes to the deal are enough. Perhaps, says the Sun - with the headline \"Backstop from dead\" - she has \"breathed new life\" into her agreement. The Daily Express clearly hopes so: \"Now get behind this deal and let's unite Britain\", reads its front page. The Times says Mrs May has \"claimed victory\" but points out that the two groups the prime minister needs to win round - Tory Brexiteers and the party's DUP allies - both \"withheld immediate judgment\". The i is clear it's her \"last throw of the dice\". But an unnamed senior Eurosceptic tells the Daily Telegraph Mrs May's proposals rely on proving that the EU is acting in \"bad faith\" if the UK is to exit the backstop, adding: \"How on earth do you prove that?\" Museum murders Jihadist jailed for anti-Semitic attack Football abuse Club creates compensation fund Teenage boxer Safiyyah Syeed fights stereotypes Hawking coin It's got a (black) hole in it How chess is changing children's lives Are transgender women a 'threat' to female sport?

            "title": "Examining China's hypersonic transport plans",
            "text": "Chinese researchers have presented a new design concept for a hypersonic aircraft, which they say is a big step towards one day flying from Beijing to New York in just a few hours.  Which would no doubt be a speedier and perhaps more convenient option than the current 14 hours. Research into hypersonic flight itself is nothing new, but it usually focuses on military applications where there is more money for research and less pressure to break even.  So will flights five times the speed of sound ever make commercial sense, and carry passengers in two hours across the Pacific? When it comes to measuring aircraft going really fast the benchmark used is the speed of sound or Mach 1, around 1,235km/h (767mph).  Hypersonic is what the Chinese research is focusing on, with a team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences looking at one of the two big challenges; the aerodynamics, and the engine, which is much harder to solve. In terms of design, hypersonic flight requires something that can minimise drag, that is the resistance to motion from the air; the faster the aircraft, the more drag becomes an issue.  \"It goes approximately as velocity squared: if you double velocity, you quadruple the drag,\" explains professor Nicholas Hutchins of the University of Melbourne.  What's new about the design proposed and tested in China is a second layer of wings attached above the usual wings, in order to reduce drag; it's a little similar to a biplane.  At the moment the developers have only tested a scaled down model in a wind tunnel. So the project is still far from, quite literally, taking off.  Even if a design manages to cut down on drag, there are still other challenges that remain.  Heat resistance is one, for instance. But then there's also the not inconsiderable issue of the sonic boom.  If a plane breaks the speed of sound, it generates shockwaves. In simple terms that's a really loud bang. So loud it can shatter glass.     The engine is the more tricky bit when it comes to getting a future hypersonic aircraft airborne.  Once a vehicle has reached Mach 5, it can be propelled by a so-called scramjet engine: an air-breathing jet engine that sucks in air and uses that to burn its fuel.  But, and it's a big but, this type of engine only works from Mach 5 onwards, so it requires another jet engine to get the aircraft going this fast in the first place.  That could be an extremely powerful, traditional jet engine but eventually some combination of the two would be needed, say experts. \"There's been a major programme going on in China over the last couple of years to basically design that engine,\" explains professor Michael Smart, chair of hypersonic propulsion at the University of Queensland.  \"That's what would be the real breakthrough.\"  Aside from technical advances and possible landmark moments, the question is of course whether there's ever going to be a commercial market for hypersonic flights.  Steal a quick glance at Concorde and you might have your doubts. The supersonic Anglo-French jet was hailed as the future of air travel when it first flew in 1969, but few were ever built, and it was eventually axed in 2003 with no sign of a successor.  For one thing, the flights were too expensive for most travellers. And remember the sonic boom? Well that meant Concorde was only allowed to fly faster than sound once over the ocean. This restricted routes to trips across the Atlantic, and hence hurt its commercial viability.  So although recent years have seen renewed interest in supersonic airliners, it's all still at development stage. Challenges would be even bigger with hypersonic flights. They'd be even more expensive and also cause a sonic boom.  The research paper published in the February edition of Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy boldly assumes that in the future, hypersonic flights will be \"more convenient and efficient\" than getting on board a conventional plane. But it is \"at least 15 to 20 years\" before any such plans could be commercially viable, says Ellis Taylor of Flight Global.  \"It's hard to see a market for this at the moment,\" he says.  \"Historically in fact, air fares have been going down rather than up and it would be hard to get a wider clientele for a hypersonic flight. \"It would be a very, very niche thing - and that of course significantly upsets the economics of a commercial service.\" According to Chinese media reports, the scientists behind the research are also involved in Beijing's military projects around hypersonic speed, and it is defence that lies at the heart of hypersonic ambition. Think of aerial surveillance for instance that could be deployed very quickly, and would be hard to intercept.  Or perhaps hypersonic missiles that could render existing defence systems useless.  The big players on that stage are the US, China and to some extent also Russia.  Unsurprisingly, military research is a lot more secretive and it's hard to say who has the edge.  \"Historically, the US has always been in the lead, but China is catching up very quickly,\" says Prof Smart.  So the plans for a commercial hypersonic jet, even if they are at the early stages, are a bold marker leaving little doubt over China's ambition. ",

            "text": "Victims' families, survivors and many of those first at the scene of the Kegworth air tragedy have gathered in the village to remember the crash. It is exactly 30 years since a British Midlands flight from Heathrow to Belfast crashed as it tried to divert to East Midlands Airport. Children were left without parents. Men and women lost their wives and husbands. Many passengers also suffered life-changing injuries.  Unlike other tragedies around the same time the focus for the past three decades has been on those who survived. Little has been documented about those who passed away. Forty-seven people were killed, 29 of them were from Northern Ireland. The Reverend Lauretta Wilson told about 300 people who gathered for Tuesday's service in the Leicestershire village: \" \"Kegworth has never forgotten that fateful night on 8 January1989. \"Whatever our motivations, it is good to have the opportunity to remember and honour those who lost their lives. \"The dreadful event shook all of our communities.\" Hymns were sung, prayers were said and candles were lit. The names of all those who lost their lives were read out. This was followed by a minute's silence. Some of those who had flown from Northern Ireland to attend the commemorations wiped away tears as people paid their respects. Wreaths were laid by families, emergency services, councils and others at a memorial site in the Leicestershire village. Despite breaking almost every bone in her body, Dominica McGowan survived the crash.  She believes the reason for such a focus on survivors is because \"it's so unusual for people to survive a plane crash\".  Another survivor, Mervyn Finlay from Dungannon, had been at the London boat show with three friends. \"We arrived early at the airport and in those days you could just change your flight at no cost - so we changed to get on that flight,\" he explained.  \"We were sitting at the back of the wing and, about 10 minutes up, I saw the smoke coming from the wing and the smell of smoke on the cabin. \"The pilot said he was diverting to East Midlands Airport and you might have thought there would be panic but everyone was quiet.  He added: \"We could see the East Midlands Airport but he said to prepare for a crash landing and that's all I remember until I woke up in hospital seven weeks later.\" Mervyn broke his neck and back and several other bones. He has not been able to work since. Even though it changed his life forever, he is grateful that he survived when so many others did not. Dominica McGowan says it was only a few years ago that she realise the full scale of the tragedy: \"My son had recorded the news and various other programmes following the crash while I was in hospital. \"When I got home he told me he'd done it but I never watched,\" she recalled.  \"It wasn't until the BBC contacted me five years ago for the 25th anniversary that I looked online and realised how many people had died.\" She says she believes she would not have been able to cope with the scale of the tragedy back then. \"So many people died and I could have been one of them but I wasn't and it was just a case of luck,\" she said.",

            "title": "EasyJet slumps to first annual loss amid pandemic",
            "text": "EasyJet has reported its first annual loss in the airline's 25-year history as the coronavirus crisis continues to affect the travel industry deeply. The airline posted a loss of \u00a31.27bn for the year to 30 September as revenues more than halved. EasyJet added that it expected to fly at just 20% of normal capacity into next year. The pandemic has hit airlines hard, with lockdowns and restrictions cutting the number of people travelling. However, EasyJet welcomed the possibility of a Covid-19 vaccine being rolled out, and said underlying demand was strong for air travel. Chief executive Johan Lundgren told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said that the recent developments on Covid vaccines \"certainly is good news, because we know that is going to be a very critical part of the recovery\". \"But I don't think it's only about the vaccine, I think it's also about the fact that we need to have testing in place, we need to have also refined development of the quarantine system,\" he added. \"We know that people want to travel. On the news of the vaccine last Monday, bookings were up close to 50%, so it just gives evidence to the fact that any good news that comes out of here makes people more confident making bookings going forward.\" EasyJet's revenues plunged due to government travel restrictions in most of its markets, the airline said. These included full national lockdowns, which led the airline to ground its entire fleet for 11 weeks. There was some recovery in demand in the summer as lockdowns were eased, but widespread quarantine restrictions in September once again eroded demand, it said. The news on possible vaccines may be good, but EasyJet is still hunkering down for a long, hard winter, running a fifth of its normal schedule. The airline was one of the original standard bearers for low-budget aviation in Europe. Its business model has always been focused on cost control.  Even so, it has had to cut its outgoings aggressively in order to save cash. A tight belt has become even tighter - although deals with unions allowed it to tone down plans for sweeping redundancies. The simple fact is that if airlines can't fly, they can't make money, and even a relatively lean operation like EasyJet will burn through cash. But there is one positive. The airline believes that passengers still want to fly and demand will be there once travel restrictions have been removed. The pandemic has put great pressure on EasyJet's finances, forcing it to take on more debt, go to shareholders for extra cash, and sell dozens of its aircraft. Mr Lundgren said that in the near future EasyJet should not need more than the \u00a33bn it has already raised. \"No, we think we're in a good position at this moment in time,\" he told the Today programme. \"But we always also said that we're going to continue to review all the options that are out there to make sure we can cope with the circumstances, and you know, there's still a lot of uncertainty about when the recovery is going to take place.\" EasyJet has been making use of UK government support, borrowing \u00a3600m in April. The airline said on Tuesday that after talks with the Bank of England and the Treasury, it would extend its borrowing under the government Corporate Finance Facility scheme, and stagger repayments. EasyJet's results \"show the stark reality of a global pandemic on a once profitable airline,\" said Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor. \"With the vaccine offering light at the end of a very long tunnel EasyJet will have to navigate its way through a lengthy winter saddled with considerable debt.\" The airline's management \"has administered some tough medicine\" she said, including cutting its workforce and \"even flying its planes slower to reduce its fuel bill\". \"However, if EasyJet can keep its head above water it could really fly in the second half of 2021 as pent up consumer demand fuels a return to foreign holidays,\" Ms Palmer added.",

            "title": "Iran plane crash: 'More time needed for investigation' - Ukraine",
            "text": "It is too soon to draw any conclusions on what brought down a Ukrainian passenger plane in Iran on Wednesday, Ukraine's foreign minister has said. \"We have so many different versions of what could [have] happened to the plane that we need some time to really understand,\" Vadym Prystaiko said. His comments come a day after Western powers said they had strong evidence that the plane was hit by an Iranian missile - a claim rejected by Tehran. All 176 people on board were killed. The crash of Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 near Tehran airport came just hours after Iran carried out missile strikes on two airbases housing US forces in Iraq. US media have speculated that the Boeing 737-800 may have been mistaken for a warplane as Iran prepared for possible American retaliation. Footage has emerged purportedly showing a plane being hit by a projectile over the Iranian capital. Victims of the crash included 82 Iranians, 57 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians as well as nationals from Sweden, the UK, Afghanistan and Germany.  Earlier reports had given the number of Canadian victims as 63. Iran has promised a full investigation. However, TV images from the crash site on Thursday showed a mechanical digger helping to clear debris away, raising concerns that important evidence could have been removed. Meanwhile, the so-called \"black box\" recovered from the wreckage was due to be opened on Friday, Iran's official Irna news agency reported. Black boxes contain the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, and could provide vital clues about what caused the crash. At Friday's news briefing in Ukraine's capital Kyiv, Mr Prystaiko reiterated that at this stage Ukrainian investigators were not ruling out any possible cause of the crash. But he called for the \"level of speculation\" to be reduced, adding that Ukraine wanted to establish an \"international coalition\" to conduct a thorough investigation. Mr Prystaiko said nearly 50 Ukrainian investigators were already working in Iran, and there was \"full co-operation\" from Tehran. \"We are analysing pieces of the body of the plane, we are analysing the bodies of the people who died in the crash.  \"We are analysing the chemical residues on the body of the plane. We will come to our conclusion, we don't want to come to them right now. \"Our team has now got access to the black boxes,\" he said, stressing that Ukraine wanted them to be analysed in Kyiv. Iran earlier said it would download the information itself, adding that the process could take up to two months. Kyiv earlier said the US had passed on \"important data\" about the crash, without providing any further details. Ukraine's team in Iran includes experts who worked on the investigation into the 2014 downing by a missile of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine. Earlier on Friday, Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation (CAOI) chief Ali Abedzadeh repeated his view that a missile was not the cause of the crash. \"The thing that is clear to us and that we can say with certainty is that this plane was not hit by a missile,\" he told reporters. On Thursday, government spokesman Ali Rabiei accused the US and its allies of \"lying and engaging in psychological warfare\" in their speculation over the cause of the accident. An Iranian official told the BBC on Friday that there was documentation to prove that the plane had a mechanical issue before take-off. It was not signed off for flying, but Ukrainian airline officials had overruled these objections, the official said, without giving further details. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had received intelligence from multiple sources indicating the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, adding that it was possible that this was unintentional. \"This reinforces the need for a thorough investigation,\" he said. \"Canadians have questions and they deserve answers.\" But he said it was too early to apportion blame or draw any conclusions, and refused to go into detail about the evidence. The Ukrainian flight was headed to the Canadian city of Toronto via Kyiv. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson echoed Mr Trudeau's words and said Britain was working closely with Canada and other international partners affected by the crash. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said British nationals were advised not to travel to Iran, \"given the body of information that UIA Flight 752 was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, and the heightened tensions\". Newsweek quoted a Pentagon and senior US intelligence officials, as well as an Iraqi intelligence official, as saying they believed flight PS752 was hit by a Russian-made Tor missile. Video obtained by the New York Times appeared to show a missile streaking across the night sky over Tehran and then exploding on contact with a plane. About 10 seconds later, a loud explosion is heard on the ground.  Iran initially said it would not hand over the recovered \"black boxes\" to Boeing, the plane's manufacturer, or to the US. This followed the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone attack on 3 January and the subsequent strikes against US bases in Iraq on Wednesday. However, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) later confirmed it had been invited to take part in the investigation and would send a representative. Boeing said it would support the NTSB in the inquiry, and the Transportation Safety Board of Canada said it had also been invited to the accident site by Tehran. France's BEA air accident agency said on Friday it had also been invited to take part in the investigation.",

            "text": "Boeing has agreed to pay $2.5bn (\u00a31.8bn) to settle US criminal charges that it hid information from safety officials about the design of its 737 Max planes. The US Justice Department said the firm chose \"profit over candour\", impeding oversight of the planes, which were involved in two deadly crashes. About $500m will go to families of the 346 people killed in the tragedies. Boeing said the agreement acknowledged how the firm \"fell short\". Boeing chief executive David Calhoun said: \"I firmly believe that entering into this resolution is the right thing for us to do - a step that appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations.  \"This resolution is a serious reminder to all of us of how critical our obligation of transparency to regulators is, and the consequences that our company can face if any one of us falls short of those expectations.\" The Justice Department said Boeing officials had concealed information about changes to an automated flight control system, known as MCAS, which investigations have tied to the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019. The decision meant that pilot training manuals lacked information about the system, which overrode pilot commands based on faulty data, forcing the planes to nosedive shortly after take-off.  Boeing did not co-operate with investigators for six months, the DOJ said. \"The tragic crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 exposed fraudulent and deceptive conduct by employees of one of the world's leading commercial airplane manufacturers,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General David Burns.  \"Boeing's employees chose the path of profit over candour by concealing material information from the FAA concerning the operation of its 737 Max airplane and engaging in an effort to cover up their deception.\" Under the terms of the agreement, Boeing was charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the US, which will be dismissed after three years if the firm continues to comply with the deal. Of the total settlement, the majority - $1.77bn, some of which has already been paid - is due to go the firm's airline customers, who were affected by the grounding of the planes following the crashes. The firm also agreed to pay a penalty of $243.6m. But attorneys for the victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash said the deal on Thursday would not end their pending civil lawsuit against Boeing. \"The allegations in the deferred prosecution agreement are just the tip of the iceberg of Boeing's wrongdoing \u2014 a corporation that pays billions of dollars to avoid criminal liability while stonewalling and fighting the families in court,\" said a statement from the group of lawyers representing them. They added that the FAA \"should not have allowed the 737 Max to return to service until all of the airplane's deficiencies are addressed and it has undergone transparent and independent safety reviews.\" Boeing says it has now addressed concerns about the Max, while the plane returned to service in the US in December. The charge against Boeing was that its employees used \"misleading statements, half truths and omissions\" to dupe the regulator charged with maintaining the safety of US aviation. In the circumstances, you could say the company got off relatively lightly. It has avoided prosecution, and a large part of the settlement involves compensation to airlines - a fair amount of which it would probably have ended up paying anyway. The company would doubtless like to use this moment to draw a line under one of the most traumatic episodes in its history.  Yet while the 737 Max is back in the air, the scrutiny of Boeing and the FAA is unlikely to stop here.  Critics, including victims' families, lawyers and politicians, insist serious questions about the aircraft remain - and they're still pushing for answers.",

The Air India Express plane, en route from Dubai, skidded off the runway during bad weather before breaking in two while landing at Kozhikode airport. There were 190 people on board the flight and one official said it was a \"miracle\" the toll was not higher. It is still India's worst passenger air crash in a decade.  The flight was repatriating Indians stranded by the coronavirus crisis. First responders to the crash have been asked to go into quarantine. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was \"pained\" by the accident.  Flight IX 1134 was carrying 184 passengers, including 10 infants, and six crew when it attempted to land at the airport in Kozhikode, formerly known as Calicut. The Boeing 737 aircraft crashed at 19:40 local time (14:10 GMT) on Friday. Indian media said the pilots could not see the runway during a first attempt at landing due to heavy rain. When they did touch down, the plane is said to have landed 1,000 metres beyond the threshold of the runway before skidding off and sliding into a ditch. The impact broke the plane in two. Images from the scene showed the fuselage shredded, with the blue seats from the jet scattered along the ground.  Kozhikode has a table-top airport, a challenge for air crew during difficult landings as they typically have steep drops at one or both ends of the runway. Both the pilots were among the dead. Nearly 150 people are being treated in hospital. India's Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri visited the scene of the crash on Saturday, where he announced the recovery of the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, which could prove crucial to investigating the crash. He praised the lead pilot and said it was too early to say what the precise cause of the accident was. \"We have to be grateful that the casualties are only this much,\" he said. \"The aircraft fell 35 feet [10 metres] down and rescue people were able to reach there immediately, cut the body of the plane and retrieve people trapped inside.\" An unnamed official told AFP: \"Fuel had leaked out so it was a miracle that the plane did not catch fire, the toll could have been much higher,\" one senior emergency official at the scene said.\" By Imran Qureshi, BBC News Twenty-nine-year old Sharfudeen was so excited about returning home that he posted on social media that they would be back within hours.  He never made it, one of the victims of the crash at Kozhikode Airport. His baby daughter and his wife Amina were injured and are being treated in hospital. \"The doctors told us that she is fine. She has been shifted to the intensive care ward,'' Hani Hasan, her uncle, told the BBC. \"She was constantly asking for her husband. We did not tell her anything,'' he added. At least half of the passengers were those who had lost their jobs or whose visas had expired. The remaining where largely Indian nationals who had got stranded in Dubai because of the coronavirus lockdown. ",

            "title": "Boeing to end 747 production and warns of job cuts",
            "text": "Boeing has said it will stop making its classic 747 plane and is eyeing steeper job cuts than those it has previously announced. The firm is also planning to slow production of many of its jets, including the troubled 737 Max. The changes come as the firm disclosed a $2.4bn (\u00a31.8bn) loss as the virus depressed demand for air travel. \"The reality is the pandemic's impact on the aviation sector continues to be severe,\" said Boeing boss Dave Calhoun. Airlines around the world have responded to the coronavirus pandemic by reducing their fleets and delaying or cancelling aircraft orders.  This month British Airways became the latest to say it was retiring all of its 747 jets - about 10% of its fleet - citing the fall in passenger demand. Australian airline Qantas has also retired the jet, which marked its 50th anniversary last year. Boeing said the slowdown may mean deeper job cuts on top of roughly 16,000 layoffs - around 10% of its workforce - it has already planned.  \"Our government services, defence and space programs provide some critical stability for us in the near-term as we take tough but necessary steps to adapt for new market realities,\" Mr Calhoun said.  \"We are taking the right action to ensure we're well positioned for the future.\" The pandemic has exacerbated the crisis facing Boeing, which was already in trouble following two fatal crashes of its 737 Max plane which killed 346 people. The jet has been grounded since last March, costing the company some $20bn. The scandal led to the departure of top executives and a string of ongoing investigations. Boeing said it has re-started production of the 737, but it expects the rate of manufacturing to remain low for the foreseeable future as the virus weighs on the industry.  It said it hoped to be making 31 per month by the beginning of 2022 - instead of during 2021 as planned.  That would be roughly half the rate of the firm's production before the grounding. \"While there have been some encouraging signs, we estimate it will take around three years to return to 2019 passenger levels,\" Boeing said. Boeing said it lost $2.4bn in the three months to 30 June, as sales fell 25% to $11.8bn. Last year, it reported a $2.9bn loss in the same quarter, driven by a charge of more than $5bn related to the grounding of the 737 Max. The sales decline was driven by its commercial unit, which serves passenger airlines. Revenue dropped 65% as the firm delivered just 20 planes in the quarter, compared to 90 a year ago. Sales in the firm's defence, space and security unit were essentially flat at $6.5bn.",

It also criticised how the company's aircraft were certified as safe to fly by the regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation report was based on the testimony of seven whistleblowers from the industry. It came in response to two Boeing 737 Max crashes, which killed 346 people. Boeing said it was reviewing the report: \"Boeing teammates are encouraged to speak up whenever they have safety or quality concerns,\" the planemaker said. It also said that many issues in the report \"have been previously publicized, and Boeing has worked to address them with oversight\" by the FAA. On Monday, the FAA said it \"takes all whistleblower allegations seriously and does not tolerate retaliation against those who raise safety concerns.\" Whistleblowers raised serious concerns, but were ignored or sidelined, and lives were put at risk. It is a familiar refrain. But now, some of those whistleblowers have been listened to.  The Senate report is based on testimony from seven named individuals, all of them highly qualified. One still works at Boeing, while another remains at the FAA.  They include the likes of Ed Pierson, a former senior manager on the 737 Max programme; Martin Bickeboeller, who played a leading role in the development of the 787; and former FAA safety engineer Joe Jacobsen.  Their testimony paints a disturbing picture of lax production standards and deeply inadequate safety oversight, at a time when the industry has been facing new challenges because of the increasing complexity of aircraft.  Both the FAA and Boeing insist they have worked to address the weaknesses highlighted in the report. But two of the whistleblowers on the list recently told the BBC they still had concerns about the safety of the 737 Max.  The 97-page Aviation Safety Whistleblower Report highlighted allegations that the FAA's safety certification process \"suffers from undue pressure on line engineers and production staff\".   It also described conflicts of interest, where for example the same engineer had been responsible for preparing equipment for official tests, as well as carrying out those same tests.  It claimed that engineers with specific technical expertise were ignored or sidelined during the development of both Boeing's 737 Max and of the 787 Dreamliner. In one case, it says, an FAA engineer warned his superiors that the 787 faced a risk of \"catastrophic failure due to uncontrolled fire\" due to the way its batteries were installed. In 2013, the 787 was grounded due to battery fires. The report also includes claims by whistleblowers that there are gaps in the FAA's processes, that \"have resulted in aircraft designs that do not meet the most recent airworthiness standards\". It said this allowed the 737 Max to be approved to fly while equipped with software - later implicated in both crashes - that \"did not receive proper scrutiny\".  Flaws in the aircraft's systems were \"creatively hidden or outright withheld\" from the FAA during the certification process, the report said. The report went on to say that the FAA had failed to provide enough safety engineers to oversee the much-criticised \"Organization Designation Authorization\" programme, under which Boeing itself was responsible for carrying out a significant amount of safety certification work on its own products, on behalf of the regulator.  Critics have described this process as being like Boeing \"marking its own homework\". The committee report also draws on testimony that suggests the FAA has prioritised efficiencies, by delegating increasing amounts of work - and its safety oversight has been eroded as a result. The document pointed out that in recent years the regulator certified two aircraft - the 787 and the 737 Max - which were later grounded for safety reasons. In the case of the 737 Max this led to the loss of hundreds of lives and is estimated to have cost Boeing more than $20bn (\u00a315.2bn). In January, Boeing agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Justice Department, including $2.5bn in fines and compensation linked to the 737 Max crashes.",

            "text": "US lawmakers are taking steps to remove a tax break for Boeing that is at the centre of a fight between the European Union and the US. Legislators in the state of Washington, Boeing's main manufacturing hub, introduced the plan on Wednesday. They want to avoid a trans-Atlantic tariff war triggered by aircraft subsidies, the state's governor said. The US last year imposed tariffs on $7.5bn worth European-made products as punishment for EU support for Airbus. Those measures were approved by the World Trade Organization (WTO), which had ruled that the European support was illegal. The US recently ratcheted up the tariff rate on aircraft, in a bid to put pressure on the EU to act.  However, a similar case against the US, over the tax benefits for Boeing, is pending. In that case, the WTO is expected to rule in the EU's favour, clearing the way for retaliation against the US. \"There is broad agreement in Olympia that we need to act this session to address the WTO issue in order to avoid retaliatory tariffs that would damage not just our commercial aircraft industry, but other important Washington exports,\" Washington Governor Jay Inslee said in a statement. The state of Washington, on the west coast, is a major manufacturing base for Boeing. It granted the controversial tax benefit in an effort to keep the company in the state.  In 2018, the company saved more than $100m from the part of the tax break that would be removed, according to the Seattle Times newspaper.  Boeing said it supports the measure and called on the EU to remove its support for Airbus. \"This legislation demonstrates the commitment of Washington - and of the United States - to fair and rules-based trade, and to compliance with the WTO's rulings,\" Boeing said.",

            "text": "A plane crash in Cuba which killed 112 people was caused by \"human error\", the Mexican charter company which owns the plane says. Damojh Airlines said a study of the data recorders showed the Boeing 737 had taken off too steeply. Mexican pilots' union ASPA said Damojh's statement, which was released before the official investigation has concluded, was \"irresponsible\". The crash was one of the worst to happen in the Caribbean for decades. The Boeing 737 and its Mexican crew had been leased from Damojh by Cuban state airline Cubana when it came down 20km (12 miles) south of the Cuban capital, Havana. Eyewitnesses described seeing the jet burst into flames before crashing into a field close to a wooded area near Havana's main airport. Damojh said in a statement that \"the crew took off at a very steep angle creating a lack of lift which caused the aircraft to plunge\".  The company said it was basing its assessment on data from the plane's data recorders which had been extracted by a team made up of investigators from Cuba, Mexico and the US, and representatives from Boeing and engine manufacturers Pratt & Whitney.   However, the results of the investigation have yet to be released, Mexico's civil aviation authority said.  A spokesman for the Mexican pilots' union said Damojh was \"just looking to defend their interests\" by blaming the crew before the investigation had been concluded.  Following the accident on 18 May, two former pilots for the company came forward to allege that Damojh had a poor maintenance record.  Mexico's civil aviation authority suspended the company's operations in the wake of the accident. It said the suspension would remain in place pending the outcome of the investigation.  Most of the victims were Cuban, including 10 evangelical pastors and their spouses. Of the 113 people on board, 110 died on impact. Of the three initial survivors, two later died in hospital. Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel has set up a special commission to investigate the crash.",

The Airbus A350 plane was flying off the south of France when the fuel, made partly from waste products, was used. It was tested a number of times through both engines in 30-minute spells. Toby Wells, head of future fuels at Airbus, said data from the flights was \"very promising\" as the aviation industry looks into ways of reducing its climate impact. Rolls Royce, Airbus, German research centre DLR and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producer Neste were involved in the test flights that took off from Toulouse. Cooking oil and animal waste fat made up some of the recycled materials used in the SAF. A smaller jet flew behind the A350, coming as close as 100 metres at times to monitor emissions. Experts running the project said fewer particles were released into the atmosphere and they saw indications SAFs could be more efficient than traditional fuels such as kerosene. \"We were really happy to see, as predicted, the particular emissions of the aircraft were much lower when using the 100% SAF,\" said Mr Wells, who is based at the Airbus hub in Filton, Bristol. \"These particular emissions lead to the formation of contrails, which have a big contribution to aviation's climate impact. \"We still have a lot more data to analyse and further tests to perform, but the initial results are very promising.\" Researchers from The University of Manchester and the National Research Council of Canada are also involved in the study, and will be publishing further information about the test flights towards the end of 2022.

The country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said trips under the agreement could begin early next year.  However, the much-anticipated deal will depend on the Covid-19 situation in both counties remaining as it is now.  Travellers from New Zealand have been allowed to enter most Australian states without quarantine since October.  So far though, this has been a one-way agreement - meaning they must do 14 days of managed isolation on their return to New Zealand. And Australians are not allowed into New Zealand at all, unless they have an exemption. Ms Ardern did not give a date for the travel bubble to begin and the agreement will still need to be signed off by the Australian government.  Both countries have had very low case numbers over recent months but there have been regional outbreaks in Australia.  New Zealand was one of the first countries to declare itself virus free in June after a complete border closure and one strict lockdown period. It has since had a few cases. A planned travel bubble between Singapore and Hong Kong last month had to be postponed because of surging cases in the city. ",

            "text": "A survivor from last week's plane crash in the southern Indian state of Kerala has spoken to BBC Tamil about the dramatic moments leading up to the accident and what happened after. \"We heard the pilot through the speaker. He was saying \u2018Calicut land,\u2019 but his voice disconnected before he could finish the sentence. Two or three minutes later, we crashed.\u201d  This is how Yuojin Yusuf recalls the night of 7 August. He was among 190 passengers aboard an Air India Express plane that skidded off the table-top runway at the Kozhikode (formerly Calicut) airport in bad weather. The aircraft broke in two pieces, killing 18 people, including the two pilots. Mr Yusuf, who was seated at the back of the plane, sustained injuries, but survived. \u201cThank god I\u2019m safe and sound. I\u2019m in home quarantine with small injuries on my lips and my hands. But I\u2019m safe now,\u201d he said. The incident is India's worst passenger air crash in a decade. One official said it was a \u201cmiracle\u201d the toll was not higher. Mr Yusuf said that about 45 minutes before the plane was due to land, passengers started putting on their seat belts.  But 20 minutes later, the flight was still mid-air, going around in circles. \u201cI thought maybe the bad weather meant the pilot couldn\u2019t see the runway to land,\u201d he said.  Kerala has been in the grips of a severe monsoon, which has wreaked havoc in some parts of the state. On the day of the crash, floods in the state's Munnar district triggered a massive landslide killing some 40 people. Dozens more are still missing, feared dead. Everything happened very quickly as the plane descended, Mr Yusuf said. \u201cIt was moving very fast and it hit something and crashed,\u201d he recalled, adding that he heard the screams and cries of others in the plane.  He didn\u2019t know until later that the plane had essentially split in the middle due to the impact, breaking into two halves. Mr Yusuf\u2019s seat was located towards the back of the aircraft and he was spared any serious injury - those at the front were less fortunate.  \u201cIt took almost 20 minutes to exit the plane,\u201d he said, adding that he has been under quarantine in his house since leaving the airport.  \u201cMy heartfelt condolences for family members who lost their beloved ones.\u201d Flight IX 1134 was carrying 184 passengers, including 10 infants, and six crew when it attempted to land at the airport in Kozhikode.  The Boeing 737 aircraft crashed at 19:40 local time (14:10 GMT) on Friday. Indian media said the pilots could not see the runway during a first attempt at landing due to heavy rain. When they did touch down, the plane is said to have landed 1,000 metres beyond the threshold of the runway before skidding off and sliding into a ditch. The impact broke the plane in two. Images from the scene showed the fuselage shredded, with the blue seats from the jet scattered along the ground. Kozhikode has a table-top airport, a challenge for air crew during difficult landings as they typically have steep drops at one or both ends of the runway. Investigators have also found the so-called \"black boxes\" of the plane.  India's Aviation Minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, visited the scene of the crash on Saturday, where he announced the recovery of the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, which could prove crucial to investigating the crash. He praised the lead pilot and said it was too early to say what the precise cause of the accident was. \"We have to be grateful that the casualties are only this much,\" he added. \"The aircraft fell 35 feet [10 metres] down and rescue people were able to reach there immediately, cut the body of the plane and retrieve people trapped inside.\"",

The European manufacturer said it had stopped support and supply of spare parts for Russia's aviation industry. Earlier, Boeing suspended operations and ExxonMobil said it would end a multi-billion dollar joint venture with Russian state-owned company Rosneft. Firms are exiting Russia after the West imposed sanctions over Ukraine. Airbus said on Wednesday: \"In line with international sanctions now in place, Airbus has suspended support services to Russian airlines, as well as the supply of spare part to the country. \"Services provided by the Airbus Engineering Centre in Russia (ECAR) have also been suspended pending further review.\" US aviation giant Boeing said it had suspended \"major operations\" in Moscow and temporarily closed its office in Ukraine's capital Kyiv. \"We are also suspending parts, maintenance and technical support services for Russian airlines,\" a Boeing spokesperson told the BBC.  ExxonMobil is the latest oil producer to cut business ties with the country, after similar moves by BP, Shell and Equinor. \"We deplore Russia's military action that violates the territorial integrity of Ukraine and endangers its people,\" Texas-based ExxonMobil said in a statement. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of innocent lives and support the strong international response,\" it added. ExxonMobil currently operates and holds a stake in the Sakhalin Island oil and gas fields, alongside Rosneft and companies from Japan and India. It said it would now exit its Russian oil and gas operations, which have been valued at more than $4bn (\u00a33bn), and halt new investments in the country. Last year, ExxonMobil employed more than 1,000 people across the country, with offices in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Yuzhno-Sakhalinst, according to its website. Russia is one of the world's biggest energy producers. The announcement came as Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil prices - hit $113 a barrel, marking the highest level seen in more than seven years. On Monday, rival energy giant BP said it would offload its 19.75% stake in Rosneft after Russia's \"act of aggression in Ukraine\". On the same day, Shell announced that it would end all of its joint ventures with the Russian energy company Gazprom. This includes quitting the flagship Sakhalin II facility, which is partly owned and operated by Gazprom.  Norwegian oil producer Equinor also said it would start the process of divesting from its joint ventures in Russia. The announcements comes as brands around the world distance themselves from Russia as its invasion of Ukraine continues. On Tuesday, Apple also joined the list of major firms to halt product sales in Russia, in the widening corporate backlash over the conflict. American Express also said on Wednesday that it had halted its relationships with banks in Russia, in line with sanctions.  The payment card company described its business in Russia as \"small\", with one partner that issues cards and a handful focused on recruiting merchants. \"We will continue to comply with all relevant laws as the situation evolves,\" it said in a statement.",

The pilots of flight NZ92 from Tokyo spotted the drone as they were coming in to land at Auckland airport on Sunday.  The drone came so close that the crew initially feared it would get sucked into the engine, said Air NZ. The Boeing 777-200 plane and all its 278 passengers were unharmed. It was immediately not clear who was controlling the drone.  \"NZ92 was just metres away from a serious incident on Sunday,\" said Air NZ Chief Operations Integrity and Standards Officer Captain David Morgan in a statement.  \"The pilots spotted the drone at a point in the descent where it was not possible to take evasive action.\" Mr Morgan said it was clear that \"tougher deterrents\" were needed to prevent \"reckless drone-use around airports\", and called for prison terms for drone operators who endangered lives. Under current laws, individual drone operators who breach Civil Aviation Rules can be fined up to NZ$5000 (\u00a32560; $3,600). According to the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand, drones are required to be kept at least 4km (2.4 miles) away from any aerodrome. The incident is the second example of reckless drone use this month.  Flight operations at Auckland airport were halted for 30 minutes on 6 March after a pilot reported a drone within controlled airspace.",

            "text": "Boeing has reported its first annual loss in more than two decades as the 737 Max crisis continues to hit the firm. The planemaker was forced to ground the aircraft, which had been its best seller, in March last year after two deadly crashes that killed 346 people. Now it has said that it expects the bill for the grounding to surpass $18bn (\u00a313.8bn). That has hurt the firm's finances, pushing it to a $636m loss for 2019. Sales were worse than expected in the final three months of last year when the planemaker booked $17.9bn in revenues. That was much lower than $21.7bn that had been expected by analysts. \"We recognize we have a lot of work to do,\" said Boeing's newly-appointed boss David Calhoun.  He replaced Dennis Muilenburg who was fired late last year following his handling of the crisis at the company. \"We are focused on returning the 737 Max to service safely and restoring the long-standing trust that the Boeing brand represents with the flying public,\" said Mr Calhoun. = Samira Hussain, BBC business reporter, New York This was not necessarily the best first earnings report for the newly appointed chief executive of Boeing. There were some eye-catching headlines: more than $18bn in costs associated with the Max crisis; it's first loss in more than two decades; plummeting sales.  Boss Dan Calhoun's primary focus is to first get the planes back in the air quickly and safely, making fixes, giving pilots extra training and convincing regulators. But he also needs to re-establish broader confidence in Boeing planes - and that will be far more difficult. Yes, Boeing has been in communication with its airline customers about when the jets may be airworthy again.  But how do you convince the public that the aircraft responsible for 346 deaths, countless investigations and billions of dollars in fixes is safe to board? The cost of 737 Max crisis was thought to have reached around $9bn but Wednesday's announcement suggests the final bill could be more than double that. The return to service of the 737 Max has been repeatedly delayed. And last week, Boeing said it did not expect the fleet to return to the skies before the summer. Boeing has been working on fixes to try to get the 737 Max planes back up and running. And in an interview with CNBC, Mr Calhoun said he expected the firm would meet deadlines set by regulators. Meanwhile, he said that - despite the two fatal crashes - he did not plan to rebrand the 737 Max. The company had a total backlog in orders worth $464.4bn. Boeing's share price climbed on Wednesday, soaring by more than 4%.",

            "text": "Ecuador has agreed to allow US military planes to operate from an airport on the Galapagos Islands, reports say. US aircraft will be able to use San Cristobal airport, Ecuador's defence minister Oswaldo Jarrin has been quoted as saying. They will \"fight drug trafficking\" under a deal with Ecuador's government, Mr Jarrin said. The reported deal has prompted concerns over the potential impact on the environment and Ecuador's sovereignty. The aircraft involved include a Boeing 777 and a Lockheed P-3 Orion, Latin American TV network Telesur reports. The Galapagos Islands, 563 miles (906km) west of continental Ecuador, are a Unesco World Heritage site renowned worldwide for their unique array of plants and wildlife. Tourists across the globe travel there to see its biodiversity, which inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Legislators in Ecuador's parliament have called on Mr Jarrin and environment minister Marcelo Mata to explain the scope of co-operation with the US in the islands. They have asked them to elaborate on proposals to extend the runway at San Cristobal airport, daily El Universo reports. Lawmaker Marcela Cevallos said the plan would be alarming for conservationists, it reported. Opposition congressman Carlos Viteri said the agreement with the US was \"unacceptable\" and should be prohibited if \"it intends to cede an inch of Ecuadorian territory\".  Under Article 5 of Ecuador's constitution, the country is \"a territory of peace\" and the \"establishment of foreign military bases or foreign facilities for military purposes shall not be allowed\". Ecuador's former president Rafael Correa also reacted angrily, tweeting (in Spanish) that the island was \"not an aircraft carrier\" for the Americans. Mr Jarrin assured critics that \"there will be no permanence of anyone\" on the island. He said any modifications to the airfield would be paid for by the US, Telesur reported.  \"Galapagos is for Ecuador our aircraft carrier, it is our natural carrier, because it assures us permanence, replenishment, interception facilities and it is 1,000 kilometres from our coasts,\" he said. The BBC has contacted the US Department of Defense for comment.",

            "text": "Zipporah Kuria was fighting back tears.  Eight months after the Boeing 737 Max crash that killed Ms Kuria's father, Joseph Waithaka, the site of impact was covered on Thursday and unidentified remains of the victims were buried in rows of identical coffins. But Ms Kuria wasn't there. Officials from Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines are believed to have attended a ceremony at the site, but because of the short notice Ms Kuria and other relatives of the dead were unable to attend. Family members of three separate victims told the BBC they were only notified of the ceremony days ago. As a result, only relatives of two of the 157 victims attended.  \"It is absurd. It makes me shudder that Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines are at my father's funeral and I'm not,\" Ms Kuria said. The crash happened in a rural area to the south-east of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. It left behind a deep crater which until this week still contained accident debris and some human remains. Families of those killed say they were left horrified after they visited the site last month and found that recent rains had uncovered bones and other items. Some, they said, were floating in flood water in the crater.  Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 was lost minutes after take-off on what should have been a routine flight from Addis Ababa to the Kenyan capital Nairobi on 10 March. It came down in farmland, in a deeply rural area. In the immediate aftermath, those human remains that could be found were removed, along with the plane's flight recorders and large items of wreckage. The crash is believed to have occurred after a flight control system known as MCAS deployed at the wrong time, forcing the nose of the aircraft down when the pilots were trying to gain height. A similar malfunction has been blamed for the loss of a near-identical 737 Max in Indonesia a year ago. The aircraft has been grounded for the past nine months, banned from flying by aviation authorities around the world.  The violence of the impact of the Ethiopian Airlines flight meant that when my colleagues and I visited the site in May, there was still a great deal of smaller debris lying in the fields.  The deep impact crater itself remained, alongside huge mounds of earth from the recovery operation, with a rough wooden fence the only barrier to access. Animals were able to roam freely across the site. There were no guards and no official presence. After that, the victims' relatives say, the situation worsened as a result of seasonal rains. They have been demanding action.  Nadia Millieron, whose daughter Samya Rose Stumo died in the crash, recently told the BBC: \"There were bones being revealed all the time and local people are coming to the site and covering them. We want Ethiopian Airlines to move the piles of earth into the crater, take the unidentifiable remains into the crater and to cover everything\". Ethiopian Airlines, which is managing the site, told victims' families it was aware of the issue, but claimed insurance issues had prevented it from taking action. But after coming under pressure from the relatives, and following an investigation by the BBC, it appears those difficulties have now been overcome.  On Thursday, rows of coffins were placed neatly in the crater. These contained remains that had previously been removed for forensic analysis, but which could not be identified due to contamination. Then they were covered over and the crater itself was filled, the dark earth matching the surrounding fields. The site is now a permanent grave. Relatives of the victims believe Ethiopian Airlines had a duty to keep them informed about the burial and should have given them more notice. The BBC has approached the carrier for a comment.  Boeing has refused to comment on reports that one of its senior executives, Jennifer Lowe, was among those present. The company said in a statement: \"We continue to offer our deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Lion Air Flight 610 and we are committed to helping those affected by these tragedies.\" Last month, Ms Kuria travelled with her family to Ethiopia to collect and bring home some of her father's remains. She said it was \"heartbreaking\" that she was unable to get to the site in time for the covering of the site. \"My dad is being buried, well most of him, as we only received a small amount of him back,\" she said. She said she would have jumped on a flight if it had been possible.  \"They've robbed us of our closure,\" she said. ",

            "title": "737 Max: Boeing 'inappropriately coached' pilots in test after crashes",
            "text": "US Senate investigators say that Boeing officials \"inappropriately coached\" test pilots during efforts to recertify the company's 737 Max aircraft. The planes were grounded in March 2019 following two deadly crashes.  Investigators accused Boeing and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officials of \"attempting to cover up important information\". Boeing said it was reviewing the findings and took them \"seriously\", while the FAA defended its conduct.  The FAA said the Senate Commerce Committee's report contained \"a number of unsubstantiated allegations\", and that its review of the 737 Max had been thorough. It said it was confident that safety issues with the aircraft had been addressed. The crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia came within five months of each other and together killed 346 people. They have been attributed to flaws in automated flight software called MCAS, which prompted the planes to nosedive shortly after take-off. A simulator test was conducted as part of the FAA's efforts to ensure that the aircraft could be made safe to fly again. The test was designed to see how quickly pilots could react to the faulty software. In its report on Friday, the Senate committee said that based on \"corroborated whistleblower information and testimony during interviews of FAA staff\", it concluded that FAA and Boeing officials involved in the test had \"established a pre-determined outcome to reaffirm a long-held human factor assumption related to pilot reaction time\". \"Boeing officials inappropriately coached test pilots in the MCAS simulator testing contrary to testing protocol,\" it said. \"It appears, in this instance, FAA and Boeing were attempting to cover up important information that may have contributed to the 737 Max tragedies.\"  The report cited a whistleblower who claimed that Boeing officials prompted test pilots to use a particular control immediately before an exercise. It comes after the FAA last month cleared Boeing's 737 Max plane to fly again. It said existing aircraft would need to be modified before going back into service, with changes to their design, while pilots would need retraining. The FAA said the design changes it had required had \"eliminated what caused these particular accidents\". Earlier this month Brazil's Gol became the first airline to resume commercial flights with the Boeing 737 Max. American Airlines said it expected its first 737 Max flights in the US to resume on 29 December.",

            "text": "All Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 aircraft will remain grounded at least until May after the fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said. The aircraft will not fly until a software update can be tested and installed, the US regulator said. Sunday's crash, shortly after take-off from Addis Ababa, killed 157 people from 35 nations. It was the second crash involving a 737 Max in six months.  Some people have pointed to similarities between the incidents, with some experts citing satellite data and evidence from the crash scene as showing links between Sunday's disaster and October's crash in Indonesia of the Lion Air jet that killed 189 people. US Representative Rick Larsen said the software upgrade would take a few weeks to complete, and installing it on all the aircraft would take \"at least through April\". The FAA said on Wednesday that a software fix for the 737 Max that Boeing had been working on since the Lion Air crash would take months to complete. Meanwhile, investigators in France have taken charge of the crashed Ethiopian Airlines aircraft's black boxes as they attempt to uncover what caused the Boeing 737 Max disaster. The Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) received the flight data and cockpit voice recorders on Thursday. The first readings could take days, but a lot depends on the boxes' condition. Regulators across the world continue to ground the Boeing aircraft. On Thursday, Russia, Japan and Tunisia banned the jet from their airspace. Late on Wednesday, the FAA told the country's airlines to ground their fleets, but was criticised for not doing it sooner. Possible similarities between the accidents, focussing on the aircraft's anti-stall system, have shocked the aviation industry and raised questions over Boeing's, and the FAA's, insistence earlier this week the the Max 737 was safe to fly. In addition to Max aircraft in service, about another 5,000 are on order from airlines. Garuda Indonesia said there was a possibility it would cancel its 20-strong order for Max jets, depending on what the FAA does. A BEA spokesman said he did not know what condition the black boxes were in. \"First we will try to read the data,\" the spokesman said, adding that the first analyses could take between half a day and several days.  There have been reports, including by Reuters, that there was a tussle over which safety authority would take the lead in examining the black boxes. Reports said Germany was initially asked to conduct the analysis because Ethiopian Airlines had been unhappy at the way the Paris-based organisation had investigated a crash in Lebanon in 2010. Britain and the US both have highly-respected crash investigation agencies.  How long the analysis by the BEA will take depends on a number of things. First, the state of the recorders themselves. They are contained in very robust housings designed to withstand tremendous forces, and they are placed in the rear of the aircraft where they may be sheltered from the worst effects of an impact.  Nevertheless, they can still be damaged, particularly by intense fire. The investigators will need to extract the memory modules, basically circuit boards covered with memory chips, and carry out any necessary repairs.  The modules are designed so that information is spread across a series of chips. If one part is damaged, there should still be useable information elsewhere. Once downloaded, the data also has to be read. Surprisingly, it is not recorded in a standard form - so investigators will need to know how to make it useable. That will need input from the airline itself.  If all goes well, the investigators will have access to thousands of pieces of data about the aircraft - not only what was going on on the fatal flight itself, but also on previous journeys.  They will also be able to hear what was going on in the cockpit, what the pilots said to one another, and if any audible warnings were sounding. All of that should go a long way towards establishing the immediate causes of the accident - and finding out whether there really were common factors with the Lion Air crash.    ",

The wing tip of a Ryanair plane scraped a Jet2 aircraft as it moved to park early on 30 April. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said low visibility procedures were in place but controllers could not see that a space was already occupied. Neither plane was carrying passengers at the time and no crew were hurt. The AAIB said the Ryanair plane, a Boeing 737 with two crew on board, was taxiing towards the airport's main parking area, having arrived from Stansted Airport, when it struck the Jet2 aircraft, also a Boeing 737. \"Due to the poor weather and their elevated position in the control tower, air traffic controllers could not see the aircraft, taxiway or apron,\" the report said. The fog had made stand 22, where the Jet2 plane was parked, \"invisible\" to the controllers and the Ryanair plane was given an \"unachievable taxi clearance\". In addition, the report said the airport's Surface Movement Radar - meant to be \"the eyes\" of air traffic controllers when visibility is poor - was not designed to show stationary vehicles. The report concluded: \"The fallibility of the human eye in accurately judging relative distance at range seduced the crew into thinking that safe separation had been achieved.\" East Midlands Airport (EMA) closed stand 22 while it carried out a safety review following the crash. An EMA spokesman said: \"Immediately following [the collision] an internal team was assigned to review relevant procedures and changes have been made to our operating procedures that control the movement and parking of aircraft on the apron.  \"Going forward, the airport is looking at how new technology could further improve procedures. \" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

The airline group said it was confident that the Boeing planes would return to service in the coming months. Boeing is currently trying to develop a software fix for 737 Max planes after two deadly crashes. All 737 Max planes were grounded in March after an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed, killing 157 people. Five months earlier, 189 people were killed when a Boeing 737 Max operated by Lion Air crashed. By Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent This is not a firm order, and strictly speaking, IAG could change its mind if it wanted to - but it will still come as a huge boost for Boeing, at a show where it has been struggling to dispel the clouds hanging over its business.  The 737 Max may still be grounded - but it remains a flagship product for the American giant. It's worth remembering it is the fastest selling product in Boeing's history.  It still has more than four thousand of them on order, far more than the rest of its range put together.  What IAG seems to have offered is a vote of confidence that the company will be able to make the aircraft unquestionably safe, and be able to demonstrate to regulators that it has done so, allowing it to return to market before long.  The economic reality is that airlines need the 737 Max - because of its high efficiency and low operating costs. Airbus simply cannot supply the whole market with its rival A320neo. The deal, if it goes ahead, would be valued at $24bn (\u00a319bn) at list prices. But the \"substantial discount\" negotiated by IAG's savvy chief executive Willie Walsh is likely to be very substantial indeed. Meanwhile the announcement may help to alleviate the mood at Boeing's chalet, where it would be understandable if something of a siege mentality had developed over the past few days. The planes will be used by IAG's airlines including British Airways, Vueling and Level, the airline group said in a statement. The letter of intent was signed at the Paris Air Show. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh said: \"We have every confidence in Boeing and expect that the aircraft will make a successful return to service in the coming months having received approval from the regulators\". IAG's \"first priority is the safety of passengers and crew,\" a spokeswoman said. Boeing shares rose more than 2.8% after the announcement. The firm said it was \"truly honoured and humbled by the leadership at International Airlines Group for placing their trust and confidence in the 737 Max\". Criticisms of the crew of the Ethiopian Airline plane that crashed in March were \"seriously misinformed\", the airline's chief executive Tewolde GebreMariam said after a US congressman claimed pilot error was a factor in the disaster. This week a US Federal Aviation Administration official indicated that Boeing 737 Max aircraft might could be grounded until the end of the year - longer than many had been expecting.",

            "title": "Will Nigeria Air succeed where others have failed?",
            "text": "The Nigerian government is making its third attempt at a national carrier with operations expected to launch in December 2018.  Officially named Nigeria Air, the airline's logo and livery were unveiled at the Farnborough Air Show in London to mixed reactions at home.  The federal government will own just 5% of the airline in a public-private partnership proposal designed to allow for professional management and avoid previous mistakes. The Nigerian government estimates that initial capital for the airline will range between $150m (\u00a3115m) and $300m in the first few years of operation though the private sector partner has not been identified yet. \"This will be a national carrier that is private sector led and driven. It is a business, not a social service,\" Nigerian Minister of State for Aviation Hadi Sirika said.  \"Government will not be involved in running it or deciding who runs it. The investors will have full responsibility for this.\" The original Nigerian Airways collapsed 15 years ago and a 2004 joint venture with billionaire Richard Branson named Virgin Nigeria shut down shortly after he pulled out five years later because of mismanagement.  Nigeria Air will take off with 15 leased aircraft in December but there are plans to own 30 planes within three to four years flying to 81 domestic, regional and international destinations. While many on social media celebrated the return of the carrier whose logo is a stylised eagle with Nigerian flag colours, other saw it as \"propaganda\" ahead of the 2019 presidential election. Aviation analyst Aderoju Omololu is cautiously optimistic that the the airline can be successful if it grows gradually and strategically and engages industry experts in its management.  \"The airline should be allowed to operate as a fully private entity,\" she told the BBC in an email. Nigeria's main Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos currently handles eight million passengers annually while Abuja's Nnamdi Azikiwe serves five million, several times over their capacity. Some Nigerians say the government should focus on overhauling outdated aviation industry infrastructure instead of investing in a new airline.  The reboot of the Nigerian flag carrier follows similar actions by the governments of Uganda and Tanzania as well as several other countries.  Uganda Airlines just ordered four new Bombardier CRJ 900 aircraft as well as two Airbus A330neo planes in a two-day shopping spree at Farnborough.  The revived Ugandan national carrier is due to return to the skies in April 2019, exactly 18 years after its debt-ridden predecessor was liquidated. Neighbouring Air Tanzania is also flying again and expects to kick off its first cross-continental flight to Mumbai in September after it recently took delivery of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner.  Africa's largest airline by revenue and profit, Ethiopian Airlines, made $2.7bn in revenue in the 2016/2017 financial year and carried nine million passengers.  Though fully government owned, a professional management with complete control has allowed it to turn its Addis Ababa base into a Dubai-like hub for 70 routes.  The Ethiopian national carrier, which already owns a minority stake in Malawi Airlines, has announced plans to help re-launch Zambia's equivalent, a new airline in Mozambique as well as talks for smaller offshoots in Djibouti, Chad, and Equatorial Guinea.  Its CEO Tewolde Gebremariam met Mr Sirika, a former pilot-turned-senator-turned-minister, and other Nigerian officials at the Farnborough show to discuss plans for the new national carrier though a read-out of their conversation was not released.  Nigeria Air will look to follow the flight path of Ethiopian Airlines whose growth and profitability has exceeded its own projections while loss-making competitors Kenya Airways and South African Airways struggle to stay afloat. \"Mismanagement has killed Kenya Airways and South African Airways and most likely will in Nigeria Air,\" said Ken Opalo, an assistant professor at Georgetown University. \"Most of these are vanity projects that will likely prove to be financial sinkholes. States should focus instead on improving airports and lowering taxes on airlines,\" he told the BBC. African carriers are expected to make a collective net loss of $100m for the second straight year in 2018, according to analysis by the International Air Transport Association.  \"The continent's governments need a concerted effort to further liberalise to promote growth of intra-Africa connectivity,\" the industry body that represents 275 airlines said in its outlook last December.  Privately owned budget airline Fastjet was pulled from the brink of collapse in late June by a $10m rescue deal from its shareholders that will keep it airborne until the end of the year.  Internal wrangles and a failed expansion strategy have restricted its routes to just Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia and South Africa. Its woes are just the latest for an African airline industry held back by restrictive taxes, protectionism, expensive fuel costs and mismanagement.  Many airports across the continent feature old, abandoned planes from national carriers past that ground to a halt decades ago never to resurrect.  \"I do not believe any government would seek to own an airline for 'pride' reasons,\" says Omololu. \"Pride is the result of operating a successful airline, that is the goal, not the motive.\"",

            "title": "Saudi Arabia suspends Toronto flights in row with Canada",
            "text": "Saudi Arabia's state airline has suspended its direct flights to Toronto after Canada called for the release of detained activists for civil society and women's rights. The Middle Eastern country has also frozen all trade and expelled Canada's ambassador over the \"interference\". Canada has responded by saying it \"will continue to advocate for human rights\". Those held include the Saudi-American human rights campaigner Samar Badawi, sister of jailed blogger Raif Badawi. Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said she was \"deeply concerned\" by the diplomat's expulsion, but added: \"Canada will always stand up for the protection of human rights, including women's rights and freedom of expression around the world.  \"We will never hesitate to promote these values and we believe that this dialogue is critical to international diplomacy.\" Her Saudi counterpart, Adel al-Jubeir, had earlier tweeted that Canada's position was based on \"misleading information\", adding that anyone arrested was \"subject to Saudi laws that guarantee their rights\". The leading Saudi women's rights campaigner Manal al-Sharif thanked Canada for \"speaking up\" and asked when other Western powers would do the same. In what appeared to be a further sign of deteriorating relations between the two countries, a verified Twitter account, which is reportedly linked to Saudi authorities, shared an image of a plane flying towards Toronto's famed CN Tower. The image was overlaid with text, including a quote which read \"he who with what doesn't concern him finds what doesn't please him\". People on social media have been quick to point out the similarities between the image and images of 9/11. The account has since been deleted, but cached versions of the tweet are circulating online.  Last Tuesday, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said at least 15 human rights defenders and women's rights activists critical of the Saudi government had been arrested or detained arbitrarily since 15 May.  Eight of them are believed to have been released pending \"procedural reviews\", but the whereabouts of several others are unknown.  Several of those detained have been accused of serious crimes, including \"suspicious contact with foreign parties\", and could face up to 20 years in prison.  Human rights groups reported that Ms Badawi was also detained last week, along with fellow women's rights campaigner Nassima al-Sadah.  Ms Badawi was given the US International Women of Courage Award in 2012 and is known for challenging Saudi Arabia's male guardianship system.  Her brother Raif was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes for \"insulting Islam\" online back in 2014, while his wife, Ensaf Haidar, lives in Canada and recently became a Canadian citizen.  Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland wrote on Twitter on Thursday that she was \"very alarmed\" to learn that Ms Badawi had been detained.  The next day, the Canadian foreign ministry called for the activist's \"immediate release\". The Saudi foreign ministry statement  expressed \"disbelief [at] this negative unfounded comment which was not based [on] any accurate or true information\".  It insisted the activists were being detained lawfully and that the Canadian statements represented \"blatant interference in the kingdom's domestic affairs\". The ministry recalled its ambassador to Canada for consultations and declared the Canadian ambassador persona non grata, giving him 24 hours to leave. Saudi Arabia would also \"put on hold all new business and investment transactions with Canada while retaining its right to take further action\", it said. Trade between the two countries was worth $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) in 2016. All scholarships enabling Saudi students to study in Canada were also suspended, while students already in the country will be relocated.  It is unclear how many people this will affect. The Vancouver Sun said in 2015 that about 5,000 new students arrive from Saudi Arabia each year.",

            "text": "A US passenger plane travelling from Seattle to Dallas was forced to turn back hours into its flight because a human heart had been left on board. Southwest Airlines says the organ was flown to Seattle from California, where it was to be processed at a hospital to have a valve recovered for future use. But it was never unloaded and its absence was not noticed until the plane was almost half-way to Dallas.  The heart itself had not been intended for a specific patient. Details of the incident, which occurred on Sunday, were revealed in media reports on Thursday. Passengers were said to have been shocked when the captain told them about the cargo and why the flight was turning back. Some used their smartphones to investigate the length of time that a heart can be stored before it is no longer viable for a transplant operation - typically between four and six hours, according to experts.  The plane was reportedly in the air for about three hours. A doctor who was among the passengers but not involved in the shipment of the organ, told the Seattle Times newspaper that the incident was a \"horrific story of gross negligence\". Following the flight's return to Seattle, the heart was taken to a donor health centre for tissue storage and was said to have been received within the required time frame, the newspaper added. In a statement, Southwest Airlines said the heart reached its intended destination \"within the window of time allotted by our cargo customer\". A spokeswoman for Sierra Donor Services, the nonprofit that organised the donation, said that the heart will now be processed so that its valves can be used for life-saving procedures, but added that these \"won't be available for implant for quite some time\". Monica Johnson, Sierra Donor Services' executive director, said the donor's family had been notified of the travel delay. \"They are relieved their loved one's heart valves were received and will be able to help others,\" she said. After the plane returned to Seattle it was taken out of service due to a mechanical issue that Southwest says was unrelated to the heart mishap.",

            "text": "The head of US aerospace and defence giant Boeing has warned about potential damage of the growing US-China trade row. \"Aerospace thrives on free and open trade,\" said chief executive Dennis Muilenburg. He said he was concerned tariffs could push up costs for aircraft manufacturers. \"The aerospace sector drives economic benefits globally,\" he added.  With both the US and China imposing tariffs on each other's goods, Mr Muilenburg said Boeing wanted to find \"alternative solutions\" to trade disputes. \"We are concerned it could affect supply chain costs - but those supply chains are flowing in both directions [between China and the US], it is an intricate network around the world.\" Speaking to reporters ahead of this week's Farnborough Airshow, Mr Muilenburg insisted that the White House was listening to his firm's arguments. \"We engaged very much with both governments [in China and the US,\" he said, \"our voice is being heard.\" He was hopeful that there would be a \"good resolution\" to the disputes, adding \"our job is to maintain a long-term perspective\". This month, the US imposed tariffs of $34bn (\u00a325.7bn) on Chinese goods. In response, China introduced equivalent tariffs on US imports, such as pork and soya beans. President Trump has now gone further and threatened to impose tariffs on a further $200bn of Chinese trade. China has said it will retaliate. The US has also imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports - a 25% tax on steel and 10% tax on aluminium from the EU, Mexico and Canada.  All of this has raised concern that these multiple trade disputes will slow global growth. Mr Muilenburg said that Boeing has not yet felt the impact of any tariffs on its business, but added that \"the rhetoric about potential penalty actions are a concern for us\".  On China, Mr Muilenburg said that Beijing \"well understood\" the need to expand their aerospace capability to drive their growth. \"We understand their long-term aim to be a global competitor. The idea of co-operation, collaboration and competition in China - this is the business model - it's not new.\" Follow Tim Bowler on Twitter @timbowlerbbc",

            "title": "Rafale deal: Why French jets are at the centre of an Indian political storm",
            "text": "India's opposition parties are demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi over allegations of corruption in a multi-billion dollar fighter jet deal. Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the main opposition Congress party, has alleged that Mr Modi \"favoured\" an Indian company that is part of the French deal. Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has denied the allegation, saying the government signed the deal to meet the Indian Air Force's combat requirements and had no role in choosing the French manufacturer's local partner. The issue has caused a political storm in India, and much of the debate in TV news shows has revolved around it in the past few days. India, the world's second-largest defence importer in 2017, signed a government-to-government deal with France in 2016 to buy 36 Rafale warplanes manufactured by Dassault Aviation. With this deal, Delhi is hoping to modernise its Soviet-era air force fleet. The Rafale is a multi-role aircraft - capable of carrying out long-range missions, including conducting highly-accurate sea and ground attacks.  The first Rafales are expected to be delivered by 2019 and India is set to have all 36 jets within six years. Mr Modi announced the deal in Paris along with then French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. The Indian government said it had negotiated the \"best deal\" to strengthen its air combat capabilities. Almost two years later, the leaders seem to have different views on what they once described as an important deal. Mr Hollande sparked political controversy in India last week by telling French news website Mediapart that Mr Modi's government had pressured Dassault to partner with India's Reliance Defence to meet its \"offset policy\". The \"offset\" clause in Delhi's defence procurement rules says that foreign firms need to invest at least 30% of a deal's worth back in India. It was introduced in India's Defence Procurement Procedure in 2008 to boost domestic manufacturing. As part of the 2016 Rafale deal, Dassault agreed to invest 50% of the estimated $8.7bn (\u00a36.6bn) contract in India to manufacture some components of the jet with billionaire Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence. Mr Hollande told Mediapart that his government didn't have a say in the matter. \"It was the Indian government who proposed this [Reliance] service group, and Dassault who negotiated with Ambani. We did not have a choice, we took the interlocutor who was given to us,\" he said. The Congress party has accused Mr Modi of practising crony capitalism by helping Anil Ambani's firm. \"The PM personally negotiated and changed the Rafale deal behind closed doors... The PM has betrayed India. He has dishonoured the blood of our soldiers,\" Mr Gandhi tweeted. He has demanded that the government order an inquiry into the deal. But ministers have rejected the allegation, saying Dassault was free to pick any competent Indian manufacturer.  The French firm has also supported the Indian government's claim. \"This [the selection of Reliance] is Dassault Aviation's choice. This partnership has led to the creation of the Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd (DRAL) joint-venture in February 2017,\" it said. Mr Ambani has always denied any wrongdoing in the deal. He has previously said that the joint venture was agreed directly between his firm and Dassault, and that the government was not involved.  The French government seems to have taken a cautious approach. Its statement does not directly contradict Mr Hollande, but emphasises that it did not have a role in Dassault's decisions. \"The French government is in no manner involved in the choice of Indian industrial partners who have been, are being, or will be selected by French companies,\" it said. The Congress party has also accused Mr Modi of compromising national security and destroying state-run defence manufacturing firms. It's a reality that India is facing a severe shortage of fighter jets. It would need 42 squadrons in the scenario of a two-front war with China and Pakistan. But its squadron strength has depleted to 31 - largely owing to ageing Russian aircraft. But this realisation is not new. The BJP government in 2000 decided to buy new fighter jets. Its successor Congress continued the process and issued tenders in 2008 to buy 126 jets. Dassault was finalised as a supplier in 2012, and the state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) was selected as partner to produce 108 jets in India. But the two partners couldn't agree on terms and conditions, and the deal stalled. When Mr Modi swept to power in 2014, he made the procurement of the jets one of his priorities. But instead of taking the deal forward, he surprised many by ordering 36 jets as part of a new deal in which HAL was not included. The Indian government says it decided to buy the 36 jets in \"fly-away\" condition to quickly address the problem of the air force's depleting strength.  But it's not clear where India will procure the remaining aircraft it needs in the long term.  In April, the air force announced it would be seeking bids for around 110 more fighter jets. The Congress party has also accused Mr Modi of paying more than what its government had negotiated in 2012 on a per aircraft basis. But there are no details available about how much the government has agreed to pay Dassault.  Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman earlier said that she would disclose cost details to prove Congress wrong. But she later said the government would not do so because the information was classified. The absence of such details has given more political ammunition to the Congress party ahead of next year's general elections. While senior ministers have come out to defend the BJP leader, Mr Modi's silence on the matter has helped the opposition's case. The BJP said the government needed to fight a \"perception battle\" with opposition parties. But until Mr Modi speaks, it's going to be a tough task because people want answers from the man they elected to lead India.  ",

            "text": "Virgin Australia has been bought by US private equity group Bain Capital after falling into administration due to coronavirus travel restrictions. The airline was struggling with long-term debt of A$5bn (\u00a32.55bn; $3.17bn) even before the pandemic struck. Australia's second biggest carrier had unsuccessfully asked for government loans before its collapse in April. Virgin Australia is currently owned by a number of major shareholders including Sir Richard Branson. Administrators for the airline, Deloitte, said on Friday that Bain would become the new owners, with the deal expected to be completed by the end of August. A statement said Bain supports the airline's current management team and its turnaround plan for the business. It has also committed to retain thousands of jobs. In addition, a \"significant injection of capital\" would be made to help Virgin Australia recapitalise for the future, according to the statement. Bain and another US firm, Cyrus Capital Partners, had been in the running to buy the airline before Cyrus pulled out on Friday. \"Bain Capital has presented a strong and compelling bid for the business that will secure the future of Australia\u2019s second airline, thousands of employees and their families and ensure Australia continues to enjoy the benefits of a competitive aviation sector,\" Deloitte said in the statement. Simon Atkinson, BBC News, Sydney While there was plenty of interest in buying Virgin Australia, there'll still be sighs of relief in the corridors of power that the airline has a new owner. For the government this is a win. Virgin was saved without state intervention and the prospect of a Qantas monopoly has been avoided. In the short term - if and when state borders open up - there'll be pent up demand at both airlines (and their cut-price subsidiaries) from people desperate to fly around Australia to see family, do deals or have a holiday at home instead of abroad. But Australia is in its first recession in almost three decades. Record unemployment and the inevitable tapering of Covid-19 welfare payments mean there'll soon be limited dollars floating around for people to spend.  And the success of video conferencing will be making cash-strapped firms reconsider those Sydney-Melbourne business trips that have been the proverbial cash cow for both Qantas and Virgin. So it'll be interesting to see how the two airlines compete and, given they're both flush with new investment, whether they go down the path of a price war. Other than Sir Richard, Virgin Australia is currently owned by a number of shareholders including Singapore Airlines, the UAE government and China's HNA airline. Sir Richard has said he will sell a stake in his Virgin Galactic space tourism business to support his other businesses, including Virgin Atlantic. He also put up his luxury Necker Island as collateral to help secure a government loan. On Thursday rival airline Qantas said it will axe 6,000 jobs as part of its plans to survive the coronavirus pandemic.",

            "text": "German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has cancelled a trip to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji after her government plane was forced to make a second emergency landing in two days. She was left stranded in Abu Dhabi after the 23-year-old Airbus A340-300 had repeated wing flap problems. \"This is beyond annoying,\" the minister wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. Germany may enjoy a reputation for efficiency, but its government planes are notoriously unreliable.  In 2018 the same Airbus plane had a technical fault which forced the then Chancellor Angela Merkel to miss the opening of a G20 summit in Argentina. Earlier that year, Olaf Scholz - Germany's finance minister at the time and now chancellor - was stranded in Indonesia after rodents chewed through cables on that plane. Ms Baerbock was en route to the Indo-Pacific on Sunday when the wing flaps on her plane malfunctioned, forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing in the United Arab Emirates. After repairs and a successful test flight, the aircraft took off again on Tuesday - only for the same problem to arise. In the end, the minister was forced to cancel her planned week-long trip. Her team could not be booked onto commercial flights within the time schedule. \"We have tried everything: unfortunately it is logistically impossible to continue my Indo-Pacific journey without the defective plane,\" Ms Baerbock wrote on X. The plane had to dump fuel in order to land back in Abu Dhabi safely. Owing to the mishap, Germany's Luftwaffe Air Force announced that it would retire the plane early. The government's other A340-300 will also be replaced. \"We will take the two #A340 out of service as soon as possible, ie in the coming weeks,\" it said in a post on X. Instead, top government officials will soon be using recently bought A350 planes.     \"With the A350s, the Air Force has robust and modern aircraft at its disposal for long-haul operations,\" the Luftwaffe said. In May Mexico also finally resolved a government plane problem: for more than four years it had failed to sell a luxury presidential jet, but in the end the Tajik government bought it.",

            "title": "Ethiopian Airlines: Africa's largest airline",
            "text": "Ethiopian Airlines has been shaken by the crash that killed 157 people, but it is widely recognized as Africa's most successful airline. Voted the Best Airline in Africa in 2018, the airline's triumphs are arguably down to reasonably priced tickets, efficient service delivery, a good safety record and a wide network of flights.  Ethiopian Airlines joined Star Alliance Network, an international airline network giving it access to more routes with partner airlines, in 2011. It is the largest airline in Africa and one of the few airlines turning a profit in the continent.  In the financial year 2017/2018, Ethiopian Airlines made profits of $245m (\u00a3187m) and carried 10.6 million people. Founded in 1945 by Ethiopia's last emperor Haile Selassie, with the hope of modernising and shaking off the country's poverty-stricken image, the inaugural flight to Cairo via Asmara took place in December that year.  It has since expanded and its fleet of 111 planes is larger than any other airline on the continent, flying to 106 international and 23 domestic destinations. Ethiopian was the first African airline to take delivery of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the 757 freighter and has invested in expanding and modernizing its fleet - and this has resulted in it having the youngest fleet in Africa.  The average age of the Ethiopian aircraft is just 5.4 years, compared to 13.5 for British Airways, 15 years for United Airlines and 10.7 for American Airlines. Ethiopian is one of the safest airlines in Africa, however there have been four major, deadly accidents or incidents involving the carrier. The last Ethiopian Airlines plane crash happened in 2010 when flight ET409 caught fire five minutes after take-off from Beirut and plummeted into the Mediterranean two miles off the Lebanese coast, killing all 89 passengers and crew.  A Lebanese investigation blamed pilot error for the crash but Ethiopian Airlines rejected the report, saying that the plane exploded, which according to their experts pointed to sabotage, a lightning strike or shooting down. In 1988 35 people died when an Ethiopian Airline plane's engines ingested pigeons and the aircraft caught fire during a belly-landing at Dahir Bar airport in Ethiopia. In 1996, a Boeing 767 was infamously hijacked and it ran out of fuel while flying from Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa to Nairobi, Kenya. The plane crash-landed in the Indian Ocean near the Comoros Islands, killing 125 of its 175 passengers. Beyond its own operations, the airline has also been helping other African national carriers. It revived and owns a 49% stake in Malawi Airlines and a 45% stake in Zambia Airways and has announced plans to help re-launch a new airline in Mozambique. It is also in talks to establish smaller regional bases in Djibouti, Chad, and Equatorial Guinea. It already operates hubs in Malawi and Togo. This strategy of reviving defunct national airlines, launching more connections and setting up more hubs across Africa has helped Ethiopian Airlines become a leader in its industry. \"Ethiopian has really come up with a very smart model for many years now,\" Max Kingsley-Jones, of aviation publisher FlightGlobal, told the BBC. \"Airline Business [magazine] gave Tewolde Gebremariam [CEO of Ethiopian Airlines] an award for being the best airline serving a particular market. The airline has very extensive network and their strategy of flying into Addis Ababa and then carrying people around the region of Africa, all over Africa, has proven successful\", he said. Ethiopian Airlines also has a good marketing strategy; it recently marked International Women's day by operating an all-female flight from Addis Ababa to Oslo. Recently, Ethiopia overtook Dubai as the biggest transfer hub for long-haul travel to Africa, according to findings by Spanish travel consultancy ForwardKeys. The undergoing expansion at Ethiopia's main airport, the Bole International airport, will further enhance the Ethiopian aviation industry's presence in Africa. Once completed, it will be able to accommodate up to 22 million passengers a year - overtaking South Africa's OR Tambo International airport in Johannesburg. But that is not enough for Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. At the opening ceremony of Ethiopia's largest hotel, adjacent to the airport in January, he said: \"We expect the Board and the Management [of Ethiopian Airlines] not to be complacent with the new terminal, but rather to aim for a bigger facility with a capacity to accommodate at least 100 million passengers.\"  While the crash is a massive shock to the airline, it will continue with its long-term vision.",

            "text": "Ryanair pilots based in Ireland have voted to strike for 24 hours on Thursday 12 July - the start of the traditional holidays in NI. It is likely to affect thousands of holidaymakers who travel to Dublin to take flights at that time of year. Although only pilots based in the Republic of Ireland voted to strike, the union has warned it could have knock-on effects for flights elsewhere. The dispute is over management's approach to transfers between bases. The Irish Airline Pilots' Association ballot of those directly employed by Ryanair resulted in overwhelming support - 99% - for action. The union claims Ryanair is not taking pilots' demands seriously. The 24-hour strike is due to begin at 01:00 on Thursday 12 July - the traditional holiday fortnight for hundreds of thousands of people in Northern Ireland. The union said it would notify the airline of additional strike days in due course. The union said its members felt there was no transparent system to address matters such as transfers between the airline's European and African bases, which can have a \"devastating effect on family life\". In a separate development, the International Transport Workers Federation is planning a two-day summit for Ryanair cabin crews across Europe, to be held in Dublin. It also warns of potential industrial action if Ryanair does not address its concerns. Meanwhile, the airline said air traffic control strikes meant 210,000 passengers faced flight cancellations in June. The carrier said more than 1,100 flights were cancelled for the second month running due to air traffic control strikes over four weekends in June, as well as staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France. This compared with just 41 cancellations in June last year. It repeated its call for action from Europe to help tackle disruption from the strikes. Despite the flight cancellations, the company pointed out that its load factor - a measure of how well airlines fill planes - remained unchanged at 96%. In May, Ryanair announced it was cutting its check-in time window from four days to 48 hours for passengers without reserved seats.  The airline said the move would give customers who have paid for reserved seating more time to pick their seats. Those customers will be allowed to check-in up to 60 days before flying. Seat allocation has become a hot topic for air passengers who suspect airlines of deliberately splitting up family groups in order to try to get them to pay for seats together. This is currently being investigated by the Civil Aviation Authority.",

            "title": "Iran plane crash: Cockpit exchange recorded after missile hit Ukraine jet",
            "text": "A black box recorder recovered from a Ukrainian passenger jet mistakenly shot down by Iran in January captured a conversation in the cockpit moments after a missile strike, officials say. Data from the Boeing 737 indicated that the pilots and passengers were alive before a second missile hit 25 seconds later, Iran's aviation authority said. The Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) flight crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran.  All 176 people on board were killed. After initially denying any responsibility for the incident, Iran admitted it had shot down the UIA flight \"unintentionally\", calling it a \"disastrous mistake\" by Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps. Iran's air defences had been on high alert at the time. Hours earlier, the country had fired ballistic missiles at two US bases in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani by a US drone strike in Baghdad. During a press conference on Sunday, Capt Zanganeh, head of the Civil Aviation Organisation of Iran (CAOI), said \"up to 19 seconds\" of conversation between two pilots and a pilot instructor had been captured in the aircraft's cabin after the first missile struck. It was \"25 seconds later that the second missile hit the plane\", he said, adding: \"They were piloting the plane until the last moment.\" He said information recorded by the plane's black boxes - which hold key data and communications from the cockpit - indicated that the aircraft had been \"in a normal flight corridor\" before the first missile exploded, sending shrapnel into the aircraft. Capt Zanganeh added: \"At this moment, the plane has an electrical problem and the auxiliary power of the plane is turned on at the order of the pilot instructor. Both engines were on in the seconds after the explosion. \"No sound was heard from the passenger cabin at that moment... The recording stopped after 19 seconds.\"  No details of the cockpit conversation were disclosed. Iran had delayed releasing the plane's \"black box\" voice recorder but in July sent it to France for examination. No other parties involved in the black box analysis have yet commented.  On 8 January, at 06:12 local time (02:42 GMT), UIA flight PS752 took off from Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran. The plane was a Boeing 737-800 - one of the international airline industry's most widely used aircraft models. Before leaving the airport's air space, the plane appeared to turn around to return to the runway. Shortly afterwards, it crashed. The government in Tehran initially said the UIA plane had suffered a technical problem shortly after take-off. It cited witnesses including the crew of another passenger plane who said it had been on fire prior to impact. Authorities said they had lost radar contact when the plane was at an altitude of about 8,000ft (2,400m), minutes after taking off. A later report by the CAOI said the air defence unit that targeted the passenger plane had recently moved and had failed to calibrate its equipment correctly. As a result, it misidentified the civilian plane as a hostile object. The report also said the missile battery had been unable to communicate with their command centre, and had fired on the plane without receiving official approval.",

            "title": "Boeing 737 Max cleared to fly in UK and EU after crashes",
            "text": "Boeing's 737 Max plane is safe to return to service in the UK and the European Union, regulators have said. It ends a 22-month flight ban for the jet, which followed two crashes which caused 346 deaths.  The plane had already been cleared to resume flying in North America and Brazil.  But this week a senior manager at Boeing's 737 plant in Seattle warned that recertification had happened too quickly. Regulators in the US and Europe insist their reviews have been thorough, and that the 737 Max aircraft is now safe. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (Easa), which regulates aviation in 31 mainly EU countries, said it now had \"every confidence\" in the plane following an independent review. \"But we will continue to monitor 737 Max operations closely as the aircraft resumes service,\" said executive director Patrick Ky. \"In parallel, and at our insistence, Boeing has also committed to work to enhance the aircraft still further in the medium term, in order to reach an even higher level of safety.\" The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which oversees UK aviation now Britain has left the EU, said the work to return the 737 Max to the skies had been \"the most extensive project of this kind\".  It said it was in close contact with Tui, currently the only UK operator of the aircraft, as it returned the plane to service.  \"As part of this we will have full oversight of the airline's plans including its pilot training programmes and implementation of the required aircraft modifications.\" The 737 Max's first accident occurred in October 2018, when a Lion Air jet came down in the sea off Indonesia. The second involved an Ethiopian Airlines version that crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, just four months later. Both have been attributed to flawed flight control software, which became active at the wrong time and prompted the aircraft to go into a catastrophic dive. Easa said it had done a full investigation independent of Boeing or the US Federal Aviation Administration and \"without any economic or political pressure\". As a result, it demanded software upgrades, electrical working rework, maintenance checks, operations manual updates and crew training.  \"We asked difficult questions until we got answers and pushed for solutions which satisfied our exacting safety requirements,\" Mr Ky said.   The CAA said it had based its decision on information from Easa, the US Federal Aviation Agency and Boeing, as well as \"extensive engagement\" with airline operators and pilots.  It comes days after a report by Ed Pierson, a former Boeing manager, claimed that regulators and investigators had largely ignored factors that may have played a direct role in the accidents.  Mr Pierson said that further investigation of electrical issues and production quality problems at the 737 factory in Seattle was badly needed. On Wednesday Naoise Connolly Ryan, whose husband Mick died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, said that the families of victims \"still do not have a full accounting of what happened and why\". \"Ultimately we are more determined than ever to find out exactly what Boeing knew about this dangerous aircraft, and hold them accountable for the deaths of our loved ones.\" Boeing has already agreed to pay $2.5bn (\u00a31.8bn) to settle US criminal charges that it hid information from safety officials about the design of the planes. The US Justice Department said the firm chose \"profit over candour\", impeding oversight of the planes. About $500m of that will go to families of the people killed in the tragedies. However, attorneys for the victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash have said the deal would not end their pending civil lawsuit against Boeing. On Wednesday, Boeing posted a record $12bn annual loss after it delayed its all-new 777X jet for the third time, incurring huge charges.  The coronavirus crisis has caused demand for the industry's largest jetliners to fall, with airline customers shunning deliveries of planes due international travel restrictions. The 737 Max has already been cleared to fly in North America and Brazil - now it has the go-ahead from European regulators as well. It's a major step for Boeing - although with the current travel restrictions in place, it's likely to be a while before the decision has much practical effect. But the controversy won't end there. Relatives of those who died in the Ethiopian Airlines accident have made it clear they haven't heard enough to be sure the aircraft - modified in accordance with regulators' wishes - is truly safe. And this week, a former senior manager at the 737 factory told the BBC why he thought existing planes might still be carrying potentially dangerous manufacturing defects. That may explain why Easa has also chosen to publish a report setting out the detailed reasoning behind its decision. Ultimately, the 737 Max may we'll have decades of successful service ahead of it. But for the moment, winning back passenger confidence will be a formidable challenge.",

            "text": "When he was finally rescued from the wreckage of a British Midland jet after the Kegworth air disaster, Stephen McCoy was given little chance of survival. His injuries were so severe he did not regain consciousness for 18 months and he spent the next three years in hospital. The crash happened on 8 January 1989, after a Boeing 737 developed a problem in the left engine, shortly after leaving Heathrow for Aldergrove - Belfast's main airport.  The pilots shut down the wrong engine and the plane crashed on the M1 in Leicestershire - just short of East Midlands Airport, where they were attempting an emergency landing. Forty seven of the 126 people on board were killed; 74 were seriously injured. At the time, Stephen was a 16-year-old boxing champion and a keen punk music fan with spiked, bleached hair. When he eventually got out of hospital, his sister Yvonne gave up work to become his full-time carer at their home in Toomebridge.  Thirty years later, Yvonne remembers that it was hours after the crash before they were told that her brother was still alive. \"The sight I saw, I would not wish it on anybody, he did not know anybody, he was in a coma. He was thin, lifeless, with a massive dent in the head. \"I was with him on the day he came out of the coma and it was the best day of my life.\" Rose McCoy, Stephen's mother, recalls how slow the process was. \"He started to come out of the coma bit by bit and he would have pulled himself up and looked all around him, but if you'd done that (she waves her hand in front of her face) he would not have blinked, he would not have known you were there, he just was trying to get out of the coma,\" she said. Stephen was left with brain damage and paralysis down one side. Brendan Heffron, a teenage friend of Stephen's, said what happened shook both teenagers badly. They shared a passion for punk, and Brendan still stays in touch with his friend. \"It is sad to think he could be married and should have kids,\" said Brendan. \"The rest of us just basically got on the same way about our trades, our businesses, raised our families.  Stephen was pretty much the same. He was very like-minded with the rest of us.\" Yvonne said that, despite the crash, Stephen still flew to Lourdes every year. \"Stephen's faith is extremely strong. His faith has grown since the accident and he takes a regular trip every year in July to Lourdes - that is the highlight of Stephen's year. \"Every year that he goes to Lourdes he has to get on a plane, but Stephen is very brave.  \"He says 'this plane is not going to crash', because he puts his faith in God.  \"He has no fear.\" Stephen said: \"I'm able to pray and meet people and friends I have met before and get on well with. It gives me great hope to hurry up and get out of this chair for good.\" Stephen still uses a wheelchair, but has recently been working towards being able to walk, using an exoskeleton to hold him upright and propel him forward. Physio Kim Gregg, who is helping Stephen, described him as \"the ideal patient\". \"He has a zest for life and a zest for improvement,\" said Kim. Despite the setbacks over three decades, the family has never given up hope for his recovery. \"I always had hope, which is amazing, because the knockbacks that Stephen has had, he never, ever lost hope,\" she said. \"But you always have to have hope. If you have no hope you have nothing.\" Stephen McCoy My Fight to Live is on BBC One NI at 22:40 GMT on Monday 7 January.",

There is as yet no indication of what caused the crash but the aircraft is believed to have experienced technical problems on its previous flight. The plane was making a one-hour journey to the western city of Pangkal Pinang when it went down. The pilot had asked air traffic control for permission to turn back to the airport but then contact was lost.  Initial reports said the plane's flight data recorder had been found but a transport safety official quoted by Reuters news agency said later it was unclear whether the damaged device was the flight data unit or the cockpit voice recorder.    \"Tonight we will move as quickly as possible to download what is in this black box,\" Haryo Satmiko, deputy chief of Indonesia's transportation safety committee, told journalists. It could take up to six months to analyse data from the black boxes, officials from Indonesia's transportation safety committee have said. Mr Satmiko pointed to the device's poor condition as evidence of the \"extraordinary impact\" of the crash. A diver identified as Hendra said the box had been buried in debris on the floor of the Java Sea. Another official, Muhammad Syaugi, said part of the plane's landing gear had been found, AFP news agency reports. \"We have found bigger parts of the plane than we have seen in previous days,\" he added. A log obtained by the BBC shows the plane experienced technical problems while flying from Bali to Jakarta the previous day. The log shows one instrument was giving \"unreliable\" airspeed readings and the captain had to hand over to the first officer. Altitude readings also differed on the captain's and first officer's instruments. Lion Air, a budget airline based in Indonesia, has acknowledged a technical problem occurred on the penultimate flight but said it was resolved \"according to procedure\".  The company has sacked its technical director, Muhammad Asif. Representatives from Boeing are also meeting Indonesian officials as part of the investigation.  Meanwhile, search officials are continuing the grim task of gathering body parts found at the crash site and taking them to land for identification.   On Wednesday night, the funeral was held of the first identified victim, a 24-year-old woman who worked in the engineering ministry.",

            "text": "Pilot error and failure to follow safety guidelines probably led to the crash of an Air India Express plane in August last year, investigators say. The passenger plane with 190 people on board crashed at the Calicut airport in the southern state of Kerala, killing 21 people.  The Boeing 737, which had flown from Dubai, skidded off the runway in rain and broke in two after landing.  The flight was repatriating Indians stranded by the coronavirus crisis. The dead included both pilots. Seventy-five passengers were seriously injured.  The aircraft crashed as it attempted to land for a second time. The first attempt was aborted by the pilots because of the heavy monsoon-season rainfall lashing Kerala. The report by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau said there were several \"violations\" of operation procedures before landing by the pilot.  They include that not carrying out \"adequate briefing\" for landing with tailwinds in rain and poor visibility, as well as failure to \"quickly calculate accurate landing data in adverse weather conditions\", contributed to the crash.  A malfunctioning windshield wiper had also impaired visibility, the 257-page report said.    The pilot also \"did not make the mandatory announcement for the cabin crew to be seated on the first approach for landing... This is a very serious omission and compromises cabin crew\", the report said. The report added that \"systemic failures\" could have also contributed to the crash. \"These usually occur due to prevailing safety culture that give rise to errors, mistakes and violation of routine tasks performed by people operating within the system,\" it said.  Plane crashes have happened before during the monsoon season, in India which lasts from June to September and wreaks havoc across south Asia every year. In May 2010, 158 people died when an Air India Express flight overshot Mangalore airport runway and crashed.",

            "text": "A Boeing jet has drawn an outline of a plane by flying over America using GPS tracking. During the stunt, the 787 Dreamliner travelled further than any other commercial route in operation around the world. When it landed in Seattle, it had travelled 9,755 miles - compared to the 9,021-mile distance between Auckland and Doha. It was also in the air longer than any current route. The Boeing test flight was in the air for 17 hours and 45 minutes compared to 16 hours, 10 minutes between New Zealand to Qatar. This is the final map of the Dreamliner's test run. The flight stayed entirely within the US border and travelled from Washington State, across to Lake Superior before crossing above at least 17 states. Some Twitter users have been criticising the company for wasting fuel and damaging the environment. But industry experts say Boeing's using the long flight to test a new set of Rolls Royce engines. It landed at Boeing Field, or King County International Airport in Seattle, on Thursday morning. Using GPS technology to create pictures is not new but this is surely the biggest so far. Canadian cyclist Stephen Lund is one of a number of \"Strava artists\" who use the popular cycling app to create images. He's ridden thousands of miles to create his images, like the ones below.

Plane G-GDFP had \"a flap indication alert\" on a flight that departed Larnaca late on Monday for Leeds. It landed safely on Tuesday morning. The same plane, flying from Crete to Leeds, was diverted to Manchester with the same problem last Thursday. Jet2.com's engineering team is working with the manufacturer Boeing \"to resolve this issue\", the company said. Flaps are used to extend the surface area of an aircraft's wing during take-off and landing, to generate more lift at the slower speeds associated with those phases of the flight.

Last Thursday, while flying from Heraklion, in Crete, the plane was diverted from Leeds to Manchester as a \"precautionary matter\" due to its longer runway, the firm previously said.",

            "text": "Qantas has announced it will begin operating non-stop flights from Sydney to London and New York from 2025. Australia's national carrier said it had purchased a new fleet of Airbus A350-1000 jets capable of direct flights to any city in the world. The first Sydney-London flights will depart in late 2025 and take about 20 hours, making them the world's longest passenger flights. The route, launched in 1947, once took 58 hours and seven stops. \"It's the last frontier and the final fix for the tyranny of distance,\" chief executive Alan Joyce said in a statement. Qantas has been working on the plan - dubbed Project Sunrise - for about five years, but implementation has been delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2018 it began offering direct 17-hour direct flights between London and Perth in Western Australia, and in 2019 it conducted a series of test flights from the east coast to the UK and New York. The new fleet of 12 planes will begin arriving in 2025, with the order to be completed by 2028. The airline did not say how much it would charge for seats in its four classes: first, business, premium economy and economy.  Each plane will be able to carry 238 passengers with 40% of the cabin dedicated to premium seating. Seats will be roomier than usual, Qantas says. Travellers will also be able to access a \"wellbeing zone\" in the centre of the plane - with a self-service snack bar and space for stretching and movement - to combat the effects of spending 20 hours in the air. Paul Charles, a former Virgin Atlantic communications director, told BBC News the success of the route relied on a cheaper price to attract travellers - who would otherwise break their journey with a stop in the Middle East.  Mr Charles, who now runs a travel consultancy, said: \"It's fine if you're in business class and at the front of the plane with more space, but if you're flying economy most people will want to break their journey and it would be a very tough 20-hour flight.  He predicted a price war over fares between Europe and Australia - as Middle East airlines operating out of hubs like Dubai and Doha face down the threat from Qantas and its direct service. Qantas could also have a challenge on its hands to make the flight comfortable and entertaining for passengers, Mr Charles added, as well as ensuring their wellbeing. Asked whether other airlines could follow Qantas' lead in launching ultra-long haul flights, he said: \"The question is in 2025 when this is due to launch, what will the world look like?\" \"Will we want to fly such long-haul routes or will consumers want to fly short-haul on more environmentally friendly flights that are shorter in duration?\" The experience of ultra-long haul flying can be \"brutal on the body\", according to travel YouTuber Noel Philips. Mr Philips has flown 18 hours on a non-stop Qatar Airways flight from Auckland to Doha, and 16 hours on a non-stop Qantas flight from London to Perth. \"The problem is you're sort of stuck in one position for such a long period of time,\" he said. \"Especially with some of the older aircraft, there's the issue of dehydration on the body as well, which can take it out of you.  \"But the airlines are recognising these flights can be brutal on the body and doing things to make it a bit easier. \"You were getting smoothies to help with your hydration... and the entertainment Qantas had on their Perth route was really good.\" He said he reckoned there would be \"incredible demand\" for the service due to the family and business ties between the UK and Australia.  \"If people can do a non-stop flight, I think people will prefer to do a non-stop flight to Australia,\" he added.  \"With a stopover somewhere it's just prolonging the whole experience and it turns into a bit of a faff.\" Currently Qantas operates non-stop flights between UK and Australia, with Boeing 787s linking London's Heathrow Airport and the Northern Territory city of Darwin.  The flight from Australia takes about 17 hours, and the return journey is about 16 hours long. ",

            "text": "At least 17 people were injured on board a SpiceJet flight in India after the plane hit severe turbulence before landing on Sunday evening. The Boeing 737, carrying about 200 passengers and crew, was travelling from Mumbai to Durgapur. Amit Baul, who was on the flight, recounts the ordeal. This article contains an image some readers may find distressing  It was a warm Sunday evening in Mumbai when we took off at 5.13 pm for a two-hour-flight to the eastern city of Durgapur, where I live and work as a businessman.  There was nothing out of the ordinary during the flight: the plane was packed to capacity, food was served on time and passengers were either dozing or glued to their mobile phones. I had flown between Mumbai and Durgapur half-a-dozen times in the last four months, and preferred SpiceJet because it offers a non-stop flight.   Thirty five minutes before the scheduled landing I felt some light turbulence. Again, nothing unusual about that. I was seated in an aisle seat in the last row, and fastened my seat belt.  But as we began descending things got worse. The next 15-17 minutes were the worst moments of my life. I don't know whether we flew into a storm but the plane began bouncing up and down and sideways. The Boeing 737 was going up and down like a rubber ball.  It felt like being dropped from a 100-storey building and then being kicked up to those heights in a matter of seconds. I tightened my seat belt and held on tightly to the seat handle. I saw passengers, who had possibly forgotten to fasten their belts, being bounced up and down from their seats and hitting the overhead baggage bins. They were getting severely hurt. Two men sitting next to me also got a little hurt because they possibly hadn't tightened their belts.   Sitting in front of me was a woman with her 11-year-old daughter. They were flung up from their seats a number of times, with their heads hitting the luggage bin. The final time, the woman came down and landed on my feet, which were sticking out into the aisle. She was so badly hurt that she stayed on the floor, clinging on to the seat handles.  Passengers were crying and shouting. Some began praying. I tried to look out of the window and noticed it was dark. The pilot kept announcing that passengers should put on their seat belts.  It was complete mayhem. The food waste from the galley was flying out - leftovers and beverage cups and cans choked the isles. A few food trays and seat handles had come off.  The oxygen panels had opened and the masks had dropped down. So many people got hurt, I saw blood stains on the ceiling. Passengers frantically asked for ice to reduce pain and swelling from their wounds.  \"Do something fast, ma'am,\" a passenger asked a harried air-hostess as she sprinted down the aisle to help a passenger.  \"Just pray, keep praying,\" another passenger said. There was a time when I felt I wouldn't make it home. When the plane finally landed at 7.15pm, I felt like I had returned from the jaws of death.  We thanked the pilots profusely and stepped out into a hot summer evening in Durgapur. But the worst was to yet come.  It took an hour for the ambulances to arrive and take away the injured passengers to the hospital. There were no doctors in sight.  A paramedic of sorts was giving out painkillers and putting on bandages. There weren't enough wheelchairs. Many passengers limped to the arrival hall. It was clear that the airport in Durgapur had no basic medical facilities. When I went to the hospital later in the evening to get an X-ray of a swelling in my foot, I saw many of my fellow passengers getting treated for wounds and getting scans. I found out that the woman in the front seat had suffered very severe injuries in her stomach and shoulders. (India's civil aviation regulator has ordered an investigation into the incident. In a statement it said that the plane had experienced \"severe turbulence\" during descent, and the \"auto-pilot got disengaged for two minutes and the crew manually flew the aircraft\".)",

            "text": "Fifteen protesters who chained themselves to a plane to stop it deporting people to Africa have avoided immediate jail sentences. Dubbed the Stansted 15, the group broke through a fence at the airport in a bid to reach the jet taking 60 people to Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone. They were found guilty of endangering the safety of an aerodrome. Three were given suspended jail terms and 12 received community orders at Chelmsford Crown Court. The group has said they will appeal against their convictions, which they believe have serious implications for the freedom to protest. They used bolt cutters to enter Stansted Airport and attached themselves to the Boeing 767 using tubes and expanding foam on 28 March 2017. The runway was closed for more than an hour and 23 incoming flights had to be diverted to other airports. Passing sentence, Judge Christopher Morgan told the 15 that while he accepted the group were seeking to demonstrate in support of their cause, they had come \"perilously close\" to causing a catastrophe. He said: \"In normal circumstances only a normal custodial sentence would have been justified in this case, but in your case I accept that your intentions were to demonstrate.\" \"There is no doubt that you understood that there were safety implications,\" he added.  \"You put at risk the safe operations of the airport and the persons who were there on the night.\" By Dominic Casciani, BBC Home Affairs correspondent In court, the judge faced some tough arguments from a top human rights barrister about his duties to balance the question of airport security with the need to protect freedom of speech and assembly. Judge Morgan said he did this through tempering his sentences - in other circumstances, he said, he would have jailed the lot of them.  Some of the defendants looked jubilant and defiant. Others looked like defendants often do: exhausted by the process, somewhat remorseful and promising never to do it again.  So if the Court of Appeal decides not to examine the convictions, this prosecution will stand as a warning to others of the type of charge they could face for endangering an airport.   Read more from Dominic here Three of the defendants, Edward Thacker, Alistair Tamlit and Melanie Strickland were given nine-month jail sentences, suspended for 18 months. The other 12 received 12-month community orders, with 11 of them ordered to carry out unpaid work. All 15 were convicted on 10 December last year under the 1990 Aviation and Maritime Security Act, which was brought in after the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. The defendants had said they were being prosecuted under the \"little known\" legislation, originally devised to combat terrorism and hjijacking. In a statement, the Crown Prosecution Service said it was never suggested to the jury that any of the 15 were terrorists. Prosecutor Tony Badenoch said the Crown would not be recouping the financial deficit caused by the protest; estimated to be more than \u00a31m. New mother Emma Hughes, who gave birth between being convicted and sentenced, said the group were \"massively relieved\" none of them would be going to jail. She said: \"It is a massive vindication of what we did. There are 11 people still in the UK because of the action we took.  Three of them have now been granted leave to remain; there is one man here who would have been separated from his family and is now here with his family. We are going to keep fighting until we get these convictions overturned.\" Hundreds of people turned out to a demonstration outside the court, with crowds singing, clapping and waving banners. The courtroom was packed for the hearing, with extra space created in the public gallery and all seats filled. The 15 sentenced are: ",

            "title": "737 Max: Boeing refutes new safety concerns",
            "text": "It has been called \"the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history\", but some critics believe Boeing's 737 Max is still not safe. It was cleared to fly passengers again by US regulators last year, having been grounded following two catastrophic accidents. Since then, however, a number of potentially serious problems have been reported during 737 Max flights. Boeing insists the aircraft is both safe and reliable. On 14 October, a 737 Max took off from Boeing Field airport in Seattle, bound for Brussels. It was a delivery flight, taking the brand-new plane to start work for its owners, the travel group Tui. But minutes into the 5,000-mile journey, the pilots reported an urgent \"flight control problem\" and had to turn back. The aircraft landed safely shortly afterwards. The issue, linked to the autopilot, was rectified relatively quickly. The plane set off for Brussels again the following day, and has been flying regularly since then.  However, this was not an isolated incident.  Whenever a US carrier or repair station discovers any serious failure, malfunction or defect aboard an aircraft, it has to inform the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), via a so-called \"service difficulty report\". There have been more than 180 such reports since the 737 Max returned to service.  Most faults were found on planes that were on the ground. But on 22 occasions, they occurred in-flight, and on four of those the pilots declared emergencies. US pilots also declared emergencies on two further occasions due to engine failures.  These events do not currently appear in the FAA's database, but have been reported on the Aviation Herald website, which lists accidents and incidents in commercial aviation. The problems occurred in a US fleet that is still relatively small, with fewer than 160 aircraft delivered as of mid-October - some of which were grounded for several weeks early in the year after the discovery of electrical issues. Service difficulty reports are also made public by the Canadian regulator, Transport Canada. Its database shows that the Canadian fleet of 56 737 Max aircraft has generated 19 reports, five of them relating to in-flight incidents. The 737 Max remains under intense scrutiny. The plane was grounded for 20 months from March 2019, after being involved in two major accidents, in which 346 people died. Its flight control software was modified, to remove a serious flaw implicated in both crashes. Other physical changes were made to the aircraft. It is important to stress that none of the issues reported to the FAA and Transport Canada are directly related either to the causes of these crashes, or to the changes made afterwards. But they do include problems with some critical systems, including the motors used to adjust the horizontal stabiliser - the wing on the tailplane of the aircraft.  There have also been faults with engines, flight control systems, hydraulics and wiring. The horizontal stabiliser, in particular, is vital for keeping the aircraft in controlled flight. It can be adjusted manually, using a wheel by the pilot's knee. But under certain conditions, for example if the aircraft is going too fast, that may not be possible due to the aerodynamic loads involved. Joe Jacobsen is a former senior safety engineer at the FAA, which has been deeply critical of the way in which the agency originally certified the 737 Max.  He says the reports do give cause for concern, particularly regarding the stabiliser motors, wiring and flight control systems. Such issues, he says, are most likely to be blamed on manufacturing.  \"If they are not manufacturing-related\", he says \"then we have a problem with the system safety analysis, as I don't believe we would have predicted this number of failures is such a short time span with such a small fleet of aircraft.\" Gilles Primeau, a Canadian expert in flight control systems, is also alarmed. He has previously testified to Canadian lawmakers that in his opinion the stabiliser trim system on all 737 variants, not just the Max, is \"obsolete\", and does not have enough in-built redundancy in case of failures. He says \"a fundamental concept for safety-critical systems is that if the effects and severity of a failure cause a hazard, then the frequency of occurrence should be made infrequent enough by design... loss of horizontal stabiliser position can be catastrophic\". Ed Pierson is a former senior manager at Boeing's 737 plant, near Seattle, who has previously voiced serious concerns about manufacturing standards at the plant. He says the number of failure and defect reports is \"very troubling\". \"I'm concerned this is just the tip of the iceberg\", he says, adding: \"It makes one wonder what the airline's own maintenance reports say about the condition of these airplanes, if the mandatory reporting looks like this.\" However, not all experts are so alarmed. Dai Whittingham, chief executive of the UK Flight Safety Committee, has also seen the data.  \"I don't think it's an unreasonable rate of occurrences,\" he explains. \"With a fleet that size, it's not an unexpected level of problems, for the length of time. \"They are complex systems, so these things happen\" Boeing did not respond to specific questions about the failures featured in the service difficulty reports.  In a statement, it said: \"Since the 737 Max returned to service, airlines have flown nearly 240,000 flights around the world, and are conducting more than 1,300 flights every day. \"The in-service reliability is greater than 99%, and is consistent with other commercial airplane models\". People close to the 737 Max programme do, however, acknowledge that there have been specific issues with stabiliser trim motors, and that changes have been made to rectify them. The BBC also understands that regular weekly meetings take place between the aerospace giant and representatives of the engine manufacturer CFM International, in part to address the root causes of failures and in-flight shutdowns. The FAA, meanwhile, said: \"When we returned the 737 Max to service, we noted that routine incidents would occur with the aircraft, just as they do with every other make and model of aircraft. \"The FAA addresses these issues through the same Continued Operational Safety process that we provide for the entire US commercial fleet. We have seen no reported incidents attributable to the redesigned automated flight control system on the Max.\"",

            "title": "Sonic boom heard across Derbyshire caused by RAF Typhoons",
            "text": "A sonic boom was heard across Derbyshire as military aircraft were launched to intercept a passenger plane following a reported bomb threat. Police and the fire service received \"a large number\" of 999 calls from people who feared there had been an explosion or earthquake. Some people reported their homes being shaken by the sonic boom, which was heard shortly before 10:00 BST. The RAF confirmed Typhoon aircraft had been launched. \"The RAF can confirm Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon aircraft were launched this morning from RAF Coningsby to intercept a civilian aircraft,\" a statement said. \"The aircraft was safely escorted to Stansted Airport. The Typhoon aircraft were authorised to transit at supersonic speed for operational reasons; any inconvenience caused to local residents is regretted.\" Claire Murray, who lives in Breaston, was filming her dog Tala about to go in a paddling pool when she heard the sonic boom. \"It scared everyone because it's such a quiet area,\" she said. \"We thought there was a major explosion somewhere. \"It made the whole house shake. The dogs ran into the house scared and the birds were flying everywhere.\" When an aircraft approaches the speed of sound (768mph or 1,236km/h), the air in front of the nose of the plane builds up a pressure front because it has \"nowhere to escape\", said Dr Jim Wild of Lancaster University. A sonic boom happens when that air \"escapes\", creating a ripple effect which can be heard on the ground as a loud thunderclap.  It can be heard over such a large area because it moves with the plane, rather like the wake on the bow of a ship spreading out behind the vessel. Bob Billington, who lives in Derby, said he heard two bangs in quick succession and guessed it was a sonic boom. \"The first bang was rather loud, like the thunder from a very close lightning strike, then rather less than a second later there was a second, not quite as loud, and then the echoes from the surrounding buildings making it sound like a fairly short roll of thunder,\" he said. \"I assume there aren't very many of the people reporting it have actually heard one before, so I can understand their reactions.\" Stuart Dean, who works at a car dealership near Pride Park, said it \"felt like the whole world shook\". \"It felt like the whole thing came from behind us so we all rushed out to see what it was,\" he said. \"We're in a really big unit and the whole thing shook.\" The RAF said it could not say how many Typhoons were launched \"for operational reasons\". They were escorting an Air India passenger plane that made a \"precautionary landing\" after the airline initially reported a bomb threat. A statement from Stansted Airport said the plane landed at about 10:15 BST and was in an isolated part of the airport. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

            "title": "Ryanair given deadline to obey compensation rules",
            "text": "Ryanair has been told to correct its compensation policy for passengers by Friday afternoon after thousands of its flights were cancelled. The UK's Civil Aviation Authority says the airline must stop misleading passengers about the option to be re-routed with another airline. The regulator has ordered the budget airline to say publicly how it will re-route passengers who require it. Ryanair must also say how it will reimburse their out-of-pocket expenses. Passengers left 'furious' at Ryanair Regulator 'fury' over Ryanair law breach Ryanair: the 34 routes being suspended Ryanair cancellations: What are my rights? In addition, the airline must promise to help any of the passengers whose flights have been cancelled in the past two weeks, but who may have chosen an unsuitable option as a result of being misled by Ryanair, the regulator said.  The demands - which must be completed by 17:00 BST on Friday - cover passengers who were due to fly to and from the UK. The CAA said if the airline did not meet the deadline, it would carry on with the \"enforcement action\" launched on Wednesday, which could ultimately see the airline taken to court, with the possibility of an unlimited fine. The airline recently cancelled flights affecting more than 700,000 passengers, from now until next March, in two separate tranches, because it had bungled the reorganisation of its pilots' leave arrangements. The CAA has asked Ryanair to change details on its website by the deadline, saying: \"There is still no information here about how expenses will be treated where passengers are re-routed to and/or from other airports or where they otherwise incur additional out-of-pocket expenses as a result of the cancellations.\" \"Further changes are therefore required to make it clear that any such expenses will be reimbursed by Ryanair\". Demanding an end to Ryanair's \"ongoing infringements\" of the EU rules, the CAA said Ryanair had still failed to supply information requested a week ago on its refund and rerouting policy. The regulator said it was \"especially interested\" in how the airline's call centre staff had been dealing with passengers. Evidence seen by the BBC suggests that some travellers have been denied their rights. For instance, in a web chat with Ryanair on Thursday, a passenger called Matthew Rice said: \"You are obligated to re-route me as advised in the CAA's open letter to you and Ryanair's policy on the cancellations as provided to you.\" The Ryanair call centre employee replied: \"No I am not. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\" The airline said it had reminded its call centre staff on Wednesday about its formal policy, which states that passengers can be re-booked on another airline so long as the cost is not more than three times that of the original Ryanair fare. The regulator has also imposed a further deadline on the airline to rectify the misleading information given to passengers during the past two weeks. New emails must be sent to them giving \"accurate and comprehensive information on their rights and options\". Ryanair must offer them again the option of a refund or re-routing, including one with another airline, and tell them how to make a claim for expenses. Travellers who have accepted a refund must be offered a reimbursement of the difference with any higher fare. And those who have been misled into accepting an unsatisfactory re-routing must be offered the option of changing it. Passengers in the second group of cancellations, covering November to March, must have the option of being re-routed with another airline highlighted as an alternative Ryanair flight may not be available. All the new emails must be sent out by 17:00 BST on 4 October, after first being checked and approved by the CAA.",

            "title": "Theresa May pledges to boost aerospace amid Brexit fears",
            "text": "Theresa May has promised extra investment for the aerospace industry, just weeks after Airbus threatened to reduce its UK presence because of Brexit disruption.  The prime minister also said that her Brexit plan would secure millions of aviation jobs in Britain. It comes amid growing criticism of her plan from MPs, with another government member resigning in protest on Sunday. The proposal urges close links with the EU on trade in goods, but not services. In a speech at the Farnborough Airshow on Monday, she offered more than \u00a3300m of government and industry money for several projects, including research on more environmentally-friendly aircraft.  There will be additional money for two new spaceports - one in Cornwall, one in Scotland - and a long-awaited commitment to build a new high-tech fighter aircraft that will eventually replace the Eurofighter Typhoon. The UK aviation sector generates turnover of about \u00a360bn and supports almost a million jobs. British aerospace exports alone were worth \u00a330bn in 2017. However, industry trade association ADS has warned the sector could be paralysed if Britain leaves the EU customs union and single market, given its dependence on cross-border trade in components.  In June, Airbus UK boss Tom Enders said it could pull production out of the UK if it quit the bloc without a transition deal. The French firm employs about 14,000 people in Britain. However, last week, Mr Enders tentatively welcomed Mrs May's plan, saying the government is now moving in the right direction.  But in an interview with the BBC, the boss of Airbus's arch-rival, Boeing, pledged to keep investing in Britain.  Dennis Muilenberg said while the company did not welcome disruption to the movement of goods - or to the Europe-wide systems of aviation regulation - his company's plans would not be changed by the UK's plans to leave the EU. \"We are going to continue to grow in the UK,\" he said, adding that Boeing would maintain a long-term view of its UK investments, \"regardless of how Brexit plays out\". However, he added there were worries over whether \"we continue to see free flow of goods and services\". In her speech, Mrs May argued that her proposals - including frictionless free trade in goods and the avoidance of a hard border in Northern Ireland - would protect the supply chains that big aerospace firms depend on. She also said the UK could remain part of EU agencies critical for the aerospace industry, such as the European Aviation Safety Agency. \"By working closely together, government and industry have ensured we remain at the forefront of civil aviation and that our air power is second to none,\" she said. \"Today I want us to build on that, and ensure not only that we retain our prominence, but that in an increasingly competitive industry we make the most of the opportunities that lie ahead.\" ADS has welcomed the government's plan, but insists there are important and complex issues still to be resolved. However, chief executive Paul Everitt said the prime minister's remarks were a \"strong statement of intent\" that would help build confidence and encourage investment.  \"The international political, military and business leaders visiting Farnborough will be reassured by last week's Brexit White Paper and are keen to hear more about the UK's post-Brexit ambitions.\"",

            "title": "The Beast: How Biden's getting around on his first overseas trip",
            "text": "US President Joe Biden is heading to Switzerland for the final leg of his first official overseas trip. His eight-day visit to Europe - which has included a G7 leaders' meeting in the UK, an audience with the Queen and his first Nato summit as president - concludes by meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva. Mr Biden does not travel lightly. The US president has an array of speciality vehicles to help him move around in safety and comfort, on land and in the air.  And none is more iconic than the presidential plane - Air Force One. The aircraft landed at RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk on Wednesday, where Mr Biden met US personnel stationed there before flying to Cornwall.  As the White House website explains, Air Force One is actually the air traffic control sign for any Air Force aircraft with the US president on board. But for the most part the term is used to refer to the two famous white and blue planes - specially adapted Boeing 747-200B series aircraft - which carry the tail codes 28000 and 29000. The planes have advanced communications, avionics and defences - including protection against electromagnetic pulses and flares to throw off heat-seeking missiles - which mean they can function as an airborne, mobile command centre in case of an attack on the US.  They are also capable of refuelling in the air, meaning in theory the planes have unlimited range. Inside, there is 4,000 sq feet (372 sq m) of floor space spread over three levels. Aside from a presidential suite, there are also medical facilities, food galleys, and space for advisers, Secret Service protection officers and journalists. For short trips in the air, the president uses a helicopter - recognisable by its predominantly green body and white top. Marine One - again, not just one helicopter, but the name for any Marine Corps aircraft carrying the US president - usually refers to a VH-3D Sea King or a VH-60N White Hawk. Decoy versions of Marine One often fly alongside the president's helicopter. It is also usually accompanied in the air by escort aircraft, including the Osprey MV-22 - known as a \"Green Top\".  UK readers may remember the tilt-rotor aircraft flying over London during former President Donald Trump's visit in 2018. They are capable of vertical take-off and landing, and are designed to combine the functions of a helicopter with the range of a turboprop aircraft. Once on the ground, President Biden usually transfers from Air Force One or Marine One to Cadillac One - nicknamed The Beast. The 5.5-metre-long (18ft) Beast can hold at least seven people and has a wide range of medical supplies on board, including a fridge with blood matching the president's blood type, in case of an emergency. The newest generation of the Beast debuted in 2018. Manufacturer General Motors and the Secret Service have not given much away about the car's specific security features. But reports suggest it weighs about nine tonnes (20,000lb), and has an armour-plated body and bulletproof windows.  It reportedly has tear gas grenade launchers, night vision cameras and a built-in satellite phone. The passenger cabin is said to be sealed, and the tyres are reinforced so the car can still move even with flat tyres.  However for the Cornwall leg of this trip, the president has so far chosen to ditch The Beast, opting to use an SUV instead.  Secret Service agents had already travelled to Cornwall to scout out the location of the G7 summit - looking for the best route through the narrow country lanes. Former President Barack Obama's visit to Downing Street in 2009 became a viral hit after the presidential limousine struggled to turn in the famous street. The driver on another trip in 2016 was more successful. Access is strictly controlled to Carbis Bay on Cornwall's north coast, where global leaders are gathering.  The world's seven largest so-called advanced economies take part in G7 summits. Aside from the US, this includes the UK, France, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada. The EU is also represented. ",

            "title": "Fume events: The toxic gases that may be harming aircrew and passengers",
            "text": "An incident in January, when a pilot became unresponsive at the controls of a plane coming in to land at Heathrow, is just the latest in a string of potentially dangerous \"fume events\" going back decades, reports the BBC's Mike Powell. This year, 2020, was only hours old when a British Airways captain issued a Mayday emergency call to the control tower at London's Heathrow Airport. Just minutes from landing BA633 from Athens on the evening of 2 January, his co-pilot - the first officer - had slumped at the controls. They were experiencing a \"fume event\", when toxic air enters the aircraft. The BBC has seen the Air Safety Report (ASR) of that event. BA threatens staff with disciplinary action - or even the sack - if they reveal the contents of such confidential reports, but one of them has risked it, arguing that the truth needs to be known.  In the ASR the captain notes that he experienced strong smells and then became concerned that his co-pilot wasn't responding to questions and had started breathing rapidly.  \"By this time his head was dropping forward and he was not really usefully conscious. Approximately seven miles to touchdown, I immediately donned my oxygen mask and stated that I had control. [I made] a quick assessment and decision to continue to land. P2 [Pilot 2] now fully unresponsive.\" British Airways says: \"It's not true that the first officer passed out, he was feeling unwell but neither of the pilots in the cockpit say he fainted.\" But BA does admit there was a Mayday call, signalling the highest-level of emergency, and a \"fume event\" on board. The company also points out that all passengers disembarked safely and that the incident has been referred to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch.    No-one really knows how frequently such events occur, but the BBC has seen evidence that earlier this month another BA aircraft experienced a fume event, which again seriously affected the flight's first officer. It's alleged that the same aircraft was involved in two fume events in 2019, including one in which both pilots were affected - though not incapacitated. Listen to Mike Powell's File on Four documentary, Something in the Air?, on BBC Sounds A veteran of the Air Accidents Investigation Branch estimates that fume events - of varying degrees of seriousness - happen at least twice a day worldwide. A study by the University of Kansas found that there were at least five a day in the United States alone. The cabin crew union BASSA says it happens on average once a day on BA flights. And the European Union's Aviation Safety Agency - or EASA - told the BBC there were more than 100 serious fume incidents within its remit in each of 2017 and 2018. The events vary in type.  Sometimes there's smoke - as on BA 422 to Valencia in August 2019. Passenger Gayle Fitzpatrick, who shot the footage in the video below, says BA still hasn't told her what actually happened. BA says this is because it is awaiting the results of a Spanish air accident investigation. Sometimes there's just an unpleasant smell. People describe it as \"smelly socks\", \"wet dog\", \"ozone\" or \"nail varnish\". Sometimes only the crew are affected. Sometimes it's passengers too.  The air passengers and crew breathe on board in nearly all jet airliners is \"bleed air\" taken from the flow of air entering the engine and piped into the cabin. The fear is that it can become contaminated by toxic engine oil, containing chemicals called organophosphates. The airline industry is adamant there's no evidence that fume events do lasting harm. But people who work for airlines are increasingly worried that their health is being damaged, and are recording incidents on their own unofficial fume-event registers. There is still no central database worldwide for all airlines. One worry is that if both pilots were affected by such an incident, a fume event could turn into a catastrophe. In 2016 another BA flight was flying to San Francisco when the pilots issued a PAN PAN emergency - one level down from a Mayday. The BBC has seen a confidential report from a member of the crew, in which he says there were reports of \"dizziness, headaches, nausea, itchy red eyes, metallic taste, aggression and most worryingly forgetfulness and confusion, inability to think straight and converse normally\". He goes on: \"I myself experienced a moment of forgetfulness and an inability to get words out. Twelve crew were giving us cause for concern. Eight crew were on oxygen. We would 'lose' crew who would say they were going to the loo and then they'd be found at the other end of the aircraft - with them not knowing how they got there. \"Crew were found in corners with blankets over their heads and others 'stuffing food in their mouths while on oxygen'.  Some seemed 'spaced out' and 'slow to respond'. It was discussed about crew being capable for (managing) doors for landing but we had little choice\u2026 and hoped for the best, as so many crew had been affected.\"  One of the crew on board during that PAN PAN emergency didn't want to be identified but told me that during the flight she had a euphoric type feeling, \"a giddiness\" as she puts it. \"I felt disorientated and had an acrid taste at the back of my throat - a bit like the overwhelming effect that you get when you enter a nail bar. My eyes were watering and stinging. The effects after that flight are more worrying. I am regularly out of breath and have a heavy feeling on my chest and night palpitations. I had a hacking cough which three courses of antibiotics wouldn't shift. My memory has declined. The problems with regular doctors (GPs) is that they don't have aviation medicine experience.\"  The parents of another BA crew member believe that their 34-year-old son died because of toxic air on the planes he flew in his 15-year flying career.  Charlie and Fiona Bass paid \u00a37,000 to cover the costs of a second autopsy - and further tests - on their son Matt Bass, who died in 2014. They say that those tests found organophosphates in Matt's body. At his inquest, BA denied his death was linked to cabin fumes. But Matt's local MP, Henry Smith, who represents a number of aircrew and pilots who fly out of Gatwick Airport, in his constituency of Crawley, West Sussex, told the BBC that he was concerned that there had been too many fume events, and too many resulting incidents of \"aerotoxic syndrome\" as it is sometimes called. \"I've had enough constituents come to me, one a suspected death as a result of aerotoxic syndrome and therefore I think it is incumbent on the airlines to ensure that they're not putting this aside as a minor issue but are properly investigating the health and safety of their staff and passengers,\" he said.                       Matt Bass was the inspiration for Angel Fleet - a list of those airline staff who have died, compiled by ex crew leader Dee Passon. She told me that she's shocked by how many young people appear on the list. Two of them - Karen Lysakowska and Richard Westgate - were BA pilots, both in their early 40s, when they died.  Richard Westgate's post-mortem examination showed damage to his heart and nervous system, attributed by a coroner to an unintentional sleeping pill overdose. But his family says toxic cabin air could have been the cause. In 2015, the senior coroner of Dorset, Sheriff Payne, issued what's called a \"Regulation 28 report\" about the case to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and British Airways. In it, he stated: In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. Matters of Concern are as follows\u2026 (1) That organo-phosphate compounds are present in aircraft cabin air. (2) That the occupants of aircraft cabins are exposed to organo-phosphate compounds with consequential damage to their health. (3) That impairment to the health of those controlling aircraft may lead to the death of occupants. (4) There is no real time monitoring to detect such compounds in cabin air. (5) That no account is taken of genetic variation in the human species, such as would render individuals tolerant or intolerant of the exposure. He concluded that action should be taken. Three years after that guidance, the senior coroner of Berkshire, Heidi Connor, sent a \"confidential letter of guidance\" prompted by the inquest into the death of Matt Bass, to all coroners in England and Wales. The BBC has seen that confidential letter. It says that should coroners be faced with a death involving a relatively young person who's a frequent flier, who dies in unexplained or complex circumstances, they may wish to consider the need for further post mortem tests and the retention of samples. While crew and their families blame illnesses and deaths on toxic air, there's no real way of monitoring fume events. In a search for a solution, Pall Aerospace is developing monitoring filters which EasyJet says it will trial later this year.  The Boeing 787 Dreamliner also uses a different system to provide cabin air - not the conventional bleed air system - but Dai Whittingham who's CEO of the UK Flight Safety Committee says organophosphates have been detected on the Dreamliner too.  \"The question I think becomes, 'How much is too much and is there a level of exposure at which people are being made ill?' And that's the type of research that now needs to be done,\" he says. An ex-Concorde captain, Tristan Loraine, who was medically retired after his health deteriorated has  made a film, Everybody Flies, which is going on general release in the UK next month and will be shown to congressmen and senators in the US. In it, Tristan is seen monitoring the air on board a number of planes - something that some frequent-fliers have also started doing.  Attempts are being made to develop engine oil that is less toxic. It's also possible that electric aircraft engines will start coming on stream. But one expert I spoke to said it would most likely take 20 or 30 years for such engines to become available for commercial airliners carrying hundreds of passengers.  Meanwhile the patience of flight attendants and pilots, who have long been demanding action from the airline industry, has worn thin. After years of gathering evidence, 10 lead cases against four UK airlines are due at the Royal Courts of Justice this year. Unite, the union behind the action, says it wants the public to know about the aviation industry's biggest secret. \"An extraordinary amount of powerful evidence has been gathered,\" says General Secretary Howard Beckett.         \"The simple reality for us is that our members are at risk from low-level exposure and it is a simple reality that frequent fliers will also be at risk as a result,\" he told me. The BBC asked to interview British Airways, Easyjet, Lufthansa and Ryanair. No-one was available. It was the same with aircraft manufacturers Boeing, Airbus and Bombardier. Likewise the regulators, the CAA in the UK, EASA in Europe and the FAA in America. But they do collectively argue that cabin air is always safe - and that it would be wrong to conclude that any illnesses or deaths of those who work on airliners are a result of working or travelling in an aircraft.  The CAA did issue a statement, though.   \"Our priority is always the safety of passengers and crew and we continue to work with airlines, manufacturers and international regulators to drive improvements in safety standards across the industry,\" it said. \"The overall conclusion of independent studies and evidence reviews is that there is no positive evidence of a link between exposure to contaminants in cabin air and possible acute and long-term health effects, although such a link cannot be excluded.\" The industry says that testing fume events is tricky, because they're isolated and hard to predict. They point to European tests on 61 flights which suggest that cabin air is as good as or better than at home. EASA has been trying to replicate fume events on the ground in a laboratory. British Airways also provided a statement. \"As a responsible employer, we always encourage our colleagues to tell us about any concerns, with reports passed onto the Civil Aviation Authority. Safety is our first priority and every report is thoroughly investigated, with typically 151 engineering checks before an aircraft is cleared,\" it said. \"Fume or odour events have been found to be caused by a wide range of issues, including burnt food in the oven, aerosols and e-cigarettes, and de-icing fluid. We would never operate an aircraft if we believed it posed any health or safety risk to our customers or crew.\" EasyJet says: \"EasyJet is a responsible employer and operates one of the world's most modern fleets and our aircraft are all fully compliant with the latest standards in terms of air quality and air conditioning. \"The health and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is EasyJet's highest priority.\" When I flew as air crew between 1988 and 1997, the world was a very different place. My colleagues and I had to work in cabins filled with thick clouds of cigarette smoke. Now, in another century, although cabins are tobacco-free, we've heard there could be something in the air that's for the most part unseen, but potentially very harmful. While we await the outcome of numerous court cases and the results of further research and reports, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch says it plans to publish a report on fume events later this year.  Meanwhile Dee Passon, who compiles Angel Fleet, says that her list of dead crew members is growing. And she adds: \"I know it is affecting passengers as well - but most passengers aren't making the connection. When they do, then airlines are going to be forced to do something about this.\"  Listen to Mike Powell's File on Four documentary, Something in the Air?, on BBC Sounds",

The move is to \"provide confidence\" to customers during the peak summer travel season, the airline said in a letter.  Last month, 737 Max aircraft were grounded worldwide following fatal crashes involving Ethiopian Airlines and Indonesia's Lion Air. Boeing is developing new software for the jet's anti-stall system, which has come under scrutiny since the crashes. Senior officials at American Airlines said they were \"confident\" that the Boeing upgrade would be approved by US aviation regulators before 19 August, despite its decision to ground its fleet of 24 planes until then. The cancellations will affect up to 115 flights a day, Reuters news agency reported. Last week, Southwest Airlines made a similar move and United Airlines has also cancelled 737 Max 8 flights until June. The plane is grounded as investigations continue into the Ethiopian Airlines crash last month which killed all 157 people on board. A preliminary report says the aircraft nosedived several times before it hit the ground despite pilots \"repeatedly\" following the procedures set out by Boeing. In October a 737 Max 8 flown by Indonesian airline Lion Air crashed, claiming the lives of 189 people. Investigators are focusing on the plane's anti-stall software, the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS).",

            "text": "Boeing's board of directors must face a lawsuit from shareholders over two fatal crashes involving its 737 Max plane, a US judge has ruled.  Morgan Zurn said the first crash was a \"red flag\" about a key safety system on the aircraft \"that the board should have heeded but instead ignored\". She said the real victims were the dead and their families but investors had also lost billions of dollars. Boeing said it would \"consider next steps\". In her ruling the Delaware judge said: \"While it may seem callous in the face of [the families'] losses, corporate law recognizes another set of victims: Boeing as an enterprise, and its stockholders.  \"Stockholders have come to this court claiming Boeing's directors and officers failed them in overseeing mission-critical airplane safety to protect enterprise and stockholder value.\"  The crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019 killed all 346 people on board, leading to the 737 Max being grounded around the world.  Investigations later found a flaw in an automated flight control system, known as MCAS, was at fault.  In January, Boeing paid $2.5bn to settle criminal charges it concealed information about changes to MCAS from safety officials, contributing to the crashes.  But it still faces civil lawsuits from families along with the latest action from shareholders.  On Tuesday, Vice Chancellor Zurn dismissed some of the investors' claims, including one regarding a decision to award former chief executive Dennis Muilenburg a $60m retirement package after he was fired.  However, the judge said another claim about board member oversight could go ahead. Shares in the plane maker slumped following the accidents and are yet to fully recover. A Boeing spokesperson said: \"We are disappointed in the court's decision to allow the plaintiffs' case to proceed past this preliminary stage of litigation. \"We will review the opinion closely over the coming days as we consider next steps.\" The Max was cleared to fly in the US in November 2020, and in Europe and Canada in January this year. It remains grounded in China.  The crashes have already cost Boeing about $20bn in fines, cancelled orders and other costs. ",

            "title": "Ryanair expects to win in airline 'fare wars'",
            "text": "Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary has said he expects the airline to benefit from any price war in the industry. Mr O'Leary said \"artificially low prices\" and \"attritional fare wars\" could dent profits for a year or two. He was speaking after the airline reported that profits fell by nearly a third last year to \u20ac1bn (\u00a3880m) because fuel costs rose and fares fell.  Profits at Europe's biggest discount airline might also be lower this year, as fares could fall by up to 2%. For last year, Ryanair's average one-way fare was \u20ac37, down 6%, although this was offset by spending on services such as hotels and car hire. For the current financial year, the carrier said it was \"cautious\" on pricing and had \"zero\" visibility for the second half of the year. It said that while bookings in the first half of this year were slightly ahead of last year, \"fares are lower and we expect this trend will continue through 2019\". Mr O'Leary said: \"Frankly, if we are in a period where there's going to be attritional fare wars for a year or two that's good for Ryanair... as... we have the lowest cost base... profits will suffer for a year or two and I think that is what our shareholders should expect. \"However it is clear in my mind that within the next four to five years you are seeing the emergence of four or five large European airline groups,\" he said. He referred to Ryanair, Lufthansa, IAG (owner of British Airways), Air France-KLM and, probably, Easyjet. Mergers of other airlines would lead to \"some upward pressure on pricing,\" he said. \"[Fares] will begin to rise again because they are artificially low at the moment,\" Mr O'Leary said. Despite a 7% increase in passenger numbers, earlier this year Ryanair was named the UK's least-liked short-haul airline for the sixth year running in a survey by consumer body Which?. Neil Sorahan, Ryanair's chief financial officer, told the BBC that the airline did not spend too much time worrying about surveys and that the most important thing was being on time. \"Our customers enjoyed an average fare of \u20ac37 which was down 6% on last year. At the same time, however, they continue to spend money on our ancillary products [car hire etc] which helps offset that,\" he said. Mr Sorahan said there was too much capacity in the market, and pointed to a wave of airline failures - such as Primera, Flybmi and WOW - caused by higher oil prices and lower fares. Last week, EasyJet reported a loss of \u00a3275m in the six months to the end of March, compared with a \u00a368m loss a year earlier, while troubled travel operator Thomas Cook is attempting to sell its airline to plug a gap in financing after reported a \u00a31.5bn half-year loss. Fuel prices are also an important factor to airline profitability and Ryanair said its bill for this year is expected to rise by \u20ac460m. The airline said its forecasts will also depend on last-minute fares and any impact from Brexit, but it estimated that profits could range between \u20ac750m and \u20ac950m. Ryanair is delaying deliveries of five of the Boeing 737 Max planes, which have been grounded because of two fatal crashes, but said it had the \"utmost confidence\" in the aircraft. The delay to deliveries from the spring will lead it to cut capacity by one million passengers this year, but it ultimately expects the planes to drive down costs and, Ryanair said, lead to lower prices for passengers. The airline expect the 737 Max planes to return to the air in July or August in the US, and September or October in the EU. Ryanair also announced it was buying back \u20ac700m of its shares, which analysts at Liberum said would support the share price in the short-term despite the \"disappointing\" guidance on profits for this year. \"Ryanair remains the long-term winner in the European airline industry, based on its leading market position, extensive network, low unit costs and strong balance sheet,\" Liberum said. \"We see tougher market conditions in the short term as positive for the stronger airlines in the long term, since this clears out weaker competitors and aids consolidation in the market.\" Shares in Ryanair fell 6% in early trading, before recovering to stand 1% lower. Ryanair's profit figure excludes the loss of \u20ac139m from the Austrian airline Lauda it took over last year. ",

            "text": "A pilot was forced to take an unplanned turn to avoid a \"high-risk\" drone crash, a near-miss report has revealed. The Airbus A320, which was carrying up to 186 passengers, was approaching Gatwick Airport when the drone was spotted, the UK Airprox Board said. The plane was flying at 1,700ft (520m) - drones are not permitted above 400ft. The aircraft was level with the drone but the pilot turned to the right by up to eight degrees, putting a distance of 80-100ft between them horizontally. The UK Airprox Board (UKAB) said as well as the dark-coloured drone being flown above the maximum permitted height, it was also within controlled airspace. It concluded the near-miss on 28 April was category A, the highest risk. The airline involved was not identified in the report, but EasyJet and British Airways are among the carriers operating that aircraft to and from Gatwick. Drone no-fly zone near airports extended Drones ground flights at Gatwick Three other category A drone incidents were highlighted in the UKAB's latest monthly meeting report. On 6 June a yellow and orange quadcopter passed down the side of a Boeing 747 approaching Heathrow. On 25 May a \"metallic looking\" drone passed \"very close\" to the right wing of an Airbus A319 at 6,500ft. On 2 June a black drone a metre wide came within a few metres of the right wing of a Cessna 152 light aircraft, flying above Chelmsford, Essex. There were 125 near-misses with drones reported in 2018, up from 93 in 2017. There were six recorded in 2014. The Civil Aviation Authority's Dronecode sets out rules for drone users, including staying below 400ft and flying at least 50m (164ft) away from buildings and people. Drone sightings at Gatwick in December caused about 1,000 flights to be cancelled or diverted over 36 hours, affecting more than 140,000 passengers. Heathrow, Leeds Bradford and Dublin airports have also been forced to suspend flights due to drone activity this year.",

            "title": "The evolution of UK-Australia travel into a single flight",
            "text": "Qantas will begin the first non-stop flights between Australia and the United Kingdom on Saturday. The 17-hour trip is a departure from an era when glamorous perceptions masked the tedium of a days-long journey. Now, as Julian Lorkin reports from Sydney, much focus is on the body clock. In less than a century, travelling from Australia to the UK has evolved from a six-week sea voyage to just a single flight taking 17 hours. There will be no stopovers on 24 March, when Flight QF9 leaves from Perth, Western Australia's capital, at 18:45 local time for London. It returns as QF10 on 25 March, leaving Heathrow at 13.30 local time and arriving the next day. The 14,498km (9,000 miles) service will be the first non-stop link between the nations. The first trip on the so-called \"Kangaroo Route\" started in 1935. That journey had 10 major stopovers and 21 more refuelling stops over a distance of 20,525km (12,700 miles). The co-pilot of the tiny De Havilland 86 handed out sandwiches, and the fare cost the equivalent of around A$18,000 (\u00a310,000; $14,000) today. By 1938, \"flying boats\" flew from Sydney for Southampton - a trip that lasted nine days. Cabins were so spacious that passengers could stroll around and smoke. Over the decades stopovers reduced, but the first flights that modern travellers would recognise started in 1971. With two stopovers, Qantas Boeing 747 passengers were advised to bring \"several books\". The \"Captain Cook Lounge\" bar behind the cockpit provided the only other entertainment, the airline said. The route uses the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, which is twice as fuel efficient as the Boeing 747. It also improves cabin air pressure. \"Non-stop flights have been talked about for many years, but aircraft technology has only just caught up,\" said Dr Dean Wilkie, a consumer marketing expert from the University of Adelaide. The flight will be the world's second-longest after Qatar Airways' route from Doha to Auckland, which spans 14,529km, according to the International Air Transport Association. Other carriers, including Emirates and United Airlines, have also flown non-stop journeys greater than 14,000km. As technology advances make ultra-long flights more economically viable, other challengers are expected. Singapore Airlines plans to claim back the coveted longest-flight trophy, with a 15,300km journey between Singapore and New York. It once flew that route using Airbus A340-500s, but stopped in 2013 because the four-engine plane was inefficient.  Airbus is refining the A350, and its latest model will have a range of about 17,960km. That puts the prospect of an even longer route - such as Sydney to London - within reach. The Western Australia (WA) state government is expecting an increase in tourist numbers after an advertising blitz in London that calls on people to \"wake up in Western Australia\". The state has entered into a A$5.7m (\u00a33.2m GBP) marketing agreement with Qantas, including screens showing the highlights of WA at London's Liverpool Street station. According to state Tourism Minister Paul Papalia, \"the campaign encourages travel into regional WA, as well as [local attractions] Rottnest Island, Elizabeth Quay and Perth's beaches\". Qantas potentially has an untapped market, according to Dr Wilkie. \"The UK is a standout market for Qantas, but many tourists never consider Western Australia. Now they'll get to see Perth too,\" he told the BBC. Melbourne will also benefit from a connecting flight. Fierce competition from Asia-based airlines should also put pressure on fares, Dr Wilkie said. Singapore Airlines abandoned its previous flight to New York after deciding that 19 hours was too much to tolerate in economy. A move to convert the entire aircraft into business class was not financially sustainable. Now experts are looking at ways to minimise the toll that long-haul flights can have on passengers in economy. Prof Steve Simpson, from the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre, works with Qantas to study the impact  of such a long flight on the human body. He describes it a test of human endurance. \"Your circadian rhythm takes cues off food and light, and this flight disrupts it,\" he said. He said that's why flight attendants typically lower window shades and serve meals at destination times - a move that often surprises passengers. Twenty people on the inaugural UK-Australia flight will be wired into monitors to check how their bodies are coping, including their temperature, which is crucial for sleeping. \"It will be 22C (72F) when people board, but 4C lower mid-flight, which tricks the body to change their internal clock,\" he said. Passengers can also use strategies to help themselves, he added. \"Get up really early a few days before the flight. Have an early lunch at [the airport], maybe at 10am,\" he said. \"The first meal on the plane becomes dinner. You'll sleep, even though it's only 4pm.\"",

            "text": "China will pass the US as the biggest air travel market within 10-15 years, driving a big rise in aircraft sales, the world's largest jet maker says.  Boeing's latest global industry report predicts airlines will need 42,700 aircraft over the next 20 years, up 3% on last year's forecast. Boeing valued the sales at $6.3 trillion (\u00a34.8tn) at today's prices The closely-watched report was unveiled on day two of the Farnborough Airshow, where more orders were announced. Despite trade tensions, rising oil prices, and hikes in interest rates, the Boeing forecast suggests no end to the near-decade long boom in aircraft sales. The production lines at Boeing and its European rival Airbus are already booked up for years ahead. On Tuesday, Russian airline Volga Dnepr committed to buying Boeing freight aircraft worth $11.8bn at list prices, while Airbus announced a provisional deal with an unnamed customer for 100 of its A320 jets. And US aircraft leasing company Air Lease Corp announced a commitment to order as many as 78 Boeing single-aisle and wide-body airplanes in a deal valued at $9.6bn at catalogue prices.  Boeing's upbeat sales forecast underlined the importance of China to the aircraft industry. One in four of Boeing's passenger aircraft went to Chinese customers last year. The company's commercial marketing chief, Randy Tinseth, told a press conference at Farnborough that he expected China to overtake the US as the world's largest domestic air travel market within 10-15 years. Also, he said, demand for cargo aircraft would also increase on the back of e-commerce, with Chinese traders and consumers accounting for the biggest single rise. However, Mr Tinseth declined to comment on whether Boeing's growth in China could be hindered by a trade war. \"We are going to focus on what we can control,\" he said. The company's sales forecast for the next two decades predicts a 5% rise to 31,360 in demand for single-aisle aircraft, such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families, which are popular with low-cost airlines. Sales in the larger, wide-bodied bracket were expected to fall by just 140 to 8,070 aircraft over the next 20 years, but only because longer-range single-aisle jets were eating into the market, Mr Tinseth said. Boeing trimmed its forecast for the regional jet fleet to 2,320 deliveries. Competition in this sector is expected to intensify, as Airbus has taken over Bombardier's C-Series aircraft programme and Boeing is buying Embraer. ",

            "title": "Boeing 737 crash: Coroner rules Britons unlawfully killed",
            "text": "Three British people who died in a plane crash were unlawfully killed, a coroner has ruled. Sam Pegram, Oliver Vick and Joanna Toole were among 157 people who died aboard a Boeing 737 Max airliner in Ethiopia in 2019. Lawyers for the families had sought a verdict of unlawful killing ahead of an inquest into their loved ones deaths. The court heard flight ET302 from Addis Ababa to Kenya crashed shortly after take-off because of a design flaw. A sensor failure meant that flight control software, known as MCAS, deployed at the wrong time and pushed the aircraft into a catastrophic dive. Despite the pilots' efforts to regain control of the plane, it crashed in remote farmland outside the Ethiopian capital.  West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield said the incident occurred as a result of a series of failures relating to the development and operation of MCAS.  The flight control software was designed to make the plane easier and more predictable to fly under very specific circumstances. This would avoid the need for pilots used to the previous generation of 737 to undergo expensive retraining, something which would otherwise have made the plane less attractive to airlines. Two employees of the manufacturer, the coroner said, had deliberately deceived regulators and operators of the 737 Max over the operation of a safety critical system.  The inquest heard Mr Pegram's parents describe the 25-year-old humanitarian worker as a kind, compassionate man with an infectious sense of humour. \"He had a passion for human rights, but also had the drive and inner strength to make a difference,\" his father Mark said. Ms Toole's father explained how his 36-year-old daughter, a sustainability campaigner, had \"the rare combination of empathy for animals and people\".  The death of a child, he said was \"like losing a part of yourself,\" he added. Mr Vick, a humanitarian worker from Berkshire, was described by his mother Cheryl as a devoted father to his daughters, who had an \"unwavering focus on making the world a better place for as many people as possible\". Abdulqadir Qasim, a former Somali refugee, who arrived in the UK aged 25 had been on his way to Kenya to have a meeting about a new job when he died in the crash. There was no inquest into his death, but in a video statement in court on Monday, his wife Qamar described how he had been a \"wonderful husband and father\". His youngest son, she said, had been a toddler at the time of the crash and could not remember his dad. Prior to the Ethiopia crash, an identical failure caused another Boeing 737 Max to crash into the sea off Indonesia, killing 189 people. The 737 Max was eventually grounded for 20 months after the two crashes. The company has admitted responsibility for the loss of the Ethiopian flight, but in an agreement with the US government it gained immunity from prosecution in exchange for $2.5bn (\u00a31.9bn) in fines and compensation.",

            "text": "The past year saw one of the great US companies, Boeing, suffer a hammer blow to its reputation after one of its newest models, the 737 Max, crashed for the second time.   The loss in March of an Ethiopian Airlines plane cost the lives of all 157 people on board.    The disaster turned out not to have been caused by terrorism or a catastrophic mechanical failure, but because the pilots couldn't control a piece of software.  The software was a system called MCAS, which had already been identified as a key factor in in the crash of a Lion Air Boeing 737 Max in Indonesia the previous October, which killed 189 passengers and crew.  Reflecting on both crashes, Capt Dennis Tajer, one of American Airlines most experienced pilots with 27 years' experience, told me that with this particular Boeing 737 Max plane: \"We were in a safety culture system that was broken.\"  Capt Tajer, a former air force pilot who is the spokesman for the pilots' union at American Airlines, says he was \"outraged\" that Boeing and the regulators had initially decided not to tell pilots about the MCAS system.  This was \"a very clear violation of the trust and the flow of information to pilots\", he says.  Aircraft stay in the sky because the shape of the wings means the pressure above the wing is less than the pressure underneath it. But they can fall out of the sky if a \"stall\" happens when turbulence upsets the pressure difference. This is particularly likely when the nose is pointing upwards at a high angle relative to the airflow - a high \"angle of attack\". Boeing found that when the 737 Max was flying at a high angle of attack - and close to a stall - the controls felt light and unfamiliar to pilots used to older versions of the 737 Max.  MCAS was designed to remedy this problem by automatically trimming the plane so that the nose would want to move downwards. In theory this made the handling feel more predictable.  But in the two accidents, MCAS was activated at the wrong time and ended up forcing the nose down repeatedly - until the pilots lost control and a crash became inevitable.  Speaking for 15,000 pilots at American Airlines and referring to Boeing's initial secrecy, Captain Tajer says: \"No one would believe it if it had been written in a fictional form but it is actually happening right before our eyes.\"  Regulators grounded the 737 Max after the second crash, causing huge problems for Boeing as the aircraft represents about half of its commercial plane sales. Airlines had to cut services when they were unable to use the plane.   MCAS which is short for Manoeuvring Characteristic Augmentation System is now being rewritten but Captain Tajer says his pilots won't be flying them again until a comprehensive programme of pilot training is completed. Boeing's chief executive Dennis Muilenburg was forced out of the company on Monday. Boeing earlier announced a permanent safety committee to oversee development, manufacturing and operation of its aircraft and services.  The US-China trade dispute ground on through 2019, with partial resolutions giving way to new tariffs then new de-escalations.  The ill-will between the two countries was sharpened by the US decision to target the Chinese technology giant Huawei.    Huawei is a world leader in systems that send out signals to mobile phones; in particular, fifth generation or 5G networks.  But the US has banned the use of Huawei's equipment in America and encouraged its allies to do the same.  The US also stopped Huawei using systems developed by American companies including Google's Android operating system that was formerly installed on Huawei's mobile phones.  The Trump administration believes that China's technological advances have been built upon stolen intellectual property and heavy government subsidies.   Washington also believes Huawei is ultimately controlled by the Chinese government and that therefore there is a security risk if its technology is embedded in the latest US communications infrastructure.   Huawei says no evidence exists that the firm poses any threat to national security.   Meanwhile its chief financial office, Meng Wanzhou who is the daughter of the firm's founder, was arrested more than a year ago and remains on bail in Canada fighting extradition to the US on charges of violating sanctions against Iran.  The big news for Britain in 2019 was the confirmation that the country really is leaving the European Union. Voters made that choice in a referendum in 2016.  But in the past three years politicians argued continually about whether the country should re-run the vote or decide to nominally leave the EU but continue to apply its rules and regulations.  The victory of Boris Johnson's Conservative Party finally settled the principle of what happens. The managing director of Capital Economics forecasting group in London, Roger Bootle, told me he was \"delighted and relieved\" at the election result: \"I think there would have been huge risks to staying in the EU.\" He argues that over recent decades the EU has been a zone of relative economic failure.  \"All this is only going to get worse, we would have been in a very vulnerable position.\" By contrast, the trade specialist, Rebecca Harding who is chief executive of Coriolis Technologies, says she is disappointed by the result as she wanted Britain to stay in the EU. \"A lot of our trade is woven into European supply chains. The issue now is that we need to extricate ourselves from the EU's rules and regulations in a way that does the least damage to the British economy,\" says Ms Harding. Ms Harding says the talks to agree tariff-free trade won't be easy. The full half-hour radio version of this review can be heard on BBC World Service at 15:30 GMT on Christmas Day. The podcast version is already available.",

            "text": "Aviation officials are investigating a near-collision between a FedEx cargo plane and a Southwest passenger flight at a Texas airport on Saturday. The cargo plane had to abort its landing as the Southwest flight was cleared to depart on the same runway, officials said. A voice reportedly from an air traffic control recording is heard warning: \"Southwest abort. FedEx is on the go.\" The planes were under 1,000ft (304m) apart, a flight-tracking service said. The FedEx jet - a Boeing 767 cargo plane - had been cleared to land at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport at 06:40 local time (11:40 GMT) on Saturday morning, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). But an air traffic controller cleared Southwest Flight 708 for departure from the same runway with the FedEx crew about three miles away, flight data interpreted by FlightRadar24 shows. The FedEx plane at one point reported an altitude of 75ft before climbing as it caught up to the Southwest plane, which remained on the runway. An animated video released by FlightRadar24 shows the cargo plane approaching and passing directly over the commercial flight before making a sharp turn away from the runway. \"The pilot of the FedEx airplane discontinued the landing and initiated a climb out,\" the FAA said in a statement. \"The Southwest flight departed safely.\" Both planes completed their journeys without further incident, with the FedEx flight circling the airfield and landing safely 12 minutes later, while the Southwest flight travelled to Cancun, Mexico. Investigators with the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are probing the incident. It comes less than a month after a similar close call between an American Airlines and Delta Airlines plane in New York.",

            "text": "US air safety officials say they will investigate why a Boeing 777 jet unexpectedly lost altitude and nearly plunged into the Pacific Ocean. United Airlines flight 1722 had left Maui on 18 December and was climbing when it suddenly plummeted 1,400ft (425m), reports say. It stabilised at just 775ft in altitude and went on to land safely in San Francisco 27 minutes early. Its adds to a number of near misses involving planes this year.  The flight was going normally until 71 seconds after take-off from Kahului Airport when it suddenly dropped in elevation, according to Flightradar24, an aviation website. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which investigates US plane crashes, will produce a report about the incident within three weeks. Passenger Rod Williams told CNN: \"There were a number of screams on the plane. Everybody knew that something was out of the ordinary, or at least that this was not normal.\" He said it was \"sobering\" to think they were probably about five seconds away from hitting the water. The flight's pilots filed an internal safety report after landing, a United Airlines representative told BBC News. They have a combined 25,000 hours of flying experience. An investigation by the airline resulted in additional training for the pilots, which United said was ongoing. \"Safety remains our highest priority,\" a company official said in a statement. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also received a report of the incident, the federal agency says, and \"took appropriate action\". It did not elaborate. The incident is among a number of potentially dangerous events reported by US airlines recently, including two near misses in New York and Texas this year. The NTSB is already looking into two close calls within the last month. On 4 February, a FedEx cargo plane aborted its landing to avoid a Southwest Airlines plane at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas. At John F Kennedy Airport in New York in January, a Delta flight stopped short on the runway during take-off to avoid an American Airlines plane.",

            "title": "British Airways: A breakdown in trust?",
            "text": "British Airways was once seen as a national champion, a potent symbol of the country's commercial prowess and - as the airline itself puts it - of \"timeless British values and modern Britain's strengths\".  Now, however, it is a company in crisis - struggling to cope with the huge financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic, its relationship with the government apparently fractured, and in conflict with its own employees.  There's no question that BA, like other airlines, has been dramatically affected by the lockdowns and closure of borders associated with the pandemic. For weeks, it has been operating just a handful of flights a day, while the bulk of its fleet has been parked up.  But it is BA's response to the crisis which has created an atmosphere within the company that staff have described as toxic, and prompted a political backlash.  In late April, its parent company International Airlines Group announced plans to implement a major restructuring programme at BA, which could lead to up to 12,000 redundancies. It said it would begin formal consultations with its unions, Unite, GMB and Balpa.  Launching that process, BA said it wanted to reach agreement over the proposals - which would also include significant changes to the terms and conditions of remaining staff. But it warned that if an agreement could not be reached, it would force the issue - by giving them notice, and offering them new contracts. In a letter to the prime minister on 27 May, the chief executive of parent company IAG, Willie Walsh, wrote: \"We are open to any ideas on how to limit and mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on our business and our employees. \"Regrettably, Unite and GMB have decided not to represent their members, preferring to engage in what Unite calls 'crisis leverage' in an effort to intimidate BA and delay any consultation taking place at this critical time. This has not and most definitely, will not work. Time is not on our side so we will not pause or defer our consultations.\" But the apparent ultimatum from BA has triggered a deep rift with the unions. Unite and GMB are currently refusing to take part in formal consultations. Balpa has been engaging with the company, but now says the negotiations are \"hanging by a thread\".  For cabin crew, there is not only the threat of redundancy, but also the possibility of big pay cuts for long-serving staff - in some cases of more than 50%. Many of those affected believe the company is using the current crisis to force through changes it has wanted to make for years.  Longer-serving crew at BA have contracts which are, by modern standards, relatively generous. They date back to an era when the airline industry was less ferociously competitive, before the emergence of budget carriers such as Ryanair and Easyjet forced older airlines to cut costs and change their business models. In 2010, BA engaged in a bitter dispute with Unite over plans to overhaul cabin crew contracts. The row lasted two years and involved 22 days of strikes. Ultimately a settlement was reached, under which existing staff retained most of their privileges - but new joiners were put on inferior contracts, with lower pay.  Now, Unite says BA is using the Covid-19 crisis as cover to make \"permanent, drastic cuts to jobs, wages and conditions\", at a time when industrial action is not an option. The union is waging a high-profile campaign against what it calls the company's \"betrayal\" of its staff.  The campaign has garnered some high-profile political support. One of BA's fiercest critics is the Conservative MP and chair of the transport select committee, Huw Merriman.  He says the way in which staff at the company have been treated is \"appalling\". \"It's the equivalent of holding a gun to someone's head,\" he says. \"It's really sad to see an iconic brand being dragged into the gutter by its management\".  When the redundancy plans were first announced, Balpa came to the negotiating table. Initially, the company did not threaten to \"fire and rehire\" pilots if they failed to accept new terms. But at the end of last week, that changed - and pilots were given the same ultimatum other employees were already facing.  According to Brian Strutton, general secretary of Balpa, that move \"felt like a kick in the teeth to those people who had been carrying out negotiations in good faith\". The union is still talking to BA - but he says the negotiations are \"hanging by a thread\" and could break down at any time.  Meanwhile many pilots have responded furiously. One BA captain told the BBC, \"I wouldn't say there was a lot of trust beforehand. There's even less now\". Another described the mood within the company as \"terrible\".  \"I'm absolutely amazed at the huge outpouring of anger among our members\", says Mr Strutton. \"There's outrage and despair at the way management are running the company they once loved working for\".  A number of pilots have also voiced concerns that the row could have an impact on safety - with worries about their jobs and mortgages providing an unwelcome distraction for pilots on the flight deck, and potentially affecting their mental health.  All of this has left BA looking like a company under siege. A great deal of anger also seems to be aimed at Willie Walsh, widely seen as the architect of the planned cuts.  The airline itself insists that the industry is \"facing the deepest structural change in its history\". It says it is acting now to protect as many jobs as possible - and that it wants to work with the trade unions to mitigate the impact of any changes. Although BA does have substantial cash reserves, it is currently burning through \u00a320m every day - and with the majority of its fleet grounded, there is very little money coming in.  It is also feuding with the government over the introduction of a 14-day quarantine period for travellers coming into the UK - which Mr Walsh says has \"torpedoed\" the possibility of resuming flights in July.  Few within the industry expect a quick recovery. According to the International Air Transport Association, air traffic is unlikely to return to the levels seen last year until 2023. Around the world, carriers are cutting back - and BA's direct rivals such as Easyjet, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic are all planning thousands of redundancies.  But what marks BA out is the response to its actions - and the palpable resentment now directed at a brand that once invoked national pride.",

Flight EP3704 left Tehran at 04:30 GMT, and crashed about an hour later. The aircraft, a twin-engine turboprop, came down on Dena Mountain, 22km (14 miles) from Yasuj, news channel Irinn reported.  Sixty passengers, two security guards, two flight attendants and the pilot and co-pilot were on board. The airline initially said everyone had been killed, but said later: \"Given the special circumstances of the region, we still have no access to the spot of the crash and therefore we cannot accurately and definitely confirm the death of all passengers of this plane.\" Bad weather, including fog and heavy snow, has hampered rescue efforts. Emergency teams have had to travel to the crash site by land rather than using a helicopter. Passengers' relatives have gathered at a mosque near Tehran's Mehrabad airport, according to Reuters news agency.  \"I can't bring myself to believe it,\" said one woman whose husband was on board. One man told Tabnak news website that he had missed the flight.  Showing an unused ticket as proof, he said: \"God has been really kind to me but I am so sad from the bottom of my heart for all those dear ones who lost their lives.\" Iran's President Hassan Rouhani expressed sympathy for all involved, saying, in a statement, that the incident brought \"great grief and sorrow\". Iran has suffered several aviation accidents in recent years and has an ageing aircraft fleet.  The country has struggled to obtain spare parts to maintain its planes in the face of international sanctions imposed to curb its nuclear programme. Those sanctions have been mostly lifted under a 2015 deal between Iran and the US alongside several other powers.   Aseman, Iran's third largest airline, signed a contract with Boeing last year to buy 30 of its latest medium-range 737s.  The crashed plane, a French-Italian-made ATR 72-500, was 25 years old, Iran's civil aviation organisation said. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has also expressed \"deep sympathy\" for relatives of those on board, saying the accident \"saddened the hearts\".

Vale of Glamorgan MP, Alun Cairns, called the route a \"vital\" connection to the Middle East. Qatar Airways, which flies to more than 160 destinations worldwide, withdrew the Cardiff to Doha service after a dispute with Airbus that left them short of aircraft. \"The pandemic clearly had an impact on the airline industry, but I am hopeful that with the return of Qatar Airways to Cardiff will provide a big boost to the airport that has suffered in recent times,\" said Mr Cairns. The news comes after budget airline Wizz Air announced in January it would end all flights in and out of Cardiff Airport. Figures showed Cardiff Airport was the hardest hit by the Covid pandemic in the UK in 2020, seeing passenger numbers plummet by 87%. The Welsh government said: \"We would welcome the resumption of the Doha service from Cardiff.\"",

            "text": "Politicians and unions in the UK have reacted with surprise and relief after the Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier won a major trade case in the US. It had been anticipated that the manufacturer would fail in its bid to overturn a ruling to impose big tariffs on US imports of its C-Series jet. It was thought such an outcome could threaten thousands of jobs in the UK, many of which are based in Belfast. But the case, centred on a complaint by aerospace rival Boeing, was dismissed. The ruling, by the US International Trade Commission (ITC), means that a tax of almost 300% will not now be imposed on orders of C-Series planes by American carriers. \"I welcome this decision, which is good news for British industry. \"Bombardier and its innovative workforce play a vital role in the Northern Ireland economy.\" \"The UK government has been working tirelessly to safeguard Bombardier jobs and argued from the very start this case was wholly unjustified. \"It is great that the company will continue to play a hugely important role in our economy as we build a Northern Ireland fit for the future.\" \"The decision by the International Trade Commission confirms what the UK and Canadian Governments working hand-in-hand has maintained from the outset, that this case is unjustified. \"We are pleased that the ITC have now recognised this.\" \"This is fantastic news for Bombardier and particularly for the firm's 4,000 workers in Northern Ireland and the many more who form part of the supply chain here. \"This news means that the C-Series is fully ready for take-off and I firmly believe it can now maximise its huge potential.\" \"[This] represents a welcome victory for Bombardier, the Belfast workforce and their representatives at Unite the Union. \"I hope that the matter is now closed and that the company can secure the future of the C-Series, and by extension the workforce in their new partnership with Airbus.\" \"I hope it is the end of the matter, which has been highly disruptive to Bombardier and extremely stressful for local employees of the company and those working in the supply chain. \"We need to ensure the organisation can now proceed with the construction and supply of one of the most innovative aircraft on the global market.\" \"I welcome the common sense approach from the ITC in rejecting the protectionist complaint brought by Boeing.  \"This ruling is testament to the unwavering campaign by all involved in exposing the complaint from Boeing for what it really was - a bid to silence a competitor.\" \"Workers at Bombardier will be delighted tonight - they and the company are wholly vindicated by the ITC decision. \"They will know that their unions - especially Steve Turner and all at Unite - worked incredibly hard to win this.\" \"It is a right and just decision, which is in no small part down to the tireless campaign by Unite members - when the going got tough Unite did not throw the towel in. \"The C-Series is a world-beating aircraft made by world-class workers. There can be no backsliding from the US government on this decision.\" \"This is great news for thousands of Bombardier workers, as well as workers in their supply chain. \"But we must not be complacent - the Trump administration has shown it wants to shut down Britain's ability to support good jobs in strategic industries.\" \"These tariffs would have been nothing short of a disaster for the Northern Ireland economy. \"This whole saga must act as a warning to the UK government about the battles it faces to defend jobs and industries as we leave the EU and face the increasingly hostile territory of trade wars on our own.\"",

            "text": "India's national carrier, Air India, has blamed the weather for a bed bug infestation on one of its recent flights from New York to the western city of Mumbai. Photos of a few business class passengers bitten by bed bugs were widely shared online in the past week. Air India has since apologised and ordered an inquiry. It also promised to \"rigorously fumigate\" the plane.  India's biggest international carrier, the airline is in severe debt.  Adding to its woes, the company has lost market share to new entrants and suffers a bad reputation of having poor service and cancelling flights. A few years ago, an Air India plane travelling from Mumbai to London was forced to turn back mid-flight after a rat was spotted on board.  Ayeshea Perera, BBC News Delhi Air India is often in the news for all the wrong reasons. From rats on flights to clogged toilets to inefficient flight crews, the constantly negative headlines have often led to newspapers declaring the airline a \"national shame\". However the truth is slightly more nuanced than that. Of course Air India has had a completely avoidable series of mishaps that have been embarrassing to say the least. However it also boasts one of the most modern fleets in the world, some of the best pilots in the industry, and there have certainly never been any incidents that involve crew members seriously injuring passengers. In India the overwhelming feeling towards the airline is one of weary affection. Incidents like this are often treated as par for the course, and do not generate scandal in the way you would expect. Besides, that is, one recent incident that had everyone up in arms - the decision to only serve vegetarian food on domestic flights. Air India apologised one week after passengers who had flown from New York to Mumbai on 17 July complained of being bitten by bed bugs.   Some shared photos in which their arms appeared to be covered in bug bites. Others shared close-up images of their seats, alleging they were infested with bed bugs.  One of India's oldest airlines, Air India has not turned a profit since 2007.   In June 2017, India's cabinet approved plans to privatise the carrier. But it failed to attract buyers after the federal government offered to sell a controlling stake.   Any buyer would have to take on about $5bn (\u00a33.6bn) of debt, which is only about half of what the airline owes.",

            "title": "Ukraine rejects Iran's final report on downing of flight PS752",
            "text": "Ukraine has rejected the Civil Aviation Organisation of Iran's final report on the downing of a Ukrainian jet as a \"cynical attempt\" to conceal the truth. Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 was hit by two missiles after taking off from Tehran on 8 January 2020. All 176 people on board died. The CAOI's report blames errors by an air defence unit for the tragedy. It says an operator \"misidentified\" the plane as hostile and fired the missiles without authorisation from a commander. In a video posted on Facebook following the report's publication, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called the Iranian investigation \"biased\", the evidence presented \"selective\", and the conclusions \"deceptive\". \"The document does not present all the circumstances, does not reveal the root causes of the tragedy or the chain of actions that led to it. This is not a report, it is a collection of manipulations, the goal of which is not to establish the truth, but to whitewash the Islamic Republic of Iran,\" he said. Ukraine and four other countries whose citizens or residents were killed - Canada, the UK, Afghanistan and Sweden - have demanded Iran provide a complete and thorough explanation of what happened. For the first three days after flight PS752 crashed, Iran's armed forces denied any responsibility and the CAOI suggested there had been a technical failure. Authorities also allowed the crash site to be looted and then bulldozed. But as evidence mounted, the Revolutionary Guards' Aerospace Force said an air defence unit had mistaken the Boeing 737-800 for a US missile. Iran's air defences had been on high alert at the time because the country had just fired ballistic missiles at two Iraqi military bases hosting US forces in retaliation for the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike in Baghdad five days earlier. The CAOI's final report says that, following a tactical relocation, the air defence unit in question \"failed to adjust the system direction out of human error, causing the operator to observe the target flying west from [Tehran Imam Khomeini Airport] as a target approaching Tehran from the south-west at a relatively low altitude\". \"The target specifications were announced to the command centre, but the message was never relayed. Without receiving a go-ahead or response from the command centre, [the operator] came to identify the target as a hostile one and fired a missile at the aircraft against the procedure planned,\" it added. According to the report, the warhead of the first surface-to-air missile detonated near the plane and \"caused damage to the aircraft systems, after which the cascading damage was observable\".  The three cockpit crew members \"appeared to have sustained no physical injuries in the blast and were just involved in managing the situation\", it adds.  The report says it is likely that the second missile \"did not affect the aircraft\", and that it \"had maintained its structural integrity by the time it crashed into the ground and exploded\" in the Shahedshahr area, south-west of Tehran. The CAOI concludes that \"neither the aircraft technical or operational condition, nor its flight path and altitude contributed to the misidentification\" by the air defence unit. Nine Ukraine crew members were killed, along with 167 passengers.  According to Iranian officials, the victims included 146 people travelling on Iranian passports.  Canada says 55 of the victims were Canadian citizens and 30 were permanent residents, while 53 others were travelling to Canada via Kyiv that day. In a joint statement on Wednesday, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau and Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said they remained \"deeply concerned about the lack of convincing information and evidence\". \"Their families deserve answers to important questions, including on the series of events that led to these missiles being launched in the first place, and why the airspace was allowed to remain open during a period of heightened hostilities,\" they said. Canada is due to release the results of its own investigation into the crash \"soon\", the statement added. In December, the then Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said he did not believe the downing of flight PS752 could be blamed on human error.   UN special rapporteur Agn\u00e8s Callamard said in a separate report that while she had found no concrete evidence that the targeting of flight PS752 was intentional, the explanations provided by the Iranian authorities \"present many inconsistencies\" and \"do not add up\".

            "title": "Dubai Airshow: Airbus seals order with US firm Indigo",
            "text": "Airbus has struck its biggest single deal with an order for 430 aircraft worth $49.5bn at list prices from US investment firm Indigo Partners. Indigo, whose interests include Europe's Wizz Air, US-based Frontier, and Mexico's Volaris, will buy Airbus's A320neo family of aircraft. The order on the penultimate day of the Dubai Airshow comes after what could have been a difficult week for Airbus. On Sunday, Emirates appeared to snub Airbus over an A380 superjumbo deal. Indigo's managing partner, Bill Franke, 80, flew to Dubai for the signing ceremony, although there are still final details of the deal to be worked out.  He said these should be completed by the end of the year.  The Airbus aircraft, whose wings are made in the UK, will be deployed across Indigo's airlines, which also includes JetSmart in Chile. They operate what Mr Franke called an \"ultra-low cost model... To be successful you have to have a plane that can be worked hard. Airbus fits the bill.\" The Indigo deal more than doubles Airbus's existing order book for the year, which stood at about 290 aircraft as of the end of October. Wednesday's deal beats a 2015 order for 250 single-aisle planes valued at $27bn by Indian budget carrier IndiGo. The two companies are unrelated. Despite the headline list price of the Indigo order, airlines typically get discounts on bulk-buys. \"Regretfully, Indigo will not be paying $49.5bn,\" said Airbus sale chief John Leahy when asked about discounts. Clinching the deal was seen as a personal triumph for Mr Leahy, who retires at the end of the year after 20 years at Airbus and who had said he hoped to clinch one more big order before going. He has sold more than 15,000 jets worth an estimated $1.7 trillion. The Airbus announcement beats an order unveiled earlier this week by arch rival Boeing, which secured a $40bn deal for 787 Dreamliners from Emirates. That announcement, on Sunday, was due to be unveiled alongside an Emirates' order for A380s.  But the A380 announcement was cancelled minutes before a press conference convened. It is thought that Emirates asked for last-minute changes. Mr Leahy declined to say if the A380 deal could happen this week. \"You'll just have to walk over there [to Emirates' show chalet] and ask them,\" he told reporters. Meanwhile, Boeing on Wednesday announced an order from Gulf airline flydubai for 225 medium-haul 737 MAX aircraft with a list price of $27bn, hailing it as the \"largest-ever single-aisle jet order\" from a Middle East carrier. Airbus's celebration of Indigo's massive order for the A320 NEO - which at $49.5bn is its biggest ever single deal - will be muted.  The Dubai show has shown up the sharply contrasting fortunes at each end of the European plane maker's product range.  Its smallest plane, the A320, is selling like hot cakes. It can't make them fast enough.  The largest plane, the superjumbo A380, can't find a buyer. Airbus can't make them slowly enough. Read more from Dominic here.",

            "text": "Indonesian search teams have retrieved one of the two \"black boxes\" from the Boeing 737 plane that crashed into the Java Sea on Saturday, killing all 62 people on board. The flight data recorder was brought ashore, but the teams are still trying to locate the cockpit voice recorder. The authorities hope that data from the black boxes can give vital clues on the possible cause of the crash. The 26-year-old aircraft passed an airworthiness inspection last month. It was still functioning and intact before it crashed, preliminary results showed.  Flight SJ182 was en route from the capital Jakarta to the city of Pontianak on Borneo island. Separately, Indonesian police have identified the first victim - Okky Bisma, a 29-year-old flight attendant. Indonesia's transport ministry on Tuesday said the aircraft had been grounded during the pandemic, and passed an inspection on 14 December. It made its first flight five days later with no passengers before resuming commercial flights on 22 December. The National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) said that preliminary findings showed that the plane had reached the height of 10,900ft (3.3km) at 14:36 local time on Saturday (07:36 GMT), then made a steep drop to 250ft at 14:40, before it stopped transmitting data. KNKT head Soerjanto Tjahjono added that the plane's turbine disc had been found with a damaged fan blade - ruling out the theory that the plane had exploded mid-air.  \"The damaged fan blade indicates that the machine was still functioning when it crashed. This [is] also in line with the belief that the plane's system was still functioning when it reached 250ft,\" said Mr Soerjanto in a written statement to reporters.  Search teams are continuing to comb the waters at the crash site, trying to retrieve the cockpit voice recorder.  Earlier on Tuesday, the KNKT said a device used to locate the black boxes had experienced \"technical problems or equipment damage\". Several pieces of debris, body parts, wreckage and passengers' clothing have already been recovered. According to news wire AFP, some 2,600 personnel were involved in the search operation on Monday, along with more than 50 ships and 13 aircraft.  Investigators are already analysing items which they believe to be a wheel and part of the plane's fuselage. An engine turbine has also been recovered.  Safety officials say this stage of the investigation could take up to a year.  The Sriwijaya Air passenger plane departed from Jakarta's main airport at 14:36 local time (07:36 GMT) on Saturday. Minutes later, at 14:40, the last contact was recorded. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-east Asian destinations. The missing aircraft is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model that was grounded from March 2019 until last December following two deadly crashes.",

            "text": "The future of Belfast's largest employer, Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier, will be on the agenda when Theresa May meets Justin Trudeau later today.  As well as discussing a potential future free trade agreement, both Canada and the UK have reason to fear that when it comes to aircraft manufacturing, trade with the US may come with big tariffs attached. US manufacturer Boeing, with the support of Donald Trump, insists Bombardier is selling its planes to US airlines at knock down prices - only made possible by subsidies from the Canadian and UK government. When aircraft manufacturers go to war, governments rarely sit on the sidelines. The large subsidies that all aircraft manufacturers need to finance the enormous upfront costs of plane development mean that corporate disputes can, and often do, become international political incidents. This one has tentacles that affect the balance of Westminster politics. Bombardier's 4,500 strong workforce in Belfast are caught in the crossfire of a bitter trade dispute. The area surrounding the plant is very important to the DUP on whom Theresa May relies for her slender governing majority. So the politics of this dispute are jet fuelled. Not only has Theresa May been in touch with Donald Trump over the issue but the Business Secretary, Greg Clark, has visited Boeing and made more than a dozen calls to try to encourage a negotiated resolution.  You would expect him to work hard for UK business interests. Usually, he does his work behind closed doors - this time the government published a detailed rundown of his efforts. Perhaps because there was a wider audience in Northern Ireland who need to know just how hard he's been working. Theresa May and Justin Trudeau will discuss their strategy for dealing with a shared problem on this job-sensitive issue. There is a preliminary ruling on the case due later this month from the International Trade Commission. ",

            "title": "Iran plane crash: Protesters condemn 'lies' on downed jet",
            "text": "Hundreds of protesters have taken to the streets in Iran's capital, Tehran, to vent anger at officials, calling them liars for having denied shooting down a Ukrainian passenger plane. Protests took place outside at least two universities, with tear gas reportedly fired. US President Donald Trump tweeted support for the \"inspiring\" protests. Iran on Saturday admitted downing the jet \"unintentionally\", three days after the crash that killed 176 people. Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752, en route to Kyiv, was shot down on Wednesday near Imam Khomeini Airport in Tehran shortly after take-off, and only hours after Iran had fired missiles at two air bases housing US forces in Iraq.  Those attacks were Iran's response to the US killing of senior Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad on 3 January. Dozens of Iranians and Canadians, as well as nationals from Ukraine, the UK, Afghanistan and Sweden died on the plane. Students gathered outside at least two universities, Sharif and Amir Kabir, reports said, initially to pay respect to the victims. Protests turned angry in the evening. The semi-official Fars news agency carried a rare report of the unrest, saying up to 1,000 people had chanted slogans against leaders and tore up pictures of Soleimani. The students called for those responsible for the downing the plane, and those they said had covered up the action, to be prosecuted. Chants included \"commander-in-chief resign\", referring to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, and \"death to liars\". Fars said police had \"dispersed\" the protesters, who were blocking roads. Social media footage appeared to show tear gas being fired. Social media users also vented anger at the government's actions. One wrote on Twitter: \"I will never forgive the authorities in my country, the people who were on the scene and lying.\" The protests were, however, far smaller than the mass demonstrations across Iran in support of Soleimani after he was killed. President Trump tweeted in both English and Farsi, saying: \"To the brave and suffering Iranian people: I have stood with you since the beginning of my presidency and my government will continue to stand with you. \"We are following your protests closely. Your courage is inspiring.\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted video of the protests in Iran, saying: \"The voice of the Iranian people is clear. They are fed up with the regime's lies, corruption, ineptitude, and brutality of the IRGC [Revolutionary Guards] under Khamenei's kleptocracy. We stand with the Iranian people who deserve a better future.\" The UK's Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab issued an angry statement after British ambassador Rob Macaire was arrested \"without grounds or explanation\" in a \"flagrant violation of international law\" at one of the protests in Tehran. Mr Macaire was detained at the demonstration outside Amir Kabir and was later released. Mr Raab said Iran could \"continue its march towards pariah status... or take steps to de-escalate tensions and engage in a diplomatic path forwards\". For three days, Iran had denied reports its missiles had brought down the plane, with one spokesman accusing Western nations of \"lying and engaging in psychological warfare\". But on Saturday morning, a statement read on state TV accepted the plane had been shot down. Brig-Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the Revolutionary Guards' aerospace commander, explained what happened. He said a missile operator had acted independently and alone, mistaking the plane for a \"cruise missile\" as there had been reports that such missiles had been fired at Iran. \"He had 10 seconds to decide. He could have decided to strike or not to strike and under such circumstances he took the wrong decision,\" Gen Hajizadeh said. \"He was obliged to make contact and get verification. But apparently, his communications system had some disruptions.\" Gen Hajizadeh said the military would upgrade its systems to prevent such \"mistakes\" in the future. He said he had \"wished he was dead\" after being told of the missile strike. Gen Hajizadeh said he had informed the authorities about what had happened on Wednesday, raising questions about why Iran had denied involvement for so long. Ayatollah Khamenei said there was \"proof of human error\", while President Hassan Rouhani said Iran \"deeply regrets this disastrous mistake\". Foreign Minister Javad Zarif laid part of the blame on the US. \"Human error at a time of crisis caused by US adventurism led to [this] disaster,\" he said. Both Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with Mr Rouhani on Saturday. Mr Trudeau said he was \"outraged and furious\" and had told Mr Rouhani that there must be a full investigation with \"full clarity on how such a horrific tragedy could have occurred\". Mr Trudeau said: \"Canada will not rest until we get the accountability, justice and closure the families deserve... they are hurt, angry and grieving and they want answers.\" Mr Zelensky, who has demanded compensation and an apology, said Mr Rouhani had assured him that \"all persons involved in this air disaster will be brought to justice\". In the Canadian city of Edmonton, Pegah Salari is helping to organise a memorial service for the victims from the city on Sunday.   She says the latest admission by Iran means \"now it's more than grief\", first felt in the Iranian-Canadian community there. \"It's anger, frustration,\" she said.  Many on the plane were living there, including 10 people - faculty members, students, and alumni -  from the University of Alberta.  Ms Salari is openly critical and distrustful of the Iranian government and is watching news of the protests in Iran with both trepidation and hope.  There are some in the Iranian diaspora in Canada who support the government in Tehran, which can cause tension, she said.  For the moment, that has been set aside, Ms Salari says.  \"It's  not a political matter, it has nothing to do with economics. This for the first time is a human tragedy and all those lost lives has brought people closer and opened some eyes.\"",

            "title": "Aeroflot plane crash: Pilot error theory probed",
            "text": "Russian investigators are considering pilot error as a possible cause of the crash which killed 41 people on board an Aeroflot airliner at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport. Crew members and passengers say the Sukhoi Superjet-100 was struck by lightning in the air, which knocked out communications with ground control. But the high-speed landing of a fuel-laden jet was not normal practice. Meanwhile a video reveals officials joking while watching the burning jet. It is not clear who the unidentified Russian officials are, in the clip broadcast on Twitter.  A statement from the Sheremetyevo airport management said the officials belonged neither to the airport company - called AO MASH - nor to Aeroflot. The statement demands punishment for the officials in the clip, accusing them of breaching professional ethics. Amid laughter one of them is heard saying \"it landed all right, with a little flame\" while the TV monitor shows the jet engulfed in an inferno. The airliner made a hard landing 30 minutes after take-off on Sunday and burst into flames. It had taken off normally, bound for Murmansk in the far north. Video showed a ball of flame engulfing the rear of the plane, but 37 people, including four crew members, managed to flee via escape chutes in the front section. Two black box flight recorders were recovered in reasonable condition, and are being examined. But the results will not be known for a few weeks. Russia's transport ministry has decided against grounding Superjet-100s, saying there is no obvious sign of a design fault. But some aviation experts are asking why a lightning strike knocked out the plane's communications - something that should not normally happen, as modern jets are designed to withstand storms. The crash jet was relatively new, it had not had a heavy flight schedule and had undergone a routine service in April. Kommersant daily, quoting unnamed sources close to the investigation, says pilot error is seen as a strong possibility in the crash. Several factors are under scrutiny:  Pilot Denis Yevdokimov, quoted on the Russian Telegram channel Baza, said \"the fire (came) after landing, I understand... because of the landing; that was probably the reason\", and he noted that its fuel tanks were full. Aeroflot owns at least 50 Superjets and has ordered 100 more. The planes first entered service in 2011. There have been sporadic concerns over the reliability of Superjets. An Aeroflot internal document from February 2018 classed the type's safety level as \"average\", whereas all the airline's Airbus and Boeing jets had a \"high\" safety level. Sunday's disaster was the first crash of a Superjet on a commercial flight. But in 2012 a Superjet on a demonstration flight slammed into a volcano in Indonesia, killing all 45 people on board. The crash was blamed on human error. ",

            "title": "US set to impose tariffs on $7.5bn of EU exports in Airbus row",
            "text": "The US has been given the go-ahead to impose tariffs on $7.5bn (\u00a36.1bn) of goods it imports from the EU. It is the latest chapter in a 15-year battle between the US and the EU over illegal subsidies for planemakers Airbus and rival Boeing. The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling will mean tariffs on EU goods ranging from aircraft to cheese, olives and jumpers from 18 October. Brussels has threatened to retaliate similarly against US goods. US trade officials said the tariffs would be set at a 10% rate on aircraft and 25% on agricultural and other items. They have published a list of all the items that will be subject to the additional tariffs, most of which will apply to imports from France, Germany, Spain and the UK. The US said it had the authority to increase the tariffs \"at any time\" or change the products affected. Meanwhile, the two sides are waiting for the WTO to decide on what tariffs the EU can impose against the US in retaliation for US state aid given to Boeing. That ruling is expected next year. The European Commission, which has proposed tariffs on $20bn (\u00a315bn) of US goods, said it hopes to reach a settlement. \"But if the US decides to impose WTO authorised countermeasures, it will be pushing the EU into a situation where we will have no other option than do the same,\" the European Commission said. The US first filed the case in 2004, arguing that cheap European loans for Airbus amounted to illegal state subsidies. The WTO decided in favour of the US, which subsequently complained that the EU and certain member countries were not in compliance with the decision, prompting years of further wrangling. The US had sought to impose tariffs on about $11bn in goods. Though the WTO cut that figure to $7.5bn, Wednesday's decision still marks the largest penalty of its kind in the organisation's history. The WTO's dispute settlement body must formally adopt the ruling but is not expected to overturn the decision. US trade officials said the EU's settlement offer came years too late and did not resolve US concerns about ongoing subsidies. Imposing tariffs is intended to produce a better proposal, they added. \"For years, Europe has been providing massive subsidies to Airbus that have seriously injured the US aerospace industry and our workers.  \"Finally, after 15 years of litigation, the WTO has confirmed that the United States is entitled to impose countermeasures in response to the EU's illegal subsidies,\" said US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. He said the US expected to \"enter into negotiations with the European Union aimed at resolving this issue in a way that will benefit American workers.\" But governments across the EU, including the UK, called for the dispute to be resolved without the new tax. \"Resorting to tariffs is not in the interests of the UK, EU or US,\" the UK said. \"We are working closely with the US, EU and European partners to support a negotiated settlement to the Airbus and Boeing disputes\".  Bruno Le Maire, France's finance minister, said the country was \"ready to respond firmly with our European partners\". \"A friendly resolution to the Boeing/Airbus dispute is the best solution, and all the more so given that Europe could impose sanctions on the US next year,\" he said. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel said: \"A decision has been made based on international law through which Airbus will be affected unfortunately and we will see how the Americans will react\". These tariffs are separate to US President Donald Trump's ongoing trade disputes with countries around the world. Those were sparked in March 2018 when his administration announced tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium imported into the US. It prompted the EU to impose \u20ac2.8bn (\u00a32.4bn) of duties on US goods such as bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and orange juice last June. Mr Trump is also considering raising import duties on European cars. While the Boeing-Airbus fight pre-dates Mr Trump, another wave of tariffs adds to concerns about global trade, which has slowed significantly amid the many disputes. On Wednesday, Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury warned that hitting aircraft with the import duties would disrupt the industry, raise costs and hurt the broader economy - including in the US. Close to 40% of Airbus's aircraft-related procurement comes from US aerospace suppliers, which it said it supports 275,000 American jobs in 40 states. \"Airbus is therefore hopeful that the US and the EU will agree to find a negotiated solution before creating serious damage to the aviation industry as well as to trade relations and the global economy,\" Mr Faury said. BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker said tensions in global trade had already risen since President Trump took office.  \"It's worth remembering that the International Monetary Fund and others see trade conflict as one of the biggest risks to the global economic outlook,\" he added.",

            "text": "Passengers on Etihad flights from Abu Dhabi to the US will be able to use larger gadgets, such as laptops, during their journey. Regulations requiring passengers to put laptops and other gadgets in baggage in the hold were introduced in March. The airline said its plan to conduct \"enhanced inspections\" of passengers had convinced the US to lift its restrictions.  The airline runs 45 flights per week from Abu Dhabi to six US airports.  The US-imposed restrictions affected flights to and from 10 airports in eight majority-Muslim countries, and were prompted by fears that larger devices could be used to conceal bombs. The ban said any device larger than 16cm by 9.3cm by 1.5cm (6.3in by 3.7in by 0.6in) had to be put into checked baggage.  Smartphones and medical devices are exempt from the US-imposed ban. The extra checks carried out at Abu Dhabi international airport effectively mean passengers go through US customs and border screening before they take off rather than after they touch down on American soil. The extra screening and checking would make \"minimal\" difference to the time passengers spent going through security, a spokesman for Abu Dhabi airport told Reuters. A spokesman for the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said it hoped other airlines and airports covered by the restrictions would follow suit.  The Dubai airports authority is believed to be working with the DHS to replicate the system set up in Abu Dhabi.  Late last month, the US demanded authorities in 105 other nations carry out more thorough checks on passengers and devices but stopped short of extending the laptop ban.",

            "text": "US plane maker Boeing is facing questions after an Ethiopian Airlines 737 crash on Sunday killed all 157 people on board.  It was the second crash in five months involving a 737 Max 8, and comparisons are being drawn with a Lion Air accident in Indonesia last October. In response, a number of airlines have now grounded all planes of the same model. However, experts warn it is too early to say what caused the latest disaster.  Ethiopian Airlines says the plane, flight ET302, crashed at 08:44 local time (05:44 GMT), just six minutes after it left Addis Ababa. The aircraft, bound for Nairobi, came down near the town of Bishoftu, 60km (37 miles) south-east of the capital.  The pilot had reported difficulties and had asked to return to Addis Ababa, the airline said. \"At this stage, we cannot rule out anything,\" Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde Gebremariam told reporters at Bole International Airport in the capital. Visibility was said to be good but air traffic monitor Flightradar24 reported that the plane's \"vertical speed was unstable after take-off\". The pilot was named as Senior Captain Yared Getachew who had a \"commendable performance\" with more than 8,000 hours in the air, the airline said. Passengers from more than 30 countries were on board the flight, including 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, and seven Britons. At least 19 victims were affiliated with the United Nations, according to a UN official.  Some passengers were heading to a session of the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi which began with a minute's silence on Monday. Slovak MP Anton Hrnko also confirmed via Facebook that his wife and two children were on the plane. Meanwhile, a Greek man has said that he was due to board the flight but arrived at the gate two minutes late. In a Facebook post, Antonis Mavropoulos shared an image of his ticket and said it was his \"lucky day\". \"I was angry because nobody helped me to reach the gate on time,\" he wrote. \"I'm grateful to be alive.\" In Ethiopia, Monday has been declared as a national day of mourning. The 737 Max-8 aircraft has only been in commercial use since 2017.  The plane that crashed was among six of 30 that Ethiopian Airlines had ordered as part of its expansion. It underwent a \"rigorous first check maintenance\" on 4 February, the airline tweeted. Boeing said it was \"deeply saddened\" by the crash and is sending a team to provide technical assistance. Following the Lion Air crash last October, investigators said the pilots had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling - a new feature of the Boeing 737 Max. The anti-stall system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, despite efforts by pilots to correct this, preliminary findings suggest. The crash killed 189 people. The Lion Air plane was also new and the accident happened soon after take-off.  \"It's highly suspicious,\" Mary Schiavo, former Inspector General of the US Transportation Department, told CNN.  \"Here we have a brand-new aircraft that's gone down twice in a year. That rings alarm bells in the aviation industry, because that just doesn't happen.\" After last October's crash, Boeing sent an emergency notice to airlines warning them of a problem with the anti-stall system.  Boeing is expected to release a software patch to the system to deal with this issue, according to Reuters.  However, with the Ethiopian Airlines investigation at an early stage, it is not clear whether the anti-stall system was the cause of Sunday's crash. Aviation experts say other technical issues or human error cannot be discounted.  Ethiopian Airlines has a good safety reputation, although in 2010 one of the company's aeroplanes crashed in the Mediterranean Sea shortly after leaving Beirut. The investigation will be led by Ethiopian authorities co-ordinating with teams of experts from Boeing and the US National Transportation Safety Board. An urgent priority for investigators will be to find the plane's two cockpit recorders - one for data and another for pilots' voice recordings. Ethiopian Airlines said in a tweet on Monday morning that it had grounded all of its 737 MAX 8s \"until further notice.\" \"Although we don't know the cause of the accident, we had to decide to ground the particular fleet as an extra safety precaution.\"  The airline used a different model of plane for its first flight to Kenya since the crash which landed at 10:25 local time on Monday. China's aviation regulator has also ordered local airlines to halt the flights of 737 Max 8s.  More than 90 are in use by Chinese carriers including Air China, China Eastern Airlines, and China Southern Airlines. Cayman Airways also grounded its two Boeings of the same type. But a spokeswoman for FlyDubai, which operates a number of 737 Max 8s, told Reuters that the company continues to have confidence in the aircraft. Several North American airlines operate the same aircraft and have said they are monitoring the investigation. Southwest Airlines flies 31, while American Airlines and Air Canada each have 24 in their fleet.",

The Farnborough Airshow, being held for the first time in four years, is expected to feature some 1,200 exhibitors from 42 countries, and attract more than 80,000 visitors. It will be noisy and colourful, with the Red Arrows, South Korea's Black Eagles Display Team, an RAF Typhoon and a US Air Force F-35 all dropping by during the flying displays. Since the last show in 2018, the Covid pandemic has had a major impact on commercial aviation, while the war in Ukraine has dramatically changed the outlook for the defence industry. That means this year's event offers an opportunity to gauge the mood of businesses, and assess how they are coping in a very different world. Some things, though, have not changed.  The pressure to cut emissions and become less environmentally damaging is as strong as ever - and \"sustainability\" is likely to be one of the main buzzwords in the vast exhibition halls and plush chalets. Under normal circumstances, Farnborough alternates with the Salon du Bourget in Paris as the most prestigious aerospace industry gathering of the year. It's a place where executives in sharp suits mingle with military types in gold braid and dark glasses, in the shadow of billions of pounds worth of state-of-the art machinery. Before Covid, it was used as an opportunity for showmanship, to boast of vast new orders. The airline sector was growing rapidly - and all forecasts suggested that would continue. But the outbreak brought the good times to an end very abruptly. Airlines were hardly flying in many regions. Aircraft were grounded, and factories slowed.  Now a recovery is clearly under way, and those behind the show are convinced confidence is returning. \"The world has really not flown much for the past three years,\" explains Kevin Craven, chief executive of the UK aerospace trade association ADS. \"So the proof that the industry has both used the time well and is absolutely looking forward to the future, I think is a really symbolic moment.\" Inevitably, there will be a focus on the two giants of the commercial sector, Airbus and Boeing. Of the two, the US manufacturer has had the most difficult time over the past few years. The company will be bringing its 737 Max 10 to the show. This is the newest, and largest, version of the 737 Max - a relative of the design that was involved in two fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia. Boeing is hoping that the plane, a highly efficient long-range model, will allow it to compete with Airbus' A321neo, and help in the rehabilitation of the Max brand. But there are problems looming. It looks unlikely that the aircraft will be certified by regulators before the end of the year. If it is not, it will be subject to new safety rules governing cockpit alerts. These would force Boeing to make changes to the flight deck, meaning that pilots coming from other variants of the 737 Max would need extra training, raising costs for airlines, and making the plane a potentially less attractive proposition.  The company has demanded a waiver from the new rules, and chief executive Dave Calhoun has warned if that doesn't happen, there is a risk the programme could be cancelled. As if that wasn't enough, the aerospace giant has yet to resume deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner. These have been halted for more than a year due to a litany of production and quality control problems, though approval from regulators is expected soon. All told, Boeing and Dave Calhoun really need a good show, with strong orders, to build confidence and appease disgruntled investors.  Airbus, meanwhile, is going into the show in upbeat mood.  The company forecast earlier this month that demand for passenger air traffic would increase by 3.6% a year for the next two decades, and that pressure to reduce emissions would increase demand for fuel-efficient aircraft.  It believes its own fleet, including planes such as the A320neo, A350 and A321XLR will be well-positioned to benefit. In fact, as executives swelter in what is forecast to be a very un-British heatwave, cutting carbon emissions is likely to be one of the main topics of conversation. \"In some ways Covid brought the challenge of decarbonisation to the forefront, as you had this period of time with almost no flights and therefore no emissions,\" explains John Coykendall, head of Deloitte's US and global aerospace and defence practice. \"Now all of a sudden, as travel comes roaring back, so do the emissions associated with it.  \"The industry's made a big commitment to get to net zero by 2050\u2026 and I think you're going to see lots of discussion at the show about how you really reach that goal.\" Such discussions are likely to focus on sustainable aviation fuels, electrification and long-term plans for a new generation of hydrogen-powered planes. Several companies, such as British start-up Vertical Aerospace, Germany's Lilium Aerospace and Californian firm Joby Aviation will be talking up their plans for electric air taxis.  In the defence sector, meanwhile, change is also in the air. The conflict in Ukraine has challenged existing assumptions - and boosted national defence budgets in many countries. \"Even before the Ukraine situation, we were already seeing this pivot away from counter-insurgency capabilities to much more focus on near-peer adversaries, and the capabilities you need in those circumstances,\" explains Deloitte's John Coykendall. \"Now you add in significant growth in spending, from Nato countries in particular\u2026 I think we're going to see a lot of discussions between government military representatives and the different defence contractors that are at the show, checking out products and talking about potential deals.\" And ultimately, deals - usually measured in billions or even tens of billions of dollars - are what Farnborough is all about.

            "text": "Amateur enthusiasts are creating planes and helicopters out of recycled parts and little training. So why aren\u2019t countries doing more to harness this talent? Its propellers are powered by an engine that once milled animal feed. Aluminium bars, bolts and plastic sheeting bought from a local shop and held together with cheap gum make up the frame. A large crowd applauds enthusiastically as young farmhand Onesmus Mwangi publically unveils the 25-kilogramme (55-lb) helicopter he has built from salvaged scrap in his backyard in the village of Magomano, Kenya. And for good reason. Mwangi, 20, dropped out of school at the age of 12 and has no formal technical training. His labour of love took up every spare waking moment outside his farm job for over seven months, not to mention his savings of 57,000 Kenyan Shillings ($650) \u2013 about a year-and-a-half\u2019s salary for him. He is, of course, not the first person to build a helicopter. We can\u2019t even be sure his machine actually flies. The engine works and he claims it has flown a few feet, although this cannot be confirmed. Regardless, his raw talent and determination have attracted local, national and even international recognition. In recent years the media has highlighted a series of similarly inspiring achievements by other African amateur aviation enthusiasts, whose flying machines have been created with scant resources and little training. Some have achieved lift-off, others haven\u2019t. Their stories are different, and yet linked by parallels in the barriers they have faced and overcome, and their motivations for doing so. For at least as long ago as the Wright Brothers\u2019 first powered flight in 1903, novice tinkerers and expert engineers have engaged in innovative aviation projects, varying in size and scale. Canadian engineer Paul Moller, for example, has put a good part of the last 40 years and at least $100 million into developing the Moller Skycar 400, an affordable personal aircraft that takes off and lands vertically. Then there is Toronto-based Jay Godsall, who is developing an aeroplane-airship hybrid with a helium-filled chamber and solar cells designed to get into remote locations for disaster relief, exploration and research. Aeronautical innovators in the developing world have fewer resources, but they have similar motivations, says Emeka Okafor, curator of Maker Faire Africa, an annual pan-African event that showcases ingenuity and innovation. \u201cIn any society, there\u2019s always a subset of individuals with an interest in tinkering, fabricating, mimicking, inventing,\u201d says Okafor. \u201cAt the very fundamental level, what drives them is curiosity. On top of that, it\u2019s problem solving, or addressing gaps they see in society.\u201d Social recognition and material rewards matter too. \u201cI built the helicopter to showcase my talent, hoping that people would invest in me and give me an opportunity to build bigger and better things,\u201d says Mwangi. Support network The rise of the internet and social media in particular has brought greater attention to such efforts over the last decade. Gabriel Nderitu Muturi, another Kenyan, spent three years building a homemade two-seater aircraft running on a 40-litre Toyota engine. In 2010 he was forced to give up on this model, which failed to get off the ground due to \u201cmany troubles with weight and engine power\u201d, as he wrote in a report on his efforts. Last year he designed and built a lighter single-seater, and is currently planning remote-controlled tests. Then there is the Somaliland trio Mohamed Abdi Barkadle, Saed Abdi Jide and Abdi Farah Lidan, who, in 2010, built a helicopter from an old van engine and scrap metal with no financial support, with the aim of using it to fight fires. It is unclear whether their chopper ever made it off the ground. Jide cites a \u201clack of money and time\u201d as the main challenges. However, greater exposure is not enough to help them overcome the tremendous barriers they face, which extend far beyond time and money. First, of course, is the technical challenge. \u201cBuilding an aircraft is incredibly complicated,\u201d says Jim Gaunt, a bush pilot and mechanic based in Nairobi who\u2019s been flying planes in Kenya for over 30 years. \u201cEverything you put into an aeroplane has to get off the ground.\" Car and aircraft engines are very similar, however those that power cars are heavier, and made for rapid acceleration and deceleration, while those in aircraft are made lighter, and to run at a more steady speed. And of course while a Toyota or Honda engine can be found in many junkyards, cheap aircraft engines are far harder to come by. Then, there is the cultural aspect. \u201cWhat we have in most parts of Africa are lone wolf inventors, fabricators and dreamers, who unfortunately lack the types of support systems that are found in developed countries,\u201d says Okafor. A relative lack of financial and physical resources, and of education and training environments that foster innovation, in many African countries helps explain why the odds are stacked against these individuals. But it\u2019s also frequently rooted in a failure of governments to recognise the role of innovation in development, which in turn comes from deeper societal attitudes. In many African countries those who are most revered in history books are nation builders and founders, who, more often than not, were writers, artists, poets and politicos. The equivalents of the likes of Thomas Edison and Henry Ford feature far less prominently. \u201cIn Africa, they are invisible,\u201d says Okafor. Faced with this combination of obstacles, those driven by the passion to innovate face an uphill battle. After Mwangi unveiled his helicopter in April, his employer fired him, claiming the media attention was interfering with his work. Then, the local authorities confiscated his chopper, saying it was a \u201csecurity risk\u201d. The police have since returned it, but have forbidden Mwangi from flying it. \u2018Waste of talent\u2019 And yet sometimes these innovators do get the rewards as well as recognition. In 2007, 24-year-old Nigerian physics student Mubarak Muhammed Abdullahi spent nearly a year building a 12-metre (39ft) long helicopter out of spare parts sourced from old cars, motorcycles, and even a crashed Boeing 747, using money he saved from repairing cell phones and computers. \u201cWhen I was a kid I loved helicopters,\u201d says Abdullahi. \u201cWhenever I saw one in the movies, I used to ask \u2018how does this thing work?\u201d Years later when he told his college friends of his plan to build one, they laughed. \u201cOnly whites can build things like that,\u201d they said. His response was to build a bright yellow helicopter with push-button ignition, an accelerator lever and a joystick for thrust and bearing. It was powered by a 133-horsepower engine salvaged from a Honda Civic. Unlike the flying machines of many other amateur aviation innovators, Abdullahi\u2019s contraption actually flew, although never above a height of 2.1 metres (7ft). But it did earn him international recognition, a TED Global Fellowship and a scholarship to study aircraft maintenance in the UK. He now has a well paid job working for an electronics manufacturer in the UK, but dreams of starting his own aircraft company. He reflects that he got little support from the Nigerian government, and says the barriers faced by people like him result in a tremendous \u201cwaste of talent\u201d in Africa. These stories beg an important question: how can Africa better encourage and harness the talents of its aero-innovators? \u201cThat person in Africa building his own chopper is someone who can make things happen, who is willing to take risks,\u201d says Robert Weiss, President of the X Prize Foundation, which creates global competitions with multi-million dollar prizes to fuel innovation. Weiss says he would like to encourage greater participation from amateurs based in developing world countries in future X Prize challenges. Okafor, however, is not convinced this approach will help. \u201cOne of the reasons prizes work in the US and elsewhere is because you already have the basics in place \u2013 infrastructure, spaces, labs, etc,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have those basics, even for someone who may want to participate in a prize project, there are a lot of limitations.\u201d He sees more potential in the establishment of creative community workshops such as the hundreds of \u201cMaker Spaces\u201d, \u201chackerspaces\u201d and \u201cfab labs\u201d that have sprung up around the world. These open spaces offer access to equipment such as laser cutters and 3D printers, as well as computing facilities and advanced design software. Individuals can realise their ideas, as well as making links so they can collaborate in a supportive environment. Such spaces do exist in South Africa, Egypt, Togo, Ghana, Kenya and elsewhere in Africa, but Okafor would like to see a great many more. He and others believe that the ultimate success or failure of projects undertaken by the likes of Mwangi, Muturi, Abdullahi and the Somaliland trio is less important than what they learn along the way, and where that takes them and their societies in future. \u00a0\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t overlook or underestimate what these folks are doing,\u201d Okafor says. \u201cWhether they fly or not is not really important. These individuals have an interest in this form of transport. Can we imagine what they would be able to do if they had enabling environments?\u201d If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",

            "text": "The airliner of the future may feel very alien to our fuel-guzzling planes, at least if one ambitious quest to build the Prius of the skies is anything to go by. How would you feel about flying on an electric airliner? Current planes may be noisy, rattly, and relatively inefficient, but there\u2019s something reassuring about being able to hear the constant roar of the engines, or glance out of the window and see them. So the airliner of the future may feel very alien to anyone comfortable with our current mode of flying \u2013 at least if an ambitious model called the eConcept is anything to go by. Designed by European aviation powerhouse, EADS (which announced it will be renamed Airbus Group next year), together with Rolls Royce, the eConcept shows how cutting-edge technology and materials could combine to make more efficient and quiet aircraft that take their cues from the hybrid-car model. \u201cWe imagine the impossible, and then try to think how possible it might be,\u201d Professor Ric Parker, Chief Technical Officer of Rolls Royce tells me. \u201cWe don\u2019t just do science fiction. We want things that are maybe a stretch for today\u2019s technology, but where the basic laws of physics aren\u2019t being broken. That\u2019s the bounds we are setting ourselves.\u201d Ambitious claims require ambitious ideas, and Rolls Royce is proposing something completely different to a traditional propeller driven by an electric motor \u2013 like other efforts being tested. Its system, known as E\u2013Thrust, is what Rolls Royce calls a distributed electrical power system. Instead of several engines slung under the wings, E\u2013Thrust will use a single turbine engine towards the back of the aircraft. \u201cThe turbine is connected to a generator, and it does not provide any thrust to propel the aeroplane,\u201d insists Dr Jean Botti, EADS Chief Technical Officer. \u201cIt is just there to drive the generator.\u201d The rearward positioning means that the engine\u2019s air intake can help reduce drag by sucking in and therefore reducing what is known as the boundary layer \u2013 an area of air flow next to the surface of the plane that causes the most resistance. Less drag means greater efficiency. \u201cA conventional aircraft looks like a tube, with two wings and two engines, all designed by people who have never met each other,\u201d says Parker. The E\u2013thrust system is a much more integrated design, where the propulsion system is actually built into the body of the aircraft. \u201cThis makes the aircraft much more efficient even without all the exciting electrical technology,\u201d says Parker. The electricity generated is fed to six \u201cducted fans\u201d, three per side, that will provide the thrust needed to drive the plane forwards. Because those fans are smaller than a conventional jet engine, they will also be integrated into the body of the plane, above the wings, which further reduces drag and noise. Power boost To get it off the ground, though, the eConcept requires some technologies that haven\u2019t yet been fully developed. Key amongst them is superconductivity. Superconducting materials have super-low electrical resistance, meaning that motors and current carrying cables can be lighter and thinner \u2013 crucial in an aircraft. But they usually have to be kept at temperatures close to absolute zero, which means the concept plane will need a cryogenic coolant system. Newer superconducting materials are being developed that operate at ever\u2013higher temperatures. \u201cThose materials exist today, and are in the research labs of universities,\u201d says Parker. \u201cMaking them into wires and real devices is the next big challenge.\u201d If and when the technologies mature enough, the eConcept will operate in a manner similar to a hybrid car. It will use batteries for energy storage, and they will act as a buffer. On take off, where maximum power is needed, the turbine generator and the batteries will divert all power to the fans. Then when the plane reaches a cruising altitude some power from the turbine can be diverted to recharge the batteries, and the fans can be used to regenerate power too. You could be forgiven for thinking that this sounds great on paper (or in an animated video), but the companies involved are keen to stress that this vision of the future could come sooner than we might imagine. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that far off, maybe 2030,\u201d says Parker. \u201cI might just get a ride on one in my lifetime!\u201d Another hybrid effort following a similar launch timeline is part of the Sugar (Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research) project, supported by Nasa and led by Boeing. Called Sugar Volt, batteries stored in the belly of the plane would be charged at the gate by sucking electricity from the airport's power grid. It would use traditional fuel-powered engines for takeoff, but then switch to electric power once it reaches cruising altitude, and as a consequence would require only 30% of the fuel that current planes use. There is one big barrier to development, though, and that\u2019s below-par battery performance. EADS is testing its technology on a smaller scale with a two-seater aircraft called the E-Fan, which uses electric fans for thrust. The E-Fan has a wingspan of just over 9 metres (31 feet), and gets its power from two multi-cell lithium ion battery packs in each wing root. According to its designers this provides just under an hour\u2019s flying at around 160kph (100 mph). The hope is that the E-Fan should fly for the first time before the end of the year, and the E\u2013Thrust passenger plane will follow in coming years, according to Botti. \u201cWe are going to continue to develop this technology,\u201d he says, \u201cand push very hard to make it a reality.\u201d If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",

            "text": "The idea of having a part car, part plane, part drone parked outside your home may not be as far-fetched as it seems. There really aren\u2019t any technological hurdles to this. We are going to have personal air vehicles that are both cars and planes, at least that\u2019s Missy Cummings\u2019s vision of the future. It\u2019s basically the intersection of a drone with a robotic car, so that your plane is also your car, but the big leap in technology is that you are actually driving neither, says the Associate Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Drones have a negative bias in the media, says Cummings, because they are essentially seen as spy cameras. But most people don\u2019t realise that when they are on a plane they are effectively travelling on a drone. The fly-by-wire technology that exists on all Airbus and many Boeing craft is the exact same technology that exists on drones. The reason why drones are the answer to the future is that the truth is we are terrible drivers. Humans inherently have a half-second lag in almost any quick response that they need to have, like a ball rolling out in a street or seeing an aircraft in the sky and you have to take evasive action. Even a half-second delay can mean the difference between life and death, and computers and automated systems don\u2019t have that \u2013 they have microseconds. So, our transportation network of the future, both on the ground and in the air, will actually be safer when we turn it over to computers. There really aren\u2019t any technological hurdles to this idea, says Cummings. The biggest hurdles we have are psychological and cultural, in terms of giving up the car. But no new tech needs to be developed to have your own personal flying car. What we have to do is improve production and reduce manufacturing costs, and what that means is that we need more robots. So this is almost a self-circular process, where we need robots to build robots to make them cheaper. Should we worry about the machines rising up and taking over? No, what Cummings says she is worried about is hackers and terrorists who want to do wrong. One of the things she is working on is trying to develop technology that allows any flying robot to be able to fend off any attack and be able to navigate itself without any GPS or any other external signal. There are lots of different possibilities for what your personal air vehicle could look like. You could own your own in your driveway or garage, and you could jump in it. Or we could have a shared network like the plane version of Zipcar. People should be excited about this: it promises much in terms of safer travel, and in parts of the world where the road and air networks are poor, people will be able to get the goods and services they need. So, when we look at globalising this concept of personal air vehicles, it means we will see the quality of life improve dramatically for everyone around the world.

            "text": "Modern airliners go through a series of exhaustive tests, from the earliest stages of design, to make sure they are as safe as possible. Katia Moskvitch lifts the lid on some of the stresses plane-makers put them through \u2013 from Arctic freezing to shooting chickens at the cockpit. Aeroplanes have moved on more than a little since the first aviators soared into the sky, clad in leather jackets, caps and goggles. Back then, they needed quite an element of faith before taking to their flying machines. One hundred years on, they board highly complex machines often made from unusual materials such as carbon fibre and flying partly thanks to computers. The days of flying on \u201ca wing and a prayer\u201d are over. Nowadays, aircraft testing is incredibly elaborate and rigorous. New planes only make it into the air after a long list of tests \u2013 from chucking chickens into jet engines to simulate bird strikes to bending the wings to extreme angles. In the last 10 years, the testing methods have undergone major changes\u2013 both on the ground and in computer simulations. The aim, in both cases, is to minimise the number of hours testing planes in flight. Accidents of the past \u2013 such as the crash of an airliner at Dallas Fort-Worth in 1985 during a thunderstorm, or the electrical fault which brought down a TWA flight near New York in 1996 \u2013 spurred aircraft designers to bring in more and more safety features into new aircraft at the design stage, long before they started carrying paying passengers. Bending wingsMany of us have experienced a bumpy ride on a plane, but the routine \u2013 albeit always scary \u2013of sudden drops or wobbling wings is nothing compared to what an aircraft is subjected to when undergoing tests. Many modern passenger jets can flex their wings nearly 90 degrees in a test rig. To see how the wings and fuselage would behave under both normal and exceptional loads during their life, manufacturers perform so-called \u201cstatic tests.\u201d Airbus, for example, performed the ultimate load test on a specially built static airframe of its A350 XWB Airbus in December 2013. The plane\u2019s wings received loads of up to 1.5 times higher than they would ever encounter in service. And at ultimate load, the plane\u2019s wingtip deflection exceeded five metres \u2013 that means the load bent the wing up almost 90 degrees. The final test involves getting the aircraft wings to snap \u2013 this helps find out their breaking point, and ensures it is well beyond the predicted load level. Ingestion tests: birds and waterIf an aeroplane encounters a flock of geese on its way to warmer climes, it\u2019s not only a bloody encounter for the birds, it is also a major risk for those inside the plane. Even small birds can cause an engine to stall or explode. \u00a0According to a recent study conducted by the International Bird Strike Committee, there is only about one accident that results in human death in one billion flying hours. Most bird strikes cause little damage to the plane \u2013 but the collision is very often fatal to the bird. And such accidents cause damage to commercial aircraft costing some $1.2bn to repair every year.One of the aviation pioneers, Cal Rodgers, was the first person to die from a bird strike. In 1912, his aircraft collided with a gull over Long Beach, California that became tangled in his plane\u2019s control cables. Rodgers\u2019 plane crashed and he drowned. Bird strikes are still a cause for concern, even as planes become more sophisticated and resilient. On 15 January 2009, a US Airways Airbus A320 collided with a flock of geese, and both engines were disabled. The plane ditched into New York's Hudson River in a text-book crash landing on water, with all 155 passengers and crew safe evacuating safely. To ensure that engines continue to operate even after a bird strike, engine manufacturers do just that: throw dead birds into test engines on the ground with a so-called \u201cchicken gun\u201d\u2013 a large-diameter, compressed-air cannon. The chicken gun was invented in the 1950s by de Havilland in the UK; freshly killed chickens were packed into a compressed air gun and fired at the windscreen and engines. Aircraft manufacturers also simulate bird strikes at cockpits, also using the gun to propel birds onto a windshield, to ensure that it won\u2019t break the plane\u2019s windows or change the way it flies. \u201cWe have used fowl to test aircraft structures,\u201d says Adam Tischler, of Boeing\u2019s Flight Test Communications Division. \u201cThis is not a common test, however it can be an effective way to evaluate the results of a bird strike on an aircraft.\u201d Water can be another issue. To test what happens when large amounts of water get into the engine, for example in case of heavy rain, planes taxi through a specially made water trough. \u201cThese tests assess the correct functioning of engines and thrust reversers, as well as braking systems, when submitted to water thrown up by the wheels in cases of standing water on the runway,\u201d says Justin Dubon of Airbus. Other tests, such as those which Boeing undertakes, force a steady stream of water or fire loosely compacted ice into the engines to mimic the effects of cruising through a hail cloud. Hot and cold testsTo make sure engines, systems and materials work properly under extremely hot temperatures and at high altitude, manufacturers stage a \u201chot and high campaign\u201d\u2013 to test aircraft in intense heat and freezing conditions.For example, to examine the latest Airbus A350 XWB\u2019s ability to withstand freezing temperatures, the plane manufacturer\u2019s engineers took it to Iqaluit, the capital of Canada's Arctic territory of Nunavut. It stayed there for a week, and the tests included operating the plane on the ground and in the air in temperatures as low as -28C (-18F) and performing thrust-reversed tests with snow \u2013 basically, the effects of sudden braking that you might find on an aborted take-off. The trials also include powering-up the aircraft after long periods at\u00a0 low temperatures, says Dubon. Planes also spend about a week carrying out similar tests at high altitude airfields like Cochabamba and La Paz (Bolivia), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) and others. La Paz is one of the world\u2019s highest airports at 13,300ft (4km) above sea level, and Cochabamba is at around 8,300ft (2.5km) feet. Using a plane at such high altitude airfields puts a huge strain on the engines and other systems. To test that everything operates smoothly, tests include several take-offs with all engines operating and with simulated engine failures, and the autopilot behaviour during automatic landings and go-arounds (aborted landings) is also checked. \u201cThe aim of such trials is to validate full functionality of the engines, systems, materials... and to ensure that the passengers, if ever in this scenario, are always in a comfortable environment,\u201d says Dubon. Wind tunnels, meanwhile, allow manufacturers to test all phases of flight \u2013 including extreme conditions. For instance, Boeing conducts tests at its Research Aerodynamics Icing Tunnel (Brait), says Adam Tischler, of Boeing\u2019s Test & Evaluation department. It\u2019s in there that the company inserts a cross section of a wing to test de-icing systems. The tunnel can test speeds between 60 and 250 knots (110kp/h to 463kp/h) in temperatures as low as -40C (-40F), says Tischler. The facility allows Boeing to simulate many kinds of rain, ice and cloud conditions that aeroplanes might encounter. Virtual plane: Iron BirdOne of the most cutting-edge ways of testing modern planes involves building the guts of the aircraft on the ground and then testing these systems digitally. Bombardier, for instance, has built a ground testing facility called \u201cAircraft Zero\u201d (Complete Integrated Aircraft Systems Test Area or Ciasta) in Montreal. It\u2019s basically a rig that has all the key systems of a typical plane. It is used \u201cto simulate an aircraft in flight virtually even before the actual aircraft takes to the sky\u201d says Bomardier\u2019s Sebastien Mullot.The simulation uses high tech full aircraft system layouts on the ground called Iron Birds. \u201cIron-birds can simulate all flight segments such as take-off, cruise, landing, and so on, so that the aircraft is virtually tested on \u2018real\u2019 flights such as London to Dubai without any actual flight taking place,\u201d says Mullot. \u201cAll this can be done well before the first pieces of the first aircraft to fly are assembled.\u201dThe simulation helps anticipate any potential structural issues such as miniature cracks that could appear at a specific point of an aircraft\u2019s service life, says Mullot.It is even possible to virtually test for bird strikes on the cockpit and on the wing\u2019s leading edge. \u201cWe can predict the structure behaviour according to any weight of the bird and any impact point,\u201d says Jean-Louis Montel, deputy head of the design office at Dassault Aviation, a French aircraft maker. \u201cThis way, during the real test, a \u2018calibrated\u2019 bird is used and only critical impact points are tested.\u201dEngineers also carry out ultrasound tests on where the wing meets the fuselage; it allows \u00a0to look inside the material and find possible defects without having to take the plane apart.Lightning testsOn average, every commercial plane is hit by lightning about once a year, according to the Cardiff University\u2019s \u201clightning lab\u201d in the UK \u2013 a recently established laboratory where Airbus, for example, conducts lightning tests. The university\u2019s lab is formally called the Morgan Botti Laboratory at the School of Engineering. Despite lightning strikes, traditional aluminium planes are usually able to continue their journey safely \u2013 the high electrical conductivity of aluminium can dissipate the electricity through the aircraft structure quickly without causing any damage. But not all planes are made from metal anymore: to reduce weight and therefore fuel consumption, next-generation aircraft are built from new and much lighter materials such as carbon fibre, which tend to have much lower electrical conductivity than aluminium, says Airbus\u2019s Matthew Cole. This can lead to up to 25% improvement in fuel efficiency. These materials, however, need to be protected against lightning strike. It is usually done by adding a thin layer of metal mesh or foil. \u201cThis layer is safe and effective and successfully dissipates the charge, mitigating damage,\u201d says Cole. The problem, though, is that it adds weight. At Cardiff\u2019s lightning lab, researchers are looking for other solutions to protect systems against strikes, while maintaining safety levels and without adding weight. The work involves \u201cputting panels through lightning strike tests to better understand the reaction of different materials,\u201d says Cole. Discharges can be up to 100,000 amps \u2013 enough to power a small town. At Boeing, there are two different systems to test for lightning. One is a two megavolt high voltage generator that produces a lightning \u201cstrike\u201d indoors and can mimic where the lightning will attach on an airplane in flight. The second system is a 50-60 kilovolts high current system that can output 200,000 amps to simulate a powerful strike on the airplane\u2019s skin. We\u2019ve come a very long way since the early 1950s, when the early commercial jet liners such as Britain\u2019s pioneering Comet suffered serious problems, some of them resulting in fatal crashes. Ever since, aircraft manufacturers have been searching for ever more sophisticated ways for testing their planes. So next time you encounter turbulence or bad weather on a flight, be assured that your plane has survived much worse.

            "text": "Covid-19 has caused unprecedented turmoil in the aviation industry. What does that mean for pricing when planes take to the skies again? As more countries start to ease their Covid-19 lockdowns, attention is returning to the global aviation industry, almost entirely grounded for months. Some passenger airlines have kept skeleton fleets flying for repatriation missions, some have converted passenger jets to use as cargo planes, but all of them would much rather return to their primary objective: flying people safely around the world. But when planes do take to the skies again, how much impact will the pandemic have on what they charge? \u201cWe know airlines want to get planes back in the air and bums back on seats,\u201d says Benjamin Cany from Amadeus, a technology company that provides IT services to the travel industry, including one of its principal booking systems. In the short-term at least, that would point to lower fares aimed at incentivising consumers. Yet look past the next few months and there are factors that could push fares up, from airline bankruptcies that could reduce both supply and competition, to reduced fleets caused by retiring aircraft early. And the great unknown is how quickly passengers will return to flying, with the general feeling in the industry that aviation won\u2019t return to pre-pandemic numbers until 2022, 2023 or beyond.\u00a0\u00a0 Airlines, Cany says, usually look at past demand to forecast future trends. But there\u2019s no precedent for the current circumstances. \u201cWhat are airlines to do when the past data is radically different, or no longer relevant for future calculations?\u201d The pricing equation Airline pricing, explains Cany, is normally based on a combination of scientific calculations and models. This, he says, \u201cis about understanding the customer's motivation to travel and how much they are willing to pay for the ticket. Airlines then balance that against capacity, and a myriad other indicators. The airline wants to strike the best deal for the airline and the traveller.\u201d This is both a science and an art. The science, Cany says, \u201cis in the modelling, machine learning and algorithms behind this calculation\u201d and would usually include \u201cthe choice between the different airline products (for example, business versus premium economy) and the various airline itineraries available (departure time, arrival time, trip duration). That needs to be combined with historical data, seasonality, as well as market indicators such as upcoming local events, competition on that same route, and so forth.\u201d The art, meanwhile, comes from \u201cthe airline\u2019s pricing and revenue management experts, who adjust these indicators to develop the most accurate forecast. That\u2019s where the technology helps, providing these teams with the tools to improve the forecast accuracy to the highest degree,\u201d Cany concludes. But nobody knows how the models that aviation has been honing for decades will change as a result of the extraordinary Covid-19 challenges, particularly given the situation is still evolving. When will demand return? In the most basic of economic terms, for example, airline fares are set based on a supply curve and a demand curve. Airlines usually have the lever of supply under their control, and it\u2019s generally understood that when they want to stimulate demand to fill capacity, they reduce fares. More people will travel if a ticket is $50 than if it is $100. The X factor right now is that many people are scared to travel because of hygiene concerns, lockdown guidance and quarantine rules.\u00a0 \u201cShort-term, aircraft will continue to be much less full and airlines will be motivated to price seats to get customers flying safely in a Covid-19 world,\u201d says Joe Leader, chief executive officer of APEX, a trade association whose members include airlines and their suppliers. \u201cAirlines have cut back their flights to absolute connectivity minimums and are losing money on the vast majority of remaining flights\u2026 Hopefully, the combination of increased Covid-19 safety measures alongside low prices will encourage a travel rebound.\u201d Paul Simmons, a senior airline executive with experience at numerous airlines worldwide including easyJet and Malaysia Airlines, suggests much will depend on what part low pricing can play as a tool to persuade people to travel. \u201cIt could be that airlines find their traditional lever of low pricing to drive bums on seats does not work as well as it used to. People may have higher concerns.\u201d The general view is that domestic travel will recover first, a view with which Peter Foster, CEO of Kazakhstan\u2019s national carrier Air Astana, agrees. \u201cInitial indications from our recently-restarted limited domestic flights are that there is pent-up demand for these routes. We believe that business, worker and student travel will recover well before leisure travel.\u201d IATA, an airline trade association, expects low demand when countries first start to travel again, despite some business travellers needing to fly and a desire for what\u2019s known as VFR \u2014\u00a0visiting friends and relatives \u2014 traffic as people miss their families. On the plus side for airlines, IATA notes that the biggest variable cost in aviation, fuel, will be low: as drivers in many places are noticing, there\u2019s oversupply in the petroleum industry keeping prices down. Will supply fall?  If there are major unknowns on the demand side, there are also evolving factors influencing pricing on the supply side. One of the starkest images for the airline industry has been the sight of line after line of jets parked on runways and put into storage at aircraft recycling \u2018boneyards\u2019. While older and less efficient planes will be retired, some of them years ahead of schedule, airline executive Paul Simmons points out that most of the planes taken out of fleets have been stored, not scrapped. \u201cThis is an important distinction,\u201d he says. Joe Leader from airline association APEX suggests that \u201cthere will be more than enough supply even with all of the early aircraft retirements\u201d. Certainly to start off with, demand will be low enough to be met by the aircraft that haven\u2019t been retired. Airbus and Boeing have both announced cuts to the numbers of new aircraft they\u2019re building every month, but as demand rises again, the aircraft manufacturers can increase production, airlines can extend the life of aircraft they\u2019re using, or older aircraft can be brought back into use from storage. It\u2019s already clear that the airline landscape, and indeed the names painted on the side of the aircraft, are likely to be forever changed. Some airlines have already filed for various forms of bankruptcy protection or indeed have simply gone under. This will, in many cases, lead to less competition \u2013 and the possibility of monopoly pricing, which tends not to favour consumers. Yet it\u2019s likely that regulators will come down hard on airlines seen to profiteer, while other carriers will seek to jump into monopoly markets where that is possible, or new entrants will arise. For passengers, that\u2019s likely to mean a fair amount of volatility in fares. \u201cAlthough some airlines will inevitably go out of business, others will scale up to fill the void,\u201d comments Simmons. \u201cThe \u2018rightsizing\u2019 of supply and demand may take time, however, leading to higher pricing in the medium term.\u201d No easy answers The watchword for aviation, as for so many industries looking to rebound from Covid-19, is going to be uncertainty. New waves of infection, or treatment breakthroughs, would both influence the future path. So too will political and regulatory responses, as well as the wider global economic fallout that is being forecast. Demand, crucially, is not rising evenly; different government restrictions \u00ad\u2013 especially quarantine periods on arrival for travellers from some nations \u2013\u00a0will have effects that are very complex to model, and will necessarily differ between nations or even within regions of the same nation. The US is an example of how perceptions and thus demand can vary across a nation. Scott DeAngelo, chief marketing officer of niche leisure carrier Allegiant Air, said on an earnings call that customer surveys revealed that \u201cin the Midwest and Mid Atlantic, the Upper West, I got to tell you they don\u2019t share the opinion that the evening news is putting out there\u201d around travel. Pictures over the US Memorial Day holiday weekend have shown leisure destinations in some parts of the country packed with partygoers. It seems likely that travel resumption \u201cbubbles\u201d between neighbouring countries and regions with acceptably low infection rates (where \u201cacceptably\u201d will also vary) will continue, and while these may stimulate demand travellers will also not want to be caught overseas if restrictions return swiftly. The question of whether any travel insurance would cover Covid-19-related issues is also crucial. Airlines also need to start flying for people to start buying tickets even in a reduced demand scenario, and we are only just starting to see a very limited number of airlines resuming very limited schedules. That all makes predicting the effects of the interlocking factors upon which airline pricing is based challenging. The demand side of the curve is particularly tricky for long-haul pricing, says Air Astana CEO Peter Foster, who nevertheless expects that the stronger long-haul airlines are likely to try to kickstart demand with lower fares. Short-haul carriers, meanwhile, may benefit from low oil prices, reduced aircraft prices that enable counter-cyclical orders and lower salaries due to surplus aviation workers. \u201cThe prognosis may well be lower airfares on short/medium haul routes for at least 18 months to two years,\u201d Foster expects. And while Covid-19 is unprecedented, he believes the past can offer indicators for future trends. \u201cAfter every major crisis of the last 20 years \u2013 the Asian financial crisis of 1998, 9/11, the global financial crisis \u2013 low-cost airlines have emerged faster and stronger because suppressed demand combined with depressed consumer spending power has driven people to them,\u201d he says. \u201cI doubt 2020/21 will be any different.\u201d Aviation journalist John Walton writes about airlines, aircraft and everything aeronautical.
