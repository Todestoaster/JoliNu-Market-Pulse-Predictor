            "title": "Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun to leave as firm faces safety crisis",
            "text": "Boeing boss Dave Calhoun will leave at the end of this year amid a deepening crisis over the firm's safety record. Boeing also said that the head of its commercial airlines division will retire immediately while its chairman will not stand for re-election.  The firm is under pressure after an unused door blew out of a Boeing 737 Max in January shortly after take-off. No-one was injured but the firm's safety and quality control standards came under renewed scrutiny. Mr Calhoun took on the chief executive role in early 2020 after the previous boss, Dennis Muilenburg, was ousted in the aftermath of one of the biggest scandals in Boeing's history. Within the space of five months, two brand new 737 Max planes had been lost in almost identical accidents that claimed the lives of 346 passengers and crew. A board member at the time, after being made boss Mr Calhoun promised to strengthen Boeing's \"safety culture\" and \"rebuild trust\". However, in January this year a disused emergency exit door blew off a new Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max shortly after take-off from Portland International Airport. An initial report from the US National Transportation Safety Board concluded that four bolts meant to attach the door securely to the aircraft had not been fitted. Boeing is facing a criminal investigation into the incident itself, as well as legal action from passengers aboard the plane. Many analysts said a change in Boeing's leadership was overdue.  \"A shake-up at the top is necessary,\" said Stewart Glickman, equity analyst at CFRA Research, adding that he believed the current crisis stemmed from problems in the firm's corporate culture that only fresh insight would be able to fix. \"I don't think you can change the culture with internal voices because I think this has been modus operandi for this company for too long.\" In a letter to staff on Monday, Mr Calhoun described the Alaska Airlines incident as a \"watershed moment\" for Boeing and said it had to respond with \"humility and complete transparency\". \"The eyes of the world are on us, and I know that we will come through this moment a better company,\" he said. Air safety campaigner Ed Pierson, a former senior manager at Boeing's 737 factory in Renton, Washington, said Mr Calhoun had had years to try to boost safety at the company. \"It's been one failure after the other,\" said Mr Pierson, who is now executive director at The Foundation for Aviation Safety.  \"The company deserves much better leadership and the people who get on these airplanes deserve much better leadership.\" The blowout had tested Boeing's relationships with its airline customers and regulators in Washington, reviving concerns that the company's corporate culture had focused on speed of production ahead of safety. The Federal Aviation Administration said earlier this month that a six-week audit of the 737 Max production process at Boeing and its supplier Spirit Aerosystems had found \"multiple instances where the companies failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements\". Another report into Boeing's safety culture by an expert panel found a \"disconnect\" between senior management and regular staff, as well as signs that staff were hesitant about reporting problems for fear of retaliation. After the two plane crashes in October 2018 and 2019, it was discovered that flawed flight control software caused the incidents - details of which Boeing was accused of deliberately concealing from regulators. The company agreed to pay $2.5bn (\u00a31.8bn) to settle fraud charges and admitted deception, though in later court hearings it formally pleaded not guilty. It subsequently faced widespread accusations that it had put profits ahead of passengers' lives. Mark Pegram, whose 25-year-old son Sam died when Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crashed in 2019, said Mr Calhoun had appeared to have been brought in to say what investors wanted to hear and \"not fix the cause of the problems that were making planes fall out of the sky\".  He said he was pleased by the change but disappointed it had taken so long. \"It's something we've been calling for for quite some time now,\" he said. The crisis at Boeing has caused wider disruption in the travel industry as the company, one of the world's two major jet-makers, slows its manufacturing lines to try to get a grip on the problems. Airlines, including Ryanair, have warned of higher ticket prices and more limited flight schedules as they face delayed aircraft deliveries. On Monday, Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said that the company \"welcomed\" Boeing's management changes, specifically the departure of Stan Deal who is leaving his role as head of the commercial airlines division immediately.  Mr O'Leary said: \"Stan Deal has done a great sales job for Boeing for many years but he is not the person to turnaround the operation in Seattle and that's where most of the problems have been in recent years.\" Scott Hamilton, managing director of Seattle-based aircraft and economics research firm Leeham Company, told the BBC's Today programme: \"I've never quite understood O'Leary's defence of Calhoun. \"I certainly understand his criticism of Stan Deal, now the former chief executive of Boeing commercial airplanes. but I've never understood his defence of Calhoun quite frankly.\" Mr Hamilton added: \"I think the rank and file [at Boeing] are happy to see the changes. The unknown, of course, is who is going to come in to replace Calhoun.\" Speculation has already started on who that might be but the pool of people with qualifications for such a job is small.  Air transport consultant John Strickland of JLS Consulting warned that the hard work for the company was still ahead. \"It's all very well to get rid of people but what are you going to do to keep steering the business,\" Mr Strickland said. \"This is much easier said than done.\" Shares in the company rose more than 1% after the changes were announced. Mr Deal will will be replaced as head of Boeing's commercial airlines division by Stephanie Pope who has spent the past three months working as Boeing's chief operating officer. Larry Kellner, the firm's chair will also leave and be replaced by Steve Mollenkopf, the former boss of Qualcomm, the chip-maker, who has been a board member at Boeing since 2020. He will lead the search for a new chief executive.",

            "title": "Boeing: How much trouble is the company in?",
            "text": "\"It's as if I'm watching a troubled child\" is how Captain Dennis Tajer describes flying a Boeing 737 Max. The lead spokesman of the Allied Pilots Association, the pilots union for American Airlines, insists he would never board an aircraft if it were not safe.  But he says he can no longer take the quality of the plane he's flying for granted. \"I'm at an alert status that I've never had to be in on a Boeing airplane,\" he says. \"Because I don't trust that they've followed the processes that have previously kept me safe on Boeing airplanes for over three decades.\" Executives at the aerospace giant's shiny new headquarters in Arlington, Virginia could be forgiven for feeling like they are under siege. Every day seems to bring more bad headlines for the company, which is coming under pressure from regulators and airlines, and has seen its reputation badly damaged. The trouble began in January, when a disused emergency exit door blew off a brand new Boeing 737 Max shortly after take-off from Portland International Airport. An initial report from the US National Transportation Safety Board concluded that four bolts meant to attach the door securely to the aircraft had not been fitted. Boeing is reportedly facing a criminal investigation into the incident itself, as well as legal action from passengers aboard the plane. But although no-one was seriously hurt, the affair had much wider repercussions. It cast a harsh spotlight on the aerospace giant's corporate culture and attitude to safety. Flight 1282: The Blowout Every passenger's worst nightmare: the terrifying moment a plane door rips away mid-air.  Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Five years ago Boeing faced one of the biggest scandals in its history, after two brand new 737 Max planes were lost in almost identical accidents that cost 346 lives. The cause was flawed flight control software, details of which it was accused of deliberately concealing from regulators.  The company agreed to pay $2.5bn (\u00a31.8bn) to settle fraud charges, and admitted deception, though in later court hearings it formally pleaded not guilty. It subsequently faced widespread accusations that it had put profits ahead of passengers' lives.  It reaffirmed its commitment to safety, and in early 2020 its newly appointed chief executive Dave Calhoun promised it could \"do better. Much better.\" Yet the scrutiny that followed the incident in January this year has called that commitment into question. Addressing those concerns, Mr Calhoun said: \"We will go slow, we will not rush the system and we will take our time to do it right.\" Earlier this month the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, said that a six-week audit of the 737 Max production process at Boeing and its supplier Spirit Aerosystems had found \"multiple instances where the companies failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements\". The findings came shortly after another report into Boeing's safety culture by an expert panel found a \"disconnect\" between senior management and regular staff, as well as signs that staff were hesitant about reporting problems for fear of retaliation. Adam Dickson, a former senior manager at Boeing who once worked on the 737 Max programme, agrees there is a gulf between executives and workers on the factory floor. \"The culture at Boeing has been toxic to trust for over a decade now,\" he says. \"You can add safety steps, you can add procedures. But the fundamental issue of distrust makes those changes almost ineffective\", he claims. Meanwhile, further evidence of how production problems could endanger safety emerged this week.  The FAA warned that improperly installed wiring bundles on 737 Max planes could become damaged, leading to controls on the wings deploying unexpectedly, and making the aircraft start to roll. If not addressed, it said, this \"could result in loss of control of the airplane\". Hundreds of planes already in service will have to be checked as a result.  Boeing said based on the FAA audit it was continuing \"to implement immediate changes and develop a comprehensive action plan to strengthen safety and quality, and build the confidence of our customers and their passengers.\" But concerns about Boeing's production standards are far from new. Whistleblower John Barnett, who was found dead last weekend, had worked at Boeing's factory in South Carolina from 2010 until his retirement in 2017. A quality manager on the 787 Dreamliner programme, he had claimed the rush to build planes as quickly as possible in order to maximise profits had led to unsafe practices. Among a number of allegations, he told the BBC that in some cases under-pressure workers had deliberately fitted substandard parts to planes on the production line. Boeing denied his claims. But his untimely death, which occurred between legal hearings in a lawsuit against the company, has focused new attention on them. The crisis at the aerospace giant is now causing problems for airlines. Ryanair has warned that delays to new aircraft deliveries will push up prices for passengers in Europe this summer. US carrier Southwest plans to cut its capacity this year because it can't get hold of the planes it needs. Some carriers may try to obtain Airbus models to replace the lost Boeings. But a wholesale transfer of orders from the American manufacturer to the European is simply impractical. Both have very full order books. Airbus has a backlog of more than 8,000 planes and Boeing more than 6,000.  Airlines are already having to wait longer than they would like for new aircraft. Airbus has had its own supply chain problems, leading to late deliveries.  There is a potential third player. The Chinese manufacturer Comac has developed the C919, a plane designed to compete with the 737 Max and the A320 neo. But that programme is still in its infancy. By 2028 it will be producing only 150 aircraft a year. In other words, the market needs Boeing to be healthy, and to overcome its current problems quickly. So can that happen? According to Ed Pierson, executive director at the Foundation for Aviation Safety, the issues involved are complex, but fixable. Himself a former Boeing whistleblower, he has spent years lobbying regulators to take a firm approach to the company. \"Boeing, their suppliers, airlines, and government agencies are capable of overcoming these challenges, but the first step in fixing these problems is being honest,\" he says \"They need to admit these problems exist and stop trying to spin the truth. The more they spin, the longer it takes to solve the problems and the greater the risk.\" Boeing says that over the last several years, it has \"never hesitated to slow down, to halt production, or to stop deliveries to take the time we need to get things right\".  It added that it has launched a \"Speak Up\" programme encouraging staff to raise issues that need to be addressed.",

            "title": "United Airlines flight 433 lands safely without panel in Oregon",
            "text": "A Boeing plane landed without one of its fuselage panels at an airport in the US state of Oregon on Friday, says United Airlines.  A spokesperson said United flight 433, from San Francisco, arrived at the Rogue Valley International Airport in Medford, Oregon, at about 11:30 (18:30 GMT) on Friday. The 25-year-old Boeing 737-800 was carrying 139 passengers and 6 crew. No-one was injured - the missing panel went unnoticed during the flight. Boeing is under fierce scrutiny after a series of high-profile safety incidents. Amber Judd, a senior official at Rogue Valley International Medford Airport, said the plane landed safely and the external panel was only discovered missing during a post-flight inspection. \"We'll conduct a thorough examination of the plane and perform all the needed repairs before it returns to service,\" she said. An investigation would be carried out \"to better better understand how this damage occurred\", she added. The missing panel was next to the landing gear, on the underside of the aircraft, according to images of the aircraft on social media. All outgoing and incoming flights were paused at the airport to search for debris, none was found.  The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was investigating how the panel came apart. Boeing came under renewed scrutiny after a January incident involving a Boeing 737 Max 9 - part of a new range of planes to succeed older 737s - saw an unused cabin door blow out a few minutes after take-off in January. The incident on board Alaska Airlines flight 1282 left a gaping hole in the side of the plane and forced an emergency landing. Testifying before US lawmakers on 7 February after the Alaska Airlines blowout incident, the head of the FAA, Mike Whitaker, said inspections of 737 Max aircraft had shown that \"the quality system issues at Boeing were unacceptable and require further scrutiny\". Initial findings of a probe found that four key bolts that were meant to lock the unused door to the fuselage appeared to be missing. Mr Whitaker said that Boeing would be held accountable for any future failure or refusal to comply with the FAA.  Earlier this month, fumes detected in the cabin of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737-800 bound for Phoenix forced pilots to return to Portland airport. On Monday, at least 50 people were injured after a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner flying from Australia to New Zealand suddenly dropped without warning, leaving passengers who were not wearing seatbelts tossed into aisles and flung into the ceiling. In response to that incident, Boeing has told airlines that pilots need to check their seats - after reports said a flight attendant accidentally hit a switch in the cockpit which pushed the pilot's seat forward into the controls - forcing the plane's nose down. Despite the reported incidents, commercial aviation remains one of the safest ways to travel, experts and regulators say.

            "text": "A former Boeing employee known for raising concerns about the firm's production standards has been found dead in the US.  John Barnett worked for Boeing for more than 30 years before retiring in 2017. In the days before his death, he had been giving evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit against the company.  Boeing said it was saddened to hear of Mr Barnett's passing. The Charleston County coroner confirmed his death to the BBC on Monday.  It said the 62-year-old had died from a \"self-inflicted\" wound on 9 March and police were investigating.  Mr Barnett had worked for the US plane giant for three decades, until his retirement in 2017 on health grounds.  From 2010, he was employed as a quality manager at the North Charleston plant. The facility builds the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes.  In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line.  He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied. He later told the BBC that workers had failed to follow procedures intended to track components through the factory, allowing defective components to go missing.  He said in some cases, sub-standard parts had even been removed from scrap bins and fitted to planes that were being built to prevent delays on the production line. He also claimed that tests on emergency oxygen systems due to be fitted to the 787 showed a failure rate of 25%, meaning that one in four could fail to deploy in a real-life emergency. Mr Barnett said he had alerted managers to his concerns, but no action had been taken.  Boeing denied his assertions. However, a 2017 review by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), did uphold some of Mr Barnett's concerns. It established that the location of at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts in the factory was unknown, and that they were considered lost. Boeing was ordered to take remedial action. On the oxygen cylinders issue, the company said that in 2017 it had \"identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly\". But it denied that any of them were actually fitted on aircraft. After retiring, he embarked on a long-running legal action against the company.  He accused it of denigrating his character and hampering his career because of the issues he pointed out - charges rejected by Boeing. At the time of his death, Mr Barnett had been in Charleston for legal interviews linked to that case. Last week, he gave a formal deposition in which he was questioned by Boeing's lawyers, before being cross-examined by his own counsel. He had been due to undergo further questioning on Saturday. When he did not appear, enquiries were made at his hotel.  He was subsequently found dead in his truck in the hotel car park.  Speaking to the BBC, his lawyer described his death as \"tragic\".  In a statement Boeing said: \"We are saddened by Mr. Barnett's passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.\" His death comes at a time when production standards at both Boeing and its key supplier Spirit Aerosystems are under intense scrutiny. This follows an incident in early January when an unused emergency exit door blew off a brand-new Boeing 737 Max shortly after take-off from Portland International Airport. A preliminary report from the US National Transportation Safety Board suggested that four key bolts, designed to hold the door securely in place, were not fitted. Last week, the FAA said a six-week audit of the company had found \"multiple instances where the company allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements\".",

            "text": "Boeing has told airlines operating 787 Dreamliners that pilots need to check their seats as an investigation into an incident on a Latam flight continues. It comes after 50 people were hurt this week when a 787 dropped suddenly during a Latam Airlines flight. The Wall Street Journal reported that a flight attendant accidentally hit a switch on the pilot's seat, which pushed the pilot into the controls, forcing down the plane's nose. Latam is supporting investigations. During the incident people were thrown against the roof of the plane, which was travelling from Australia to New Zealand. Passenger Brian Jokat said at the time that a number of people suffered head injuries. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Jokat revealed that people had hit the ceiling with such force \"some of the roof panels were broken\". The person next to him, he added, appeared to be \"glued to the ceiling\". \"I did think for a split second: 'This is it',\" he said. Emergency services later said one person was in a serious condition. Boeing said: \"The investigation of Flight LA800 is ongoing and we defer to the investigation authorities on any potential findings.\" \"We have taken the precautionary measure of reminding 787 operators of a service bulletin issued in 2017 which included instructions for inspecting and maintaining switches on flight deck seats.\" It recommended that operators perform an inspection of the switches \"at the next maintenance opportunity\". Chilean-Brazilian carrier Latam Airlines said it \"continues to work in coordination with the authorities in order to support the ongoing investigation\". The aircraft was scheduled to fly on from Auckland to Santiago, the capital of Chile. The departure was cancelled and a new flight scheduled for Tuesday. The incident comes after a door panel came off a Boeing plane in January this year, with a report in February finding bolts meant to secure the panel were missing. And this week, a former Boeing employee known for raising concerns about the firm's production standards was found dead in the US.",

            "text": "Lawyers for the Boeing employee-turned-whistleblower found dead by apparent suicide have hailed him as \"a brave, honest man of the highest integrity\". Authorities are currently investigating the death of John Barnett, from what appeared to be a self-inflicted wound. Mr Barnett retired after working more than 30 years at Boeing in 2017. He was giving evidence in a lawsuit against the company before his death. Two of his attorneys called on police to fully investigate how he had died. \"John was in the midst of a deposition in his whistleblower retaliation case, which finally was nearing the end,\" Robert Turkewitz and Brian Knowles said in a statement to the BBC. \"He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on. We didn't see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it.\" Calling on officials in Charleston, South Carolina to provide more information about what happened, they wrote: \"No detail can be left unturned.\" Mr Turkewitz and Mr Knowles added that Mr Barnett was somebody who \"cared dearly\" about his family, his friends and Boeing, from its pilots to its customers. From 2010 until his retirement on health grounds, Mr Barnett worked as a quality manager at the North Charleston plant making the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes. In that job, he \"learned of and exposed very serious safety problems with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and was retaliated against and subjected to a hostile work environment\", his lawyers said. After retiring, he embarked on a long-running legal action against the company. He accused it of denigrating his character and hampering his career because of the issues he pointed out - charges rejected by Boeing. At the time of his death, Mr Barnett had been in Charleston for legal interviews linked to that case and he gave a formal deposition last week in which he was questioned by Boeing's lawyers, before being cross-examined by his own counsel. He had been due to undergo further questioning on Saturday. When he did not appear, enquiries were made at his hotel. He was subsequently found dead in his truck in the hotel car park. Taking on his long-time employer had caused Mr Barnett to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and his health had been in decline, his brother told US media.  \"He was suffering from PTSD and anxiety attacks as a result of being subjected to the hostile work environment at Boeing, which we believe led to his death,\" Rodney Barnett said. Mr Barnett added that his brother \"was looking forward to having his day in court and hoped that it would force Boeing to change its culture\". The quality manager was known for raising concerns about the US plane giant's production standards, telling the BBC in 2019 that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He later told the BBC that workers had failed to follow procedures intended to track components through the factory, allowing defective components to go missing.

            "text": "One of the UK's biggest flight simulator businesses has closed blaming a lockdown voucher sales surge. Virtual Aerospace Limited, based in Stockport, said a \"huge backlog\" of 2,500 vouchers bought during the pandemic had been a factor in its demise.  The company has entered liquidation and shut all branches, including its Greater Manchester headquarters.  Customers with vouchers will have their details passed to liquidators.  Virtual Aerospace, which was set up in 2011, operated six simulators across its main Stockport site and two other locations in West Sussex and Northamptonshire. More than 40 flight instructors were employed at the business, which gave visitors the chance to replicate flying in popular planes including a Vulcan bomber and World War Two Spitfire. Demand on the operation caused by customers buying the vouchers to support the business during its 15-month pandemic closure \"massively affected new sales\", a statement on its website said. The statement added staff had \"tried everything\" to reduce the backlog and \"keep us alive\". The company ceased trading on 23 March on their website. David Waddington, from Burnley, who was due to use the Spitfire simulator, said he only found out about the liquidation on the morning he was supposed to visit.  Mr Waddington, 67, said: \"I went to check my emails before we set off and found two emails, one from 23 March saying it had closed. \"It'll probably be six months before I get any of the \u00a3100 back, and then it'll only be a percentage.\" The award-winning flight simulator firm flew more than 50,000 customers over an 11-year-period. It said it accepted customers would be \"mad\" following the news. The firm said despite \"thousands\" of hours of good will from engineers, pilots and the VA team, it \"was not enough to fend off\" the impact. \"We know many of you will be mad at us and that you invested in us in good faith and we feel awful and cannot apologise enough to anybody that has lost money in this situation,\" the statement read. Virtual Aerospace Ltd appointed Andrew Ryder from insolvency specialist JT Maxwell Limited on 13 February. Liquidators are now in the process of closing the premises, auctioning assets to pay outstanding creditors, and will be in touch with customers \"in due course\". The business telephone is directing customers to an email and its website appears to only show the statement online. Why not follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram?

            "text": "Two planes clipped each other at Heathrow Airport, causing minor damage to both aircraft. There were no injuries in the incident, which involved a British Airways plane with 121 passengers on board and a Virgin Atlantic aircraft. Virgin Atlantic said its empty Boeing 787-9 was being towed from the stand at Terminal 3 when it happened. The airline added that the plane had just landed and was being transported to a different part of the airfield. One of the wings of the plane being towed clipped the other aircraft. The passengers on the British Airways flight were scheduled to depart to Accra, Ghana, at 12:40 BST. British Airways said it provided an alternative aircraft for them, which was rescheduled to take off at 18:00. Virgin Atlantic said it was investigating and that maintenance checks were being made on its aircraft, which has been taken out of service. The tow movement was provided by a ground-handling company under contract by Virgin Atlantic, it said. A Heathrow spokesperson said: \"We are working alongside emergency services and our airline partners in response to an incident involving two aircraft on the ground earlier today.\" The spokesperson added: \"At present, no passenger injuries have been reported and we do not anticipate there to be any ongoing impact to airport operations.\" Emergency services attended the scene as a precautionary measure. The Met Police said it was supporting the airport authorities and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch with an investigation into the circumstances.

            "text": "When India's Tata Group bought the country's national airline, it was welcomed as something of a miracle.  Air India had been mired in debt and under-funded state management for decades. No-one wanted even a piece of the iconic but loss-making carrier. But a deal was struck in 2021, just as the world was emerging from the pandemic - and airlines were betting big on revenge travel once borders reopened. They were right. The rebound is well and truly under way and air travel is off to a roaring start in 2024. There have been warnings of slower growth in the US, where spending is expected to plateau after a post-pandemic spike. But it is a different story on the other side of the world in Asia. \"If we look at the size of the opportunity in India, it's already the world's most populous country,\" Air India's chief executive Campbell Wilson told the BBC at a recent aviation event in Singapore. \"It has the geographic advantage... connecting regions of the world together. And it is a hugely underserved market.\" By 2042, India's domestic aviation market is expected to be five times the size it was in 2019, with Indians taking around 685 million trips every year, according to plane maker Airbus. That would make the South Asian nation one of the world's fastest-growing civil aviation markets, and third after China and the United States.  It is not just India. By the middle of the century, Indonesia, which now ranks 13th globally in passenger numbers, is predicted to jump to the fourth spot, analysts say. Air travel is also expected to boom in the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam in the coming decades. They are all emerging economies with young, growing populations that can afford to spend on travel. And it is showing: global air traffic jumped by 16% over the last year. But in Asia, the increase was almost twice as much, according to industry figures. Governments in these places are also investing in infrastructure to improve connectivity, which is essential in vast archipelagos like Indonesia and the Philippines. China, of course, is an obvious market - despite its currently sluggish economy, its travellers have emerged from zero-Covid rules to return to holidaying. Beijing is now offering visa-free travel to citizens of certain countries and some nations, like Thailand and Singapore, are reciprocating. \"We are pleased that people are beginning to travel out of China. It is probably one of the last countries to come back big in travel,\" says Glenn Fogel, chief executive of online travel agency Booking.com. But airlines are looking for alternative markets because of China's slowing economy, the uncertainty of doing business there and a fall in consumer spending. Enter the Philippines. \"Asia is a very exciting place to be - the Philippines is one of the most exciting places to be. Great opportunity there,\" says Michael Szucs, chief executive of the Philippine budget carrier Cebu Pacific.  The airline struggled through the pandemic without government support. And like many competitors around the world, it is also facing groundings over faulty Pratt & Whitney engines.  But it has seen a revival in the last two years, expanding and cornering more than half of its domestic market. A new Philippine government is also helping - it is privatising the international airport in Manila and plans to add runways throughout the archipelago to receive larger and more aircraft. Mr Szucs has high hopes for the country of around 115 million people, where per capita spending is rising: \"We've got an increasingly educated population that is relatively young, it's growing, with an increasing propensity to travel.\" India, on the other hand, is a trickier market to conquer. Air India faces a stiff domestic rival in Indigo, and a daunting challenge in matching Emirates and Qatar Airways, which regularly rank among the world's best airlines. But the successful salt-to-software conglomerate Tata has started to turn the ailing carrier around. The company has already spent millions of dollars investing in new planes, new branding and restructuring old and inefficient systems. Now it wants to consolidate its five airlines - three Air India subsidiaries, and two joint ventures, Air Asia India and Vistara (with Singapore Airlines). The goal: a highly regarded airline for international flyers, and a reliable low-cost option for domestic passengers. Mr Wilson hopes to restore Air India's glory - it was India's first airline, started by the Tatas in the 1930s and rebranded as Air India and nationalised in the 1950s. He believes winning the international market is key but will need \"connecting more cities around the world nonstop with India\" - and that will involve starting more routes and, of course, buying more aircraft. The company has already gone on a buying spree. It ordered more than 200 Boeing Max 8 and Max 10s in one of the largest airline deals in aviation history. But the Max family of planes is under scrutiny since a door plug blew off a 737 Max 9 plane mid-flight in the US, sparking concerns about the already delayed Max 10 model. This was after two deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019 because of flawed flight control software. The crisis at Boeing over its safety record has also seen the resignation of its chief executive Dave Calhoun.  \"When we have concerns, we raise it at the highest levels, including with Boeing,\" Mr Campbell said.  Mr Wilson sees Air India's future in turning India into a global transit hub, much like Dubai or Singapore. That might be a challenge given that some long-haul routes, especially to Europe, are yet to be reinstated after the pandemic.Meanwhile, travellers in these countries are choosing to fly within East and South East Asia, driving up air traffic in the region. But that could also be an opportunity for Air India, and for Delhi given that some South East Asian capitals are lagging behind other international aviation hubs like Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai. The industry, however, is upbeat because the pandemic is over, people are flying again and economies are bouncing back. \"The fact is people like to travel,\" Mr Fogel said. \"As long as economies are growing, we know that travel is going to grow a little bit faster. And our job is to try and get a bigger part of that growing pie.\"",

            "text": "Airbus has confirmed that it could buy parts of the Spirit Aerosystems business.  Spirit has a major operation in Northern Ireland, which manufactures the wings for the Airbus A220.  It is one of Northern Ireland's largest and most important manufacturing businesses with more than 3,000 employees. Earlier this month Airbus's rival Boeing confirmed it had begun talks aimed at buying Spirit. However it is unlikely that Boeing would want to keep the parts of the business which supply Airbus. In an interview with CNBC, Airbus's chief financial officer confirmed it may buy some Spirit assets. \"In light of the situation today where Boeing has potentially the interest to take over Spirit, we could also imagine that some of the work packages could find their way to Airbus and we take them over,\" said Thomas Toepfer. \"But that quite frankly is a discussion that's in the very, very early stages,\" he added. \"It's very important for us that we have a stable relationship with Spirit, over the last number of months we've worked with them to support their performance.\" Spirit has been in Northern Ireland since 2019 when it bought Bombardier's operations, ending a long period of uncertainty for the workforce. However the ownership of the Belfast operation is now in question again because of problems in Spirit's US business. Spirit began life as a spin-off from Boeing in 2005 and remains a key Boeing supplier, particularly for the Boeing 737. Some of its work for Boeing has suffered from delays and quality issues, which has exacerbated problems at Boeing.",

            "title": "Alaskan Airlines flight 1282: FBI probes mid-air blowout on January flight",
            "text": "The FBI is investigating a January Alaska Airlines flight, where a door plug on the aircraft, a Boeing 737 Max 9, blew out mid-air.  A criminal probe was confirmed by the FBI in a letter sent to those aboard the plane, identifying them as \"victims\".  None of the 177 passengers and crew were killed, but some were injured. A group has since sued Alaska Airlines for \"serious emotional distress, fear and anxiety\".  The FBI letters, sent to passengers on 19 March by a victim specialist within the FBI's Seattle Division, said that the criminal investigation may be \"lengthy\". They added that updates on the probe's progress could not be shared at this time. The letters confirm early media reports that the Department of Justice (DOJ) had launched a criminal investigation into the Boeing jetliner blowout, which occurred on a 5 January flight from Portland, Oregon to Ontario, California. Sources familiar with the investigation told the BBC's US news partner CBS in early March that the probe will look into whether Boeing violated an agreement it entered with the Justice Department in 2021, following two crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft.  More than 300 people died in the two crashes of Boeing's Max planes in 2018 and 2019. Boeing has not commented on the ongoing criminal probe. In a statement shared with media after news of the DOJ investigation emerged, Alaska Airlines said a federal probe is normal \"in an event like this\". \"We are fully cooperating and do not believe we are a target of the investigation,\" said the airline. The Alaska Airlines flight had to make an emergency landing in Portland after an outer section of the plane fell off shortly after take-off.  The loss of that section caused an uncontrolled decompression inside the aircraft, where passengers say they had to \"hold on for dear life\".  One passenger, Cuong Tran, told the BBC that his seat belt saved him as his phone, socks and shoes were ripped off 16,000ft above ground.  Mr Tran, who was sitting next to his friend one row behind the section which blew out, said he suffered injuries including a laceration to his leg.  Images shared online - and later by the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) - showed a wide hole in the side of the Boeing 737-9 Max aircraft, with oxygen masks dangling from the ceiling. The missing section of the plane was later found in the back garden of a Portland school teacher's home.  In a preliminary investigation US regulators found four critical bolts - meant to hold the so-called door plug in place - were missing from the flight. Shortly after the incident, officials from the NTSB said that Boeing had also placed restrictions on the plane involved in the incident days before it took off.  The jet had been prevented from making long-haul flights over water, said NTSB chief Jennifer Homendy, after pilots reported pressurisation warning lights on three previous flights made on that specific plane. The decision to restrict lengthy flights over water was so that the plane \"could return very quickly to an airport\" in the event the warnings happened again, she said. ",

            "text": "India and China must urgently address their border disputes to improve bilateral relations, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said. The two countries share an ill-defined, 3,440km (2,100-mile)-long border in the Himalayas, which has been a source of tension for decades. Mr Modi made the comment during a rare interview with Newsweek magazine. Opposition parties have often accused him of staying silent on reported Chinese incursions along the border. In his almost 10 years in office, Mr Modi has given just a handful of interviews to the press and has not addressed a single news conference in India. But just days before voting starts in India's general election, the prime minister has given interviews to three news outlets - Thanthi TV and the Assam Tribune in India, and the American magazine Newsweek.  In the latest interview, Mr Modi didn't directly comment on the opposition parties' allegations that China had captured large parts of Indian territory. He instead talked about the importance of India's relations with China.  He said peaceful relations between the two countries were important for the entire region and the world. \"I hope and believe that through positive and constructive bilateral engagement at the diplomatic and military levels, we will be able to restore and sustain peace and tranquillity at our borders. \"It is my belief that we need to urgently address the prolonged situation on our borders so that the abnormality in our bilateral interactions can be put behind us,\" he said.  He also commented on India competing with China as a hub for manufacturing. In the recent past, global giants like Apple, Boeing and Tesla have reportedly been looking to either set up manufacturing plants in India or increase sourcing from the country. \"India, as a democratic polity and global economic growth engine, is a natural choice for those looking to diversify their supply chains,\" Mr Modi said.   Mr Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah have previously denied that China had captured any Indian territory.  India's main opposition Congress party, however, says that the government makes it harder for India to deal with China's \"illegal encroachments\" each time it \"gives a clean chit\" to its neighbour. Tensions between the two countries escalated in 2020 when Indian and Chinese troops clashed at the border near the Tawang sector of Arunachal Pradesh state, the eastern tip of India.  Called the Galwan Valley battle - it was fought with sticks and clubs, not guns - and was the first fatal confrontation between the two sides since 1975. The clashes left at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead. Since then, there have been several minor clashes between troops even as officials on both sides work towards a de-escalation plan. Mr Modi's Newsweek interview, published on Wednesday, comes almost a week before India's general election is due to get under way. Strategists and opinion polls have predicted a third consecutive term for Mr Modi. The interaction was in the form of a written interview, followed by a \"90-minute conversation\" with Mr Modi at his official residence, according to the magazine. Mr Modi addressed other topics, including allegations of discrimination against minorities by his government. Rights groups say that they often face discrimination and attacks, and have been forced to live as \"second-class\" citizens under Mr Modi's rule - an allegation the BJP denies. In the past 10 years, a number of cases involving violence against Muslims by right-wing groups have been reported in India.  He said \"these are usual tropes of some people who don't bother to meet people outside their bubbles\" and added that minorities of all religions were thriving happily in India. He also addressed allegations of his government clamping down on press freedoms.  \"There are a few people in India and in the West who have lost [connection with] the people of India - their thought processes, feelings and aspirations. These people also tend to live in their own echo chamber of alternate realities. They conflate their own dissonance with the people with dubious claims of diminishing media freedom.\" In the past two years, a number of media houses, including the BBC, have been raided by federal agencies. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders last year placed India at 161 out of 180 countries in their World Press Freedom Index report. Several opposition leaders have also been either questioned or arrested on corruption charges they deny.",

            "text": "A major Indian airline is scaling back operations this month amid widespread flight cancellations and delays due to unavailability of its pilots. Since 31 March, Vistara has seen nearly 150 flight cancellations and 200 flight delays. Media reports said the disruption was caused by pilots going on mass sick leave to protest against changes post the airline's merger with Air India. Vistara says it is looking into better work-life balance for its pilots. A Vistara official told the BBC the airline was \"scaling back its network temporarily\" and that customers would be given refunds for cancelled flights. According to The Hindu newspaper, at meeting on Wednesday, Vistara CEO Vinod Kannan apologised to pilots for \"taxing schedules\" and sought their \"support\" in resolving concerns. Mr Kannan also said that flight cancellations would continue until the end of the month to create a pilot buffer. The Tata Group, which holds the majority stake in Vistara, bought debt-ridden Air India - formerly India's national carrier - from the government for $2.2bn (\u00a31.8bn) in 2021. It is now in the process of consolidating its airline business as it merges its various entities. A joint venture between Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, Vistara will invest $250 million for a 25.1% stake in the combined entity once the merger is complete. Reports over the past few days say pilots at Vistara are unhappy with the new pay structure and work hours offered as part of the merger process.  Pilots have also complained of haphazard rostering practices and raised concerns about their career prospects after the merger which is expected to be completed next year. According to an NDTV report, pilots have been falling ill with increasing frequency, \"flying at the limits of the maximum duty limitations\". This had led to concerns about their health and safety. A Vistara official told the BBC that the airline acknowledged their \"rosters had been utilised to the maximum\" and that it was working to modify the roster to ensure a \"better work-life balance\" for its pilots. The airline, however, said there had been no significant rise in pilots reporting sick and attributed the delay in flights in March also to other factors such as \"bird hits, planned maintenance, weather disruptions and congestion\".",

Speaking to the BBC, Mr Tran, 40, said it happened soon after take-off when he would usually be getting ready to doze off.  \"The captain said we had passed 10,000 feet. Then the hole blew out on us and I remember my body getting lifted up. Then my whole lower body got sucked down by the howling wind.\" Mr Tran said the decompression lasted around 10 or 20 seconds and he described looking around at other passengers who could not believe what was happening. \"It was probably the first time in my life I had a feeling of no control over everything. I was in disbelief over the whole situation,\" said Mr Tran. Flight 1282: The Blowout Every passenger's worst nightmare: the terrifying moment a plane door rips away mid-air.  Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) \"That feeling of no control is pretty terrifying. The suction was so strong and I was hanging on for dear life. Both my shoes ended up getting sucked out - I had my shoe on pretty tight too.  \"My phone which was in my hand disappeared.\" The plane was able to make its emergency landing back to Portland International Airport and passengers were seen to by emergency services. Mr Tran added: \"They said it took 30 minutes, but it felt like a lot longer.  \"I had no phone so had no idea of the time, so I was just sat there staring into the hole this whole time and hoped it wouldn't get any more damage.  \"That was the scariest moment - the waiting. My body is recovering, but there is a big scar in my leg. I don't know if it going to be gone any time.\" Mr Tran is one of several passengers suing Alaska Airlines, Boeing and manufacturer Spirit Aerosystems, claiming the event left them with physical injuries and \"serious emotional distress, fear, and anxiety\". The plaintiffs are seeking punitive, compensatory and general damages, although the lawsuit does not specify an amount. Spirit Aerosystems, Boeing and Alaska Airlines said it would not comment on pending litigation. Attorney Timothy A Loranger told the BBC the litigation process could take \"a couple of years\" as there are a lot of people involved. \"His [Mr Tran] leg was almost sucked out of the airplane if it wasn't for his seatbelt,\" Mr Loranger said. \"It is just terrifying.\" This lawsuit was filed in King County Superior Court, Washington, and is separate to another set of passengers who are suing Alaska Airlines and Boeing for $1bn - claiming negligence. Alaska Airlines initially grounded its 737 MAX 9 fleet of 65 aircraft. This was later followed by an Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) order for all airlines to ground the Boeing model - approximately 171 worldwide. Aviation giant Boeing has been under heavy regulatory scrutiny with probes into the company's safety and quality standards in its production process. On Wednesday, the NTSB said it will hold a two-day investigative hearing on the incident at the start of August. But NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said Boeing has been unable to produce key information about work performed on the Alaska Airlines plane before the mid-air scare. In a letter addressed to leaders of the Senate, Homendy said the door plug which failed had been opened so rivet repair work could be done in September last year. The work took place at Boeing's Renton, Washington, facility before delivery to Alaska Airlines on 31 October 2023. \"To date, we still do not know who performed the work to open, reinstall, and close the door plug on the accident aircraft,\" Homendy said. \"The absence of those records will complicate the NTSB's investigation moving forward.\"",

            "text": "Army Air Corps attack helicopters used in Afghanistan and Libya have made their last operational flight more than 20 years after taking to the skies. Apache Mark 1s of 656 Squadron landed at Wattisham Flying Station in Suffolk on Monday after a farewell tour. Wattisham-based units had flown the helicopter, which is being replaced by the Apache AH-64E, on operations in Afghanistan and Libya. Prince Harry flew Apaches from Wattisham during tours in the Army. Locations with links to the Mark 1 had featured on the farewell flight.  An Army spokesman said flypast sites included Colchester, Essex, where troops from 16 Air Assault Brigade are based. He said the Mark 1, which entered service in 2001, had \"proved itself\" as a \"battle-winning asset\". The Army said in October that the Apache AH-64E had passed its battlefield test after an exercise. Manoeuvres involved 8,000 troops working out of 22 locations across south-west England, the West Midlands and Wales. Simulated strike missions had been completed in Northumberland and Kent - and 3 Regiment Army Air Corps units based at Wattisham had tested the maintenance and operation of the AH-64E. One senior officer called the Boeing-built AH-64E \"revolutionary\". The Army spokesman added: \"The AH-64E features improved flying performance and new sensors and communications systems that vastly improve its ability to find and strike the enemy on the battlefield.\" BBC Radio Suffolk's aviation expert, Roger Smith, said the AH-64E looked similar to the Mark 1. But he said the new helicopter was a \"lot different\" internally and had \"absolutely tremendous\" capability. He told BBC Radio Suffolk: \"It's like going from an Amiga 500 to the latest Apple Mac or Microsoft.\" Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

            "title": "United Airlines addresses air travel safety fears",
            "text": "The head of United Airlines is seeking to directly reassure travellers that his company's flights are safe, after recent mishaps have spooked customers. In a letter to the airline's millions of passengers, chief executive Scott Kirby said \"safety is our highest priority\". Last week, a panel from a plane's body fell off mid-flight and earlier this month a plane engine caught fire. United is reviewing what happened, Mr Kirby wrote. \"I want you to know that these incidents have our attention and have sharpened our focus,\" wrote Mr Kirby, adding that safety is at the centre of \"everything we do\".  He said the company was already planning to expand training for pilots and new maintenance technicians and would increase resources to manage its network of suppliers. United carried a record 165 million passengers on its planes last year and brought in $2.6 bn (\u00a32 bn). The company is counting on strong demand for travel to continue. Mr Kirby said the incidents - which also included a plane that lost a tire after take-off, among others - were all \"unrelated\". But it comes amid elevated attention on air travel incidents large and small.  In January, an emergency exit door on a nearly brand new Boeing plane blew off in mid-air, reviving wider questions about the quality of the jets produced by the company, one of the world's two major jet-makers. That was on Alaska Airlines. The Federal Aviation Administration said, as is customary, it was investigating the United incident involving the missing panel, which occurred on a 25-year-old plane.  Its absence was discovered after landing and pictures spread widely on social media.  United attributed the fire on the other plane, which made a safe emergency landing, to an \"engine issue\".  The FAA is also reviewing a number of other incidents. Fatalities and accidents on US commercial flights remain extremely rare, according to US government statistics.  ",

            "title": "US salaries are surging for fully in-office jobs",
            "text": "Bosses want their workers back on-site on a more permanent basis. They're willing to pay a premium to do so. While many jobs still offer hybrid- or remote-working patterns, more bosses are mandating their employees to return to the office on a\u00a0full-time basis. Boeing, UPS and JPMorgan Chase are among the large corporations that have enforced in-person attendance five days a week. But for some of these companies, getting workers fully back on-site comes with a high price tag. This is particularly the case in the US, which has seen the most dramatic shift to flexible working \u2013 by January 2024, around 29% of all paid workdays were still worked from home. \"Employers who cannot compete on flexibility will have to compete more aggressively on pay,\" says Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, based in California.\u00a0 The result is that US wages for fully in-office roles are surging. According to ZipRecruiter data, seen by the BBC, companies were offering on average $82,037 (\u00a364,562) for fully in-person roles by March 2024 \u2013 an increase of more than 33% versus 2023 ($59,085; \u00a346,499). The trend is cross-sector: compared to hybrid ($59,992; \u00a347,211) and fully remote ($75,327; \u00a364,320) roles, workers appear to be more likely to increase their salaries by returning to pre-pandemic office schedules.\u00a0 Part of this is compensating for the loss of flexibility that workers have prioritised for the past few years \u2013 the greater the push to relinquish that autonomy, the more employers have to offer to compensate. The ZipRecruiter data shows that workers who swapped from fully remote to fully in-office set-ups in the US through 2023 received a 29.2% pay bump \u2013 nearly double that of those moving the other way. \"The conclusion is that people demand higher pay increases for fully in-office jobs,\" says\u00a0Pollak. \"An employer offering flexibility can negotiate the overall compensation package with non-monetary incentives, while an employer wanting teams on-site five days a week can only offer financial terms \u2013 a dollar value is placed on time spent in the office.\" In the UK and Europe, the availability of remote work has been scarcer \u2013 for example, an October 2023 survey of 15,000 employers and employees in the UK showed that 43% of workers had returned to fully in-office settings. This means the trend for an in-person premium is expected to be weaker than the US, says Pollak. In the current cost-cutting climate, offering employees flexibility over a pay bump seems like a win for both sides. Yet despite this, some bosses are willing to increase their wage bills in exchange for full offices, because they believe the trade-off is worth it, says Pollak \u2013 the expense will lead to improved business outcomes. \"Among some employers, there can be a perception that remote workers are less productive,\" she adds. Many are also \"psychologically and financially invested in their corporate real estate\" \u2013 they want to fill their workplaces, at whatever cost. More like this: There's an unintended consequence to this salary discrepancy, says Barbara Petrongolo, professor of economics at the University of Oxford: it could reinforce inequities in the labour market. \"Those with caring responsibilities tend to prefer flexibility, and that's disproportionately women. So, if the highest-paid jobs offer less flexibility, some sections of the workforce are forced to essentially give up higher-paying opportunities.\" If bosses really want their workers in offices, the current premium offered for a fully in-person workweek is likely to remain for a while, say experts \u2013 there is no sign that flexible working patterns are disappearing. For example, ZipRecruiter's March 2024 data shows that around 33% of professional and business-service roles in the US are advertised with hybrid or remote working. \"Workers still want flexibility, and there are plenty of jobs advertising the ability to work from home at least two days a week,\" says\u00a0Petrongolo. \"So, in order to impose inflexible working conditions which are unfavourable to the employee, employers have to continue to pay more.\" --\u00a0 If you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",

            "text": "An American pilot, caught over the alcohol limit before he was due to fly a passenger plane from Edinburgh to New York, has been jailed for 10 months.  Lawrence Russell, 63, was searched by airport security officers at about 09:15 on 16 June last year.  He was found to have two bottles of J\u00e4germeister in his carry on luggage - one of which was half full. A breath test revealed the Delta Airlines captain was more than twice the legal alcohol limit for pilots.  Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard Russell, from Georgia, has been treated for alcoholism.  Delta has been contacted for comment. The court heard Russell had not less than 49mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood.  This exceeded the strict legal limit which is 20mg of alcohol. Sheriff Alison Stirling said a prison sentence had to be imposed as a punishment and for the \"protection of the public\". The court previously heard the pilot was to take control of a Boeing 767 flight from Edinburgh Airport to JFK Airport in New York, which was due to take off at 10:35. His bags were selected for inspection by security staff who were said to have \"noted Mr Russell was wearing a pilot uniform, a lanyard around his neck and a Delta Airline crew pass\". The captain was \"identified as the owner of the bag\", which contained two bottles of the herbal liqueur. Fiscal depute Matthew Millar told the court one of the bottles had been opened and was \"half full\". Mr Millar said: \"Given Mr Russell was wearing a pilot uniform the police were contacted. \"Mr Russell identified himself to the constables and said he was the captain of the aircraft.\" He provided police with a sample of breath and, after being arrested, was taken to Livingston police station, West Lothian, where he provided a blood sample. The fiscal depute said when Russell was cautioned and charged he told officers: \"I'm terrified\". Following the pilot's arrest, the flight to New York was cancelled and Delta Airlines confirmed all the passengers were then helped with their travel plans. On Tuesday the court heard the father-of-two also has two previous convictions for driving while under the influence of alcohol in the US. Defence lawyer Pamela Rodgers said her client was a recovering alcoholic who had not drunk alcohol for 277 days and had completed the 12 Steps to Recovery rehab programme. Ms Rodgers said Russell was just the fourth pilot to be prosecuted in Scotland for attempting to fly while under the influence of alcohol and was \"remorseful\" for his actions. Lynne Barrie, procurator fiscal for Lothian and Borders, said: \"Lawrence Russell's conduct would have endangered many lives; the consequences could have been catastrophic.  \"He showed a reckless disregard for the safety of his passengers and crew. The pilot of a commercial aircraft holds the lives of hundreds in his hands. He would have put all of them at serious risk.   \"This conviction should send the message that crimes of this nature will be robustly dealt with.\"",

Brian Jokat said a number of people suffered head injuries after the Latam Airlines jet dropped unexpectedly, throwing some out of their seats. Fifty were hurt and 12 were taken to hospital on landing in Auckland. Emergency services said one person was in a serious condition. In total, New Zealand's St John ambulance service said it had \"assessed and treated approximately\" 50 patients who had been travelling on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which had taken off from Sydney. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Jokat revealed that people had hit the ceiling with such force \"some of the roof panels were broken\" while others had been thrown down the aisles after the plane \"dropped unlike anything\" he had ever experienced before. The person next to him, he added, appeared to be \"glued to the ceiling\". \"I did think for a split second: 'This is it',\" he said. \"There was blood coming from several people's heads and people were yelling and screaming and it was chaos,\" Mr Jokat added. Another passenger told Radio New Zealand they saw people \"flying around\" and leaving traces of their blood on the ceiling. Some were not wearing their seatbelts, Radio New Zealand reported, quoting one of those on board. Further details about the \"technical event\" or what caused it are still not known. FlightAware, an airline tracker, shows the aircraft losing altitude about two hours into the three-hour flight between the two cities. Chilean-Brazilian carrier Latam Airlines said it \"deeply\" regretted \"any inconvenience and discomfort this situation may have caused its passengers\". It said \"a technical event during the flight\" had \"caused a strong movement\" but provided no further information. \"The plane landed at Auckland Airport as scheduled,\" it added. The aircraft was scheduled to fly on from Auckland to Santiago, the capital of Chile.  The departure was cancelled and a new flight scheduled for Tuesday, RNZ reported.",

Richard Longthorp, 71, a pig farmer from Howden, East Yorkshire, completed the challenge at St Paul's Boxing Academy, Hull, during January. On one occasion, he completed his 1,000 press-ups in 56 minutes. The money has been split between St Paul\u2019s, Goole Amateur Boxing Club and the charity Parkinson\u2019s UK. Mr Longthorp was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease in 2017.  He responded by taking up boxing and joining St Paul\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s Punchers boxing group, which he said had been hugely beneficial in helping to live with the condition. The group said boxing was increasingly being recognised as an effective way of mitigating many of the symptoms of Parkinson's, improving co-ordination, balance and posture.  Parkinson's UK said research had found \"offering group-based, Parkinson's-specific boxing sessions that are adaptable, varied and encourage social support and networking may be beneficial to increasing motivation for physical activity in people with Parkinson's\". Mr Longthorp said: \u201cWhen I started, I had a target of \u00a32,000 so it\u2019s incredibly humbling to have raised more than \u00a322,000. I can\u2019t thank people enough for their support. \u201cThe boxing sessions have been hugely beneficial to me and my fellow Parkinson\u2019s Punchers. It\u2019s really heartening to think that the money raised will go to help increase the provision for more Parkinson\u2019s boxing sessions.\u201d Olympic champion Luke Campbell is among those who trained at St Paul's Boxing Academy.  Head coach Mike Bromby MBE said: \u201cWe can\u2019t thank Richard enough - not just for the funds but also for the way he\u2019s an inspiration for the whole St Paul\u2019s family. Boxing is all about getting back up and Richard is the epitome of that.  \u201cThe sessions we run for people with Parkinson\u2019s are relaxed and informal.

            "text": "New Zealand's deputy prime minister Winston Peters says he \"does not care\" about the row over using Chumbawamba hit Tubthumping at a political rally. The UK band had accused him of \"hijacking\" the song and had asked their recording label to issue a \"cease and desist\" letter. \"It seems the media care more about the Chumbawamba story than we do. We actually don't care,\" Mr Peters said.  \"There's nothing to 'cease or desist',\" he wrote on X on Wednesday. Mr Peters, who leads the right-wing New Zealand First Party that is part of the governing coalition, walked on to stage to Tubthumping ahead of a controversial speech last weekend. He ended by referring to its famous lyrics, saying: \"We got knocked down, but we got up again.\" The band protested, saying they did not support his political views and did not want him to use their song during his rallies.  But Mr Peters said on Wednesday, \"The song worked like a charm for our first public meeting after the election. The over 700 people in the crowd thought so too.\" Though the band released several singles, Mr Peters took aim at Tubthumping being Chumbawamba's biggest commercial success.   \"I would use another of their hit song titles as a quip at the end of this post but unfortunately they only had one,\" he wrote on X. Chumbawamba's former lead singer and one of it's founding members, Dunstan Bruce, told the BBC's Newshour programme that the song was written about a large mixed and migrant population coming together in Leeds in the UK. \"For this guy, Winston Peters, to then try and hijack the song and use it as part of his campaign, where he is expressing political views that I find quite egregious, I just thought that that's not something that we could just sit back and let happen.\" Mr Peters has used Tubthumping in previous rallies, and Mr Bruce said the song had been used by others as well in a way that upset the band. \"It's happened quite a few times with the right-wing politicians in the United States, in the UK, in Australia, who've all tried to use the song, and now obviously New Zealand,\" Mr Bruce said.  He added that they usually respond by sending a \"cease and desist\" letter to \"publicise the fact that our politics do not align with these people on the right\". \"They obviously see the song as a populist song... the message of the song is quite universal. It's quite easy for people to misinterpret it or to not know anything about the band who created that song,\" he said.  The BBC has contacted Sony Music Publishing to ask whether it has made any contact with Mr Peters and New Zealand First - but is yet to receive a reply. On X, Mr Peters, said, \"We will be sure to file the 'cease and desist' letter in a safe place if it ever arrives.\" In the hour-long \"state of the nation\" speech which sparked the controversy, the NZ First leader talked about plans to remove gender and sexuality lessons from the school curriculum and said that NZ First and their supporters have a \"real chance to take back our country\". He also appeared to compare shared decision-making between M\u0101ori people and the Crown - known as co-governance - to the race-based theories of Nazi Germany. But he later attacked the media for \"misreporting\" this part of his speech. New Zealand's prime minister Christopher Luxon has said he had a \"private conversation\" with Mr Peters over his comments. Former PM and Labour leader Chris Hipkins accused Mr Peters of \"using racism and anti-media rhetoric to divide our country\", adding \"Kiwis deserve better than a deputy prime minister who behaves like a drunk uncle at a wedding\". Under New Zealand's quasi-PR electoral system, voters choose a local \"electorate\" MP and separately a favoured party, known as the \"party vote\".  In addition to electorate MPs, a number of seats are assigned to parties who gain more than 5% of the \"party vote\", on a proportional basis. The MPs for these seats are chosen by the party from a published list. Mr Peters' party won no electorate seats in the last election, gaining just 2.6% of votes. However, it gained eight MPs due to receiving 6% of the \"party vote\". ",

            "text": "Student Pooja Umashankar clearly remembers when she first felt the roar of an aircraft taking off. She was 10 years old and travelling from Sri Lanka to the UK with her family. Through the window near her seat, she could see hundreds of tiny lights on the ground below.  \"It's just a piece of metal,\" she remembers marvelling, \"And it's flying now.\" Today, a decade and a half later, Miss Umashankar has returned from Sri Lanka to study aircraft maintenance engineering at the University of South Wales. \"I knew that I wanted to do something that nobody had ever done in my town,\" she says. The aviation industry can't find enough people like Miss Umashankar. For years, airlines and engineering firms have struggled to hire maintenance engineers, and there is now a global shortage numbering in the tens of thousands.  This is a huge problem not least because aviation is expected to balloon in the coming decades. Industry estimates suggest that roughly 700,000 engineers will have to enter the profession between now and 2040 in order to satisfy demand.  Plus, after Boeing's recent 737 Max 9 door blowout - currently the subject of an investigation - engineers have been in especially high demand to perform increased checks on 737 Max aircraft of various models.  And trade association ADS says there are 10,000 vacancies in total across the UK's aerospace, defence, security and space industries. Miss Umashankar, who is now nearing the end of her three-year degree, says she wants to be a part of the solution. \"What motivates me is to\u2026 help people travel,\" she says. \"I want to help them fly - while being safe.\" She says she has especially enjoyed working with electronics during her course but was not able to find an on-the-job training placement. However, Miss Umashankar has now started applying for full-time positions. She hopes to work for an employer that will treat her with respect and provide further training.  Not many of her colleagues will be women, she knows. But that does not deter her: \"There's such a shortage of female engineers in this field, I just feel that maybe I should be one of them.\" Redressing the severe gender imbalance in the industry could help tackle the shortage, some observers say. In the UK, fewer than 10% of aerospace and aviation engineers are women. The numbers are even worse across the Atlantic, says Gail Rouscher, a former aircraft maintenance engineer now at Western Michigan University. Only 2.8% of US aircraft technicians are women. \"I don't think that there are enough women that are involved in the industry to act as mentors,\" she says. Multiple engineering firms contacted by the BBC declined to specify whether they were short of aviation technicians at present, or to what extent. AAR Corporation, however, says it has raised salaries and launched a programme to help US military veterans join the workforce. More than 60 such candidates have been hired since 2019, the firm notes. ST Engineering has started a mentorship programme in Singapore and is in talks to set up a training academy in the US. Meanwhile, Lufthansa Technik is working to attract more women into the industry. \"Large-scale recruitment of apprentices is still ongoing,\" a spokeswoman adds. The current focus on training is significant, says Daniel Olufisan, training director and principal consultant at Wing Engineering, which works in the aviation industry. It is partly down to the fact that fewer aircraft engineers these days are ex-military and, therefore, not as many people with hands-on experience are entering maintenance roles, he suggests. Another key reason for the shortage is that a high number of engineers in their 60s are now retiring from the profession. Aircraft maintenance is not as glamorous as it once was, suggests Robert Mann, an industry analyst and consultant at RW Mann & Company: \"Some of the benefits that then came with working for an airline, flying on staff passes for example, just aren't there anymore.\" He stresses that a dearth of engineers is no excuse to cut corners on safety. \"This is not a test flying business, this is a consumer service,\" he says. Last year, manufacturer Airbus set a target of hiring 13,000 new employees, many of whom were engineers, though in Airbus's case most were destined to work on new aircraft designs rather than maintenance. A spokeswoman confirms that the company exceeded its target and also succeeded in hiring a large proportion of engineers (25% of the total). \"It does become harder and harder to source talented professional engineers,\" acknowledges Mark Crompton, global head of employment marketing. He adds that outreach to children of school age could help encourage them to consider the career. More technology of business Airbus, like many firms, is increasing apprenticeship and internship positions to help, too. The number of such posts at Airbus climbed by 25% in 2023. But the industry as a whole is having to face up to the impact aviation is having on climate change and even more engineers are needed to develop cleaner aircraft, explains Mr Crompton. Nadeem Bandali is an aircraft maintenance engineer at Gatwick Airport. He says that when young people ask him about his job, he shows them videos of the kind of work he does to illustrate how practical it is. \"It's purely mechanical, fixing aircraft, troubleshooting aircraft systems,\" he explains.  As an example, just a few weeks ago, he and his colleagues were tasked with locating a fault in a long sensor wire that runs through the fuselage and wings of an A320. It took a few hours, but they found it and fixed it.  He is aware of the engineer shortage but says, \"I don't think safety is an issue at the moment.\" Keeping planes in the air, without incident, is a worthwhile endeavour for Miss Umashankar. \"Aircraft,\" she says, \"connect the whole world into one.\"",

            "text": "Air traffic chaos over last year's August bank holiday was made worse by on-call engineers being unable to fix the issue from home, a report has said. More than 700,000 passengers were affected by an air traffic meltdown that had knock-on effects for days. Industry group Airlines UK said the report, compiled for the Civil Aviation Authority, showed air traffic control processes were \"wholly inadequate\". Air traffic provider NATS said it had made \"improvements\" since last summer. Airlines have said the delays cost them tens of millions of pounds. On 28 August last year, a busy bank holiday Monday, there was a major technical failure at NATS which led to widespread flight disruption that left thousands of passengers stranded. An independent interim report into what went wrong, which was commissioned by the Civil Aviation Authority, found the problem started when the NATS system struggled to cope with an unusual flight plan and shut down. A backup system also shut down, leaving manual processing of flight plans as the only option. NATS engineers working on site could not fix the issue, so the problem was escalated to on-call engineers higher up the chain. It took one of the senior engineers an hour and a half to get to the NATS site and try to perform a system restart, which was not possible remotely. That specialist engineer did not get there until more than three hours into the incident. Help was then sought from another engineer, and system manufacturer Frequentis was called after four hours, when stored flight plan data had run out. The system was down for close to six-and-three-quarter hours. About three quarters of a million passengers were affected by the incident - which caused widespread cancellations on a bank holiday Monday - with \"considerable financial and emotional consequences\", the report said. That includes 300,000 people hit by cancellations, 95,000 by long delays of more than three hours, and a further 300,000 by shorter delays. The report said improvements to resilience planning would be needed to prevent a similar meltdown in future. There does not seem to have been any rehearsal of how to manage such an incident, despite that being \"best practice\" and common in other sectors. The report describes \"a significant lack of pre-planning and coordination\" between different parts of the industry for unusual \"major events and incidents\". It also outlines how airlines and airports have expressed concerns about delays in being warned that there was a problem, and \"limited explanation\" during the event. For example, regional and City airports found out about the problems from BBC News, with no communications from NATS on the day. Communication issues, the report says, \"resulted in more uncertainty and more severe impacts on passengers and others than was necessary\". It also said some airlines told passengers they had to make their own plans to get home, with \"misinformation\" about their rights. An example was given of a passenger and her child stranded abroad being handed a leaflet saying they should make their own arrangements and then claim reimbursement. They could only find flights four or five days later. The airline said it would only reimburse for one overnight stay. It cost them \u00a3900. However, there were some good examples of individuals being offered all the appropriate assistance. The panel said the scale of disruption made providing care and assistance much harder, as so many people were stranded at the same time, on a busy bank holiday. Airports, restaurants and hotels, and most importantly alternative flights, quickly became full. While airlines made \"huge efforts\" to be there for customers in many cases, there were incidents where \"incomplete or incorrect information was given about passenger rights\", food vouchers were not accepted or not enough hotel accommodation was offered. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK said the interim report \"contains damning evidence that NATS' basic resilience planning and procedures were wholly inadequate and fell well below the standard that should be expected for national infrastructure of this importance\". He added further investigation would lead to recommendations in the final report \"so that this kind of catastrophic failure is not allowed to happen again\". NATS said it had \"cooperated fully\" with the investigation. \"We have not waited for the panel's report to make improvements for handling future events based on learning from the experience of last year,\" the air traffic provider said. \"These include a review of our engagement with our airline customers, our wider crisis response and our engineering support processes.\"",

            "text": "Ultra high-definition cameras from a UK start-up are on their way to the International Space Station (ISS).  The 4K system from SEN.COM will be attached to the front of the orbital outpost to capture what are expected to be some stunning views of Earth. The London company already streams live video from a small satellite it launched in 2022. Boss Charles Black says he plans to extend the company's technology to many more locations, including the Moon. \"Our goal is to bring a whole new way of seeing space, Earth and the Moon,\" he told BBC News.  \"We want to put cameras in lunar orbit, on the lunar surface and on lunar rovers, filming astronauts as humans return to the Moon.  \"We want to tell that story.\" The ISS cameras are being carried up on the latest US space agency re-supply mission. More than 2.5 tonnes of food, clothing, equipment and scientific experiments were launched atop a SpaceX rocket from Florida at 16:55 local time (20:55 GMT). After arrival on Saturday, SEN's camera payload will be prepped by the station crew and then put through an airlock to be placed on the Bartolomeo deck - a piece of exterior structure connected to the European Columbus science module. The big robotic CanadaArm-2 will do the manoeuvres, scheduled for May.  One camera will look straight ahead at the horizon, capturing sunrises and sunsets, as well as the northern and southern lights.  A second camera will point straight down, to focus on what's happening on Planet Earth. The capacity scene size will be about 180km by 240km (110 miles by 150 miles). It will see features as small as 60m across.  The controlling software should be able to adjust the exposures so that when the station moves into darkness, city lights will be visible. A third camera will be directed at the forward docking point to record the comings and goings of space capsules - the SpaceX Dragon ship and the soon-to-debut Boeing Starliner. The plan is to stream 4K video - jumping between these cameras - more or less continuously. The data will come down through the European Space Agency's relay system, which bounces signals to the ground via high-throughput satellites positioned high above the space station. You can get a feel for the type of video anticipated from the samples on this page. They were captured by SEN's ETV-A1 satellite, which has been operating for the past two years at an altitude of 505km. More of these spacecraft are currently being assembled. Again, it's a mix of wide and narrow-angle views.  The London company is monetising these products, working, for example, with film and TV companies on documentaries. The firm is also hoping to engender interest from news organisations who might want to reflect events in a different way, especially if those events have global reach. Last year's Canadian wildfires would be a good example. Seeing their fire fronts and smoke plumes gives a much clearer sense of just how big an area was burnt. SEN is by no means the first company to move into the \"video from space\" market, but Mr Black believes he can find success by packaging the material in the right way.  \"Video from space is important and will be big business... because real-time video has story-telling power, and can deliver insights about what's happening directly to people, in the same way Google does,\" he said.  \"Google Earth had over a billion downloads to look at static imagery, so a real-time dataset about Earth which tells the story of what's unfolding on Earth and in space right now, which is fully searchable and uses artificial intelligence and augmented reality to show insights, will be a mass data product for humanity.  \"No-one has addressed that market before, and that's what we're doing.\"",

            "text": "Boeing has confirmed it has begun talks aimed at buying Spirit Aerosystems. Spirit has a major operation in Northern Ireland but it is unclear if Boeing would keep that part of the business. The Reuters news agency has reported that Airbus has explored the possibility of buying's Spirit's NI operation. Spirit manufactures the wings for the Airbus A220 at a factory in Belfast. Reuters added that a deal with Airbus is not likely to happen in the short term. Spirit is one of Northern Ireland's largest and most important manufacturing businesses with more than 3,000 employees. The company has been in Northern Ireland since 2019 when it bought Bombardier's operations, ending a long period of uncertainty for the workforce. However the ownership of the Belfast operation is now in question again because of problems in Spirit's US business. Spirit began life as a spin-off from Boeing in 2005 and remains a key Boeing supplier, particularly for the Boeing 737. Some of its work for Boeing has suffered from delays and quality issues which has exacerbated problems at Boeing. In a statement on Friday Boeing said: \"We believe that the reintegration of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems' manufacturing operations would further strengthen aviation safety, improve quality and serve the interests of our customers, employees, and shareholders. \"We have been working closely with Spirit AeroSystems and its leadership to strengthen the quality of the commercial airplanes that we build together. We confirm that our collaboration has resulted in preliminary discussions about making Spirit AeroSystems a part of Boeing again.\" The statement added that there can be no assurance that a deal will be reached. Spirit also confirmed that talks are underway adding it does not intend to comment further on market speculation until it deems further disclosure is appropriate or required. When Spirit bought Bombardier's NI operations in 2019 it ended a long period of uncertainty for around 3,000 workers. In the years before that deal there were real fears Bombardier could go bust, as the development of new passenger plane went hugely over time and budget. But less than five years on the uncertainty has now returned. If Boeing buys Spirit it is unlikely to want to continue working as a supplier to its arch rival, Airbus. Selling the A220 wing plant to Airbus would seem logical - but what about the other non-Airbus work which Spirit does in Belfast?  Airbus has said it does not comment on market speculation. Separately, the two firms are continuing to negotiate on what Spirit is paid for its work on the A220. ",

The company, a major global air parts supplier, was spun out of Boeing in 2005 as part of a cost-cutting drive.  It continues to rely on Boeing for more than two-thirds of its business. Boeing has been under pressure over its manufacturing pipeline after a piece of one of its planes blew off in mid-air in January. The US government's review of the blowout found that bolts meant to fasten the panel had been removed at Boeing's factory in Washington, apparently to fix damaged rivets, and had never been re-installed.  The piece had been made by Spirit, before being sent to Boeing for final assembly. This week, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has been examining Boeing since the incident, gave Boeing 90 days to develop a \"comprehensive action plan\" for improving its safety management systems.  Boeing has already been working closely with Spirit to address a spate of quality issues, which have caused delays to plane deliveries and led to the appointment of a new chief executive at Spirit last year. In a statement on Friday to Reuters news agency, Boeing said: \"We believe that the reintegration of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems' manufacturing operations would further strengthen aviation safety, improve quality and serve the interests of our customers, employees, and shareholders.\" Following reports of takeover talks, shares in Spirit jumped by more than 10% on Friday, giving it a market value of more than $3.7bn. But shares in Boeing slid more than 1% after the discussions were first reported in the Wall Street Journal. Spirit, which the Journal said was also considering a sale of its Northern Irish unit to Airbus, did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.  Spirit employs more than 20,600 people around the world, including about 3,400 in Belfast and 1,120 in Prestwick.",

            "text": "The 1940s film star was worshipped for her looks \u2013 but they were also a poisoned chalice when it came to her career and legacy. Nearly a century on, has the way we consider beauty changed all that much? Female beauty is a concept that is coloured by power dynamics and symbolism. It has classical ideals, but ever-shifting goalposts, dependent on decade or era. And like so much that is feminine, it is also derided. Too much concern with beauty, in oneself or others, is often seen as frivolous, even while its social currency \u2013 and the fact of it still having currency \u2013 remain fascinating elements of Western culture and society. All of this to say: anyone in the public eye who is given the title of \"the most beautiful woman\" is handed something of a poisoned chalice.\u00a0\u00a0    Gene Tierney was one of many actresses in Hollywood, past and present, who have been so labelled, described as \"unquestionably the\u00a0most beautiful woman in movie\u00a0history\" by studio head Darryl Zanuck. Blessed with aqua-blue, cat-like eyes, and an unnervingly symmetrical face, she was almost doll-like in her appearance; an impression aided by the carefully painted red lips of her era. She became famous at the start of the 1940s, a time of the bombshell and the pin-up.\u00a0If her contemporaries in Hollywood screen beauty were the likes of Rita Hayworth, Ava Gardner and Hedy Lamarr, it was certainly saying something that Tierney was consistently referred to as the most beautiful of them all. In the British Film Institute's April season Out of the Shadows: The Films of Gene Tierney, programmer Aga Baranowska seeks to highlight an actress whose work was overshadowed by this very fact. And by screening a variety of her lesser-seen films, it also raises some interesting questions about what the finite power of beauty does to the woman in possession of it when it's projected on to a cinema screen. Tierney's career began at the start of 1940s when she was first contracted to 20th-Century Fox at 19. She came from a well-off family in Fairfield, Connecticut, where she had made her society debut aged 17, and it was, as she once noted, expected she would soon go off to marry a Yale boy. After some small parts on Broadway, her dazzling looks quickly attracted the attention of the studios, and her first major screen role came in 1942, with screwball comedy Rings on her Fingers, opposite Henry Fonda. Publicity build-up almost always featured \u2013 and embellished \u2013 her high-society background, and her persona of coolly elegant, ladylike composure. But it didn\u2019t quite disguise the fact that Fox often did not know what to do with Tierney. They spoke of her as a debutante but cast her in a revolving-door of parts in an attempt to figure out where she fit. Too sultry for comedy and too refined to seem low-born, the Irish-American even found herself cast in various racially ambiguous parts, with her skin intentionally darkened or her eyes elongated with makeup to give her the then-in-vogue (and deeply problematic) \"exotic\" look.\u00a0 But Tierney seemed to have a knack for film noir most of all. There were her two best-known pictures \u2013 Leave Her to Heaven (1945) and Laura (1944) \u2013 her work with director Otto Preminger in Where the Sidewalk Ends and Whirlpool, two other moody film noirs both released in 1950 which see her star opposite leading man Dana Andrews, also stand out among her finest. In London-set noir Night and the City (also 1950), she's given somewhat less to do, but the film is stellar. Tierney had a talent for revealing vulnerability beneath an icy veneer, and could turn it not only to crime films but to serious drama, as with underrated W Somerset Maugham adaptation The Razor\u2019s Edge (1946). In gorgeous Technicolor widescreen, daylight noir Leave Her to Heaven (1946) sees Tierney at the radiant height of her fame and good looks playing a vicious murderess \u2013 a role that would result in her only Oscar nomination. Yet her beauty is not weaponised in the way we might expect: she is not so much a sexual conniver or money-hungry dame per the genre pinnacles of Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity or Jane Greer in Out of the Past.\u00a0Tierney is instead a pristine newlywed housewife who is so monstrously possessive of her husband's time and attention that she slowly cuts off and destroys each of the close relationships in his life. It's telling that it deploys Tierney's elegant looks as an exterior for a psychotic mind. While her character is perfectly made-up and seemingly in control, her mind seems ravaged by destructive impulses. Her beauty is also key in Otto Preminger's film noir Laura (1944), a hypnotic story of infatuation and murder. These days, few non-cinephiles are likely to recall Tierney's name, but to see her in Laura is to remember her forever. The story revolves around a detective's obsessive search for a murdered woman after growing intrigued by a painting of her. It has shades of many dreamy, sex-and-death obsessed mysteries made since, from Hitchcock's Vertigo (1957) to several of David Lynch's works. Pivotally, the film's place in the cultural imagination stems from that painting of Tierney as Laura: her beauty is captured in time forever in this manner, precluding the real-life risks of ageing and mortality. This can't help but feel like an apt metaphor about the relationship between a star's beauty being captured and frozen in time in celluloid film, too. As Elena Parker, the founder of Gene Tierney Online and her forthcoming biographer, tells the BBC: \"Gene expressed appreciation that she continued to be identified with Laura long after the conclusion of her career, rather than not being remembered at all. While the enduring power of Laura may not have necessarily furthered her acting legacy, it has bestowed on Gene longevity in beauty culture.\" The BFI season offers a corrective to the powerful narrative of Tierney's beauty, or to her tragic personal life, which often has taken up more air than her films (she suffered from mental health struggles and an unlucky exposure to rubella during her first pregnancy, which would leave her daughter severely disabled). Cliches of \"tragic beauty\" or the \"prettiness that helped destroy her\" are an old morality play and nothing more. Tierney wrote in her 1979 memoir Self-Portrait of her appearance and her time in mental health facilities: \"I have always needed to believe that my career survived on more than how I looked. I have no deeper meaning to plumb, no point to make about beauty and craziness. A friend once asked a doctor if he thought my life might have been easier, if I might not have needed confining, if I had been less pretty. 'No,' he said bluntly. 'They have ugly people in there, too.'\"\u00a0 It may seem quaint to look all the way back to Tierney, one of the stars of the 1940s, as a signifier of female beauty. After all, we might be inclined to think that a great deal has changed since. Then, body diversity was not remotely of interest; in Tierney's Hollywood, a woman's shape should be slim and hourglass, with diets, corsets and S-shaped dresses to reinforce that. Nor was comfort of interest: it was a time before baggy jeans, fluffy-brow trends, or athleisure. There was an extremely narrow ideal of attractive femininity \u2013 white, thin, coiffed, manicured, and with no visible freckles, fat, or racial difference (unless they were playing a role that should have gone to a person of colour to begin with, and usually did not). And so the all-male studio heads and their teeming departments of make-up artists saw to that, with putty to apply to crooked noses and careful diagrams of star faces which they sought to categorise by shape and then correct with cosmetics and hairstyle. More like this:  As Cathy Lomax, an artist and Hollywood makeup expert with a PhD in star studies and cosmetics, writes in her thesis Making Up the Star: Makeup, Femininity, Race and Ageing\u00a0 in Hollywood, 1950\u20131970: \"This eschewing of realism extended to the, all but identical, make-up worn by stars. Jean Porter, who was under contract at MGM in the 1940s observed, 'Our mouths were all made up the same [\u2026] our eyebrows were very much the same, our makeup was an awful lot alike.'\"\u00a0 Since Tierney's day, of course, some things have undeniably changed for the better in the industry: now there is greater body diversity, and growing resistance to fatphobia, racist typecasting and whitewashing. Sometimes we even see real, everyday teeth or skin texture onscreen \u2013 though usually in independent films like Paul Thomas Anderson's Licorice Pizza (2021) or Bo Burnham's Eighth Grade (2018), and still rarely enough for it to be notable.\u00a0 But while Gene Tierney's claim in Self-Portrait that she was hungry for 20 years in Hollywood because \"a certain thinness would add attractive contours to my face\", may seem like the refuge of an old, bad past, it's fair to say the current craze around weight-loss drug Ozempic still shows that the entertainment business has not come quite as far as we would all hope.\u00a0And the aforementioned factory-line beautifying doesn't sound too different from what New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino coined as \"Instagram face\", the phenomena of cyborgian-similar features on the app due to a combination of filters and aesthetic treatments. The beauty standards themselves may have shifted slightly, but the rush to attain a certain Stepford Wife consistency has not.\u00a0\u00a0 Similarly, if today the Hollywood concept of \"natural\" beauty is often undergirded by aesthetic treatments like dermal filler or brow lifts, the only distinction is that it was more secretive in old Tinseltown. In Tierney's era, star-sculpting techniques included dangerous violet-ray freckle peels, painful electrolysis on pesky hairlines, and even very early plastic surgery, usually on jawlines or noses which photographed mildly askew from one side.\u00a0 \u00a0 Even today's fashionable \"no-makeup\" makeup look, too, had roots in the golden age \u2013 surprisingly, given the obvious affectation of high-glamour at play in the mid-century. \"There is\u00a0a lot of talk about Gene Tierney's skin being so perfect that she didn't need to wear makeup on-screen. This weird 'no-makeup' claim is something else that is often repeated \u2013 it plays into the idea that a really truly beautiful woman does not need makeup, which is something used to cover imperfections, and tricks unsuspecting men,\" says Lomax. Stars from Ingrid Bergman straight through to Alicia Keys have been celebrated for their \"no makeup\" looks, regardless of the veracity of the claims. Historian Kathy Peiss, in her book Hope in a Jar: the Making of American Beauty Culture, sums up the paradox when she explains: \"Even Max Factor, whose makeup was most closely associated with Hollywood glamour, described the 'magic of makeup' to be an illusionism that made it 'impossible for anyone to detect where the make-up begins or ends'. But looking natural, like looking glamorous, now required a box full of beauty devices.\" Today's \"most beautiful\" stars  For proof that the industry's attitudes towards beauty are as confusing as ever, you just need to look to twentysomething Hollywood beauties like Zendaya or Sydney Sweeney, both of whom emerged from a television show, Euphoria, where visible cosmetics were the source of much of the discourse. Zendaya has spoken about putting on an alter-ego for her big red-carpet and photoshoot moments; that it isn't her who's there, but a sort of persona of another woman that she \"has to buy\". And Sweeney, whose beauty is still as classic-as-they-come, has been roundly derided on social media for having the temerity of being self-aware about it. Both of them, with their many cosmetics and skincare sponsorships \u2013 like stars of old who were contracted to help advertise makeup \u2013 live with the contradiction whereby beauty enhancement is a source of both discomfort and celebration. Plus ca change. Hollywood, as the primary US image-maker of the past 100 years, would be unlikely to exist in its current form without the beauty industry, reliant as it was on creating lived-in celluloid dreams for its viewers, and perfecting the face for the advent of the movie close-up. And the beauty industry may never have reached the pinnacle of its popularity without film stars to help promote it.  However, as Tierney and her ilk showed us, performance could be in dialogue with one's appearance\u00a0\u2013 and with preconceptions about what that beauty meant. Take Tierney's would-be killer in Laura, discussing how he moulded her into the perfect society beauty under his patriarchal (I daresay studio mogul-esque) instruction. Or Marilyn Monroe pouting in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes that she could be smart, but that men didn't like it.\u00a0It's in these ways that women of Tierney's generation could, at least, put themselves in the narrative about their own beauty. The beauties of 2024 have equally played with their \"beautiful\" image on screen in interesting ways \u2013 take, for instance, Sweeney's current starring role in nunsploitation-horror Immaculate, which deals with the objectification of women's bodies. Plus the fragmentation of an all-in-one publicity machine means that although social-media coverage of their lives and faces can be all-consuming, it is also democratic: they have a direct pipeline to their fans and can transmit whatever images of themselves they wish. Nonetheless, the architects of cosmetic perfection in Hollywood have been responsible for so much of how women, in particular, relate to seeing an avatar of themselves \u2013 \u00a0whether it's on social media, or, for a few, on the cinema screen. Gene Tierney understood the pitfalls of this as well as any Gen Z star might. The idea that women in the spotlight may ever be fully free from it seems like a distant dream.

            "text": "A new report for the US government has raised serious concerns about Boeing's safety management systems, adding to the scrutiny facing the US plane maker. The review found a \"disconnect\" between senior management and regular staff, and signs that safety-related messages and behaviours were not effectively implemented across the company. The report was ordered after crashes involving Boeing planes in 2018 and 2019. Boeing pledged to review the findings. \"We've taken important steps to foster a safety culture that empowers and encourages all employees to share their voice. But there is more work to do,\" the company said.  \"We will carefully review the panel's assessment and learn from their findings, as we continue our comprehensive efforts to improve our safety and quality programs.\" The company, one of two major global plane makers, has been under added pressure since last month, when a section of one of its passenger jets blew off in mid-air, forcing an emergency landing.  The incident, which narrowly avoided serious harm, revived questions about Boeing's manufacturing processes, years after the 2018 and 2019 accidents, which killed 346 people and led to accusations that the company had put profits before safety as it produced its planes. The panel of experts, which was convened after the earlier crashes, said Boeing had taken steps to improve, but that it saw indications of \"gaps in Boeing's safety journey\". It said some Boeing staff were hesitant to report problems and worried about retaliation because of how the reporting process was set up. Boeing also did not have a clear system for reporting problems and tracking how those concerns were resolved, it said.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would also review the findings. The agency is currently investigating Boeing's manufacturing processes, triggered by the 5 January blowout. It has barred the company from expanding production of its popular 737 Max planes while the review is under way. \"We will continue to hold Boeing to the highest standard of safety and will work to ensure the company comprehensively addresses these recommendations,\" the FAA said as it released the report.  The troubles at Boeing are expected to lead to delays delivering new planes to airlines, which Ryanair has said could cause ticket prices to rise. Other airlines have also voiced frustration over the issues.  Earlier this month, Boeing said it was replacing the person in charge of the 737 Max programme and creating a new position of senior vice president for quality.",

The legal limit is just 20mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood Fiscal depute Matthew Millar said when Russell, from Georgia, was cautioned and charged he told officers \"I'm terrified\".

            "title": "MH370: The families haunted by one of aviation's greatest mysteries",
            "text": "For the last decade, two words have haunted Li Eryou - lost contact.  It's what Malaysia Airlines told him when flight MH370 disappeared, with his son Yanlin on board.  \"For years I have been asking what do you mean by 'lost contact'? It seems to me that if you lose contact with someone, you should be able to reconnect with them,\" Mr Li says.  He and his wife, Liu Shuangfeng - farmers from a village south of Beijing - have struggled to make sense of what has become one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history.  On 8 March 2014, less than an hour into a routine night-time flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, the pilot said goodnight to Malaysian air traffic control. The Boeing 777, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members, was about to cross into Vietnamese air space.  It then abruptly changed direction, and all electronic communications were cut. It turned back, first over Malaysia, and then out into the remote southern Indian Ocean until it is presumed to have run out of fuel. The biggest and most expensive search operation ever mounted lasted four years but failed to find any trace of the missing airliner. Thousands of oceanographers, aeronautical engineers and amateur sleuths have pored over the fragmentary data from the flight, trying to calculate where it ended its journey.  For the families of those on board these have been 10 years of inescapable grief, battling to keep the search going, to find out exactly what happened to MH370, and why. Mr Li has crisscrossed the world in support of that campaign. He says he has used up his savings travelling to Europe and Asia, and to beaches in Madagascar, where some debris from the missing plane has been found.  He says he wanted to feel the sand in a place where his son might have washed up. He remembers shouting out at the Indian Ocean, telling Yanlin he was there to take him home. \"I will keep travelling to the end of the world to find my son,\" he says.  The couple, now in their late 60s, live in a rural part of China's Hebei province. Most of their income went to pay for their children's schooling, and they never had the money to travel.  Yanlin was the first person in their village to go to university, and the first to get a job overseas, working in Malaysia for a telecom company.  He was returning to China for a visa appointment when the flight disappeared. \"Before this incident happened, we had never even been to the nearby city of Handan,\" Mr Li says.  Now seasoned travellers, they came back to Malaysia to mark the 10th anniversary with other families.  Yanlin was one of 153 Chinese passengers on the flight. His parents are among around 40 Chinese families who have refused settlement payments from the Malaysian government, and have filed legal cases in China against the airline, the aircraft manufacturer and other parties.  Over 10 years, the lives of those affected have moved on, yet they also feel chained to the missing plane.  Grace Nathan was doing her final law exams in the UK when MH370 disappeared. Her mother Anne was on board. Today she is a barrister with her own practice in Malaysia, and a mother of two young children.  At the anniversary commemoration in Kuala Lumpur, she recalled holding her mother's photograph as she walked down the aisle at her wedding, and missing her advice while she was going through two difficult pregnancies. On display there were a few battered pieces from the plane, the only physical evidence ever to be recovered from it. There were parts of the wing, corroded from their long immersion in the sea, with the surprisingly flimsy-looking internal honeycomb structure exposed.  In the crowd was Blaine Gibson, who has found more pieces of MH370 than anyone else. One of a colourful cast of characters drawn into the MH370 saga, Mr Gibson can best be described as an amateur adventurer. He dresses in the style of Indiana Jones and has used the proceeds of the sale of his family home in California to fund his love of travelling, with a personal goal of visiting every country in the world. \"When I attended the one-year anniversary event I learned that there was no organised search of shorelines for floating debris. It simply hadn't been done. They were spending millions of dollars back then searching underwater. And I just thought, well, probably the first piece of this plane is just going to be found by someone walking on the beach. And since nobody was doing that, I thought I could do it myself.\" He says he searched for a year, on beaches from Myanmar to the Maldives, before finding his first piece, from the rear stabilizer of the plane, on a sandbar in Mozambique.  By that time another large piece, known as a flaperon, from the wing, had already been found on Reunion Island, confirming to the families that MH370 had indeed crashed into the Indian Ocean.  The parts that were found were all discovered 16 months or more after MH370 vanished, washed up on various East African beaches.  Analysis of the prevailing currents in the southern Indian Ocean showed they were likely to have come from where MH370 was believed to have crashed into the sea.  The former lead Malaysian investigator Aslam Khan explained how they identified them. Serial numbers on some parts were matched with records held by the manufacturer to confirm beyond doubt that they came from the Malaysia Airlines Boeing.  Distinctive fonts used in the stencil markings on others showed they were near certain to have come from it. No other Boeing 777 has ever crashed in the Indian Ocean. Until the flaperon was found, the only evidence for the plane turning back on itself was data from military radar in Malaysia and Thailand, which spotted the plane flying west over the Malay peninsula.   Then a British company, Inmarsat, detected a series of six pings or \"handshakes\" made every hour between one of its satellites and MH370 as it headed south. All other communication on the aircraft had been switched off.  This sparse data was used to triangulate the distance between the plane and the satellite at each hour along a series of circular arcs, giving an approximate crash location. But this was still a huge area of very rough and very deep sea.  The search, involving 60 ships and 50 aircraft from 26 countries, lasted from March 2014 until January 2017. It was resumed in early 2018 for five months by a private US-based company called Ocean Infinity, using underwater drones to scan the seabed. The lack of hard information has fuelled many theories, some quite wild, about what happened on board MH370, from it being hijacked and flown to Russia, or perhaps to the US airbase on the island of Diego Garcia, to it being shot down.  \"This is obscene,\" French journalist Florence de Changy muttered looking at the pieces of MH370 on display. Ms Changy has written a meticulously researched book, one of more than 100 published on MH370. She argues that the entire hypothesis that the plane turned and went south has been faked. She believes that the debris which has been found is not from MH370. She raises questions over the cargo on board, and in her book suggests that it may have been shot down by US aircraft over the South China Sea because of this cargo. If, however, the radar and satellite data presented by Malaysia and Inmarsat is accepted at face value - and most experts do - and that the airliner kept flying south, there is only one plausible explanation. That someone flew it there deliberately. In a new BBC documentary, \"Why Planes Vanish\", two French aerospace experts, one an experienced pilot, have used a flight simulator to recreate the sharp turn the Boeing 777 made over the South China Sea, right after the last contact with Malaysian air traffic control. They have concluded that this could only have been done manually by a skilled and experienced pilot. The fact that this was done just as MH370 was moving from Malaysian to Vietnamese air space suggests to them that the pilot was trying to conceal the manoeuvre. And that he knew it would be some time before Vietnamese air traffic control reported that they had not yet been contacted by the plane. There are other theories - that everyone on board was knocked out by hypoxia, lack of oxygen, after an undetected depressurisation, or that a sudden catastrophic fire or explosion cut communications and forced the pilots to turn back. But the difficult manoeuvres, followed by continued, steady flight south for seven hours, make these very unlikely.  Yet the idea that one of the pilots deliberately flew the plane and all its passengers to a watery death is also hard to accept. Neither pilot had any history that could explain such an action. All this feverish speculation has exacted a toll on the families. \"I would not wish this on my worst enemy,\" says Jaquita Gonzalez, wife of Patrick Gomes, the Inflight Supervisor on MH370.  \"We have been going through such a rollercoaster. When they first started the search we would hear that they saw something, and then our hopes would be up high. And then after that we would hear no, it's not MH370. And we landed back on ground. Each time it was as if somebody had stood on top of us and taken our breath away.\" From the start the Malaysian government was criticised by the families. First for its confused handling of the initial response, with blunders like the failure to act quickly on the military radar tracking of MH370. And later, for its apparent reluctance to authorise further searches, after the last operation by Ocean Infinity ended in mid-2018.  The company has offered to resume the search on a no-find, no-fee basis, but needs the government's approval. Privately some Malaysian officials acknowledge that the government could have done more. Some of this can perhaps be explained by the country going through a period of extraordinary political turmoil in recent years. Then there was the pandemic, a huge distraction which also prevented the families from holding their annual commemoration. The current transport minister, Anthony Loke, sought to address this by attending the 10th anniversary event in Kuala Lumpur, and promising the families he would do everything possible to find the missing plane. He announced that he was now discussing with Ocean Infinity the possibility of resuming the search later this year. Ocean Infinity scanned an area of 112,000km, back in 2018. This though, encompassed some extremely challenging terrain, like deep underwater canyons, and it is possible it might have missed the aircraft. Retired British aerospace IT specialist Richard Godfrey, another person who has been pulled into the MH370 vortex, believes he has now pinpointed a much smaller search area, using innovative analysis of short-wave radio test transmissions made routinely by ham radio enthusiasts. This should allow a more concentrated search by the drones, making several passes over the same area. \"They record 1.7 billion records a year in their database. Imagine a huge fisherman's net, across the globe, full of radio signals. Every time an aircraft passes through this net, it breaks a hole in the net. That tells me where an aircraft was at a particular time. Over the six hours of MH370's flight into the southern Indian Ocean I have been able to find 313 anomalies in the radio signals at 95 different points in time. That gives you a much more refined flight route, and a more accurate determination of a crash location.\" Richard's method is currently being tested by the University of Liverpool, which expects to establish how valid it is later this year.  The families say they are encouraged by the latest promises made by the transport minister - a much-needed change of tone from the Malaysian government, they say. But they remain wary. Their hopes have been raised many times before. \"I just want the plane to be found,\" Ms Gonzalez says. \"At least then I can let my husband rest in peace. Right now, I have not done anything for him, you know, to give him a memorial. I can't, because we don't have anything tangible from him.\" At the commemoration a large board had been put up, on which people could write messages, of hope, of sympathy, or of grief. Li knelt down to write a message to Yanlin in large Chinese characters, and then sat in tears, looking at it. \"Son, it's been 10 years\", he had written. \"Your mum and dad are here to bring you back home. March 3rd, 2024.\" Why Planes Vanish: The Hunt for MH370 Ten years after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 and its 239 passengers and crew vanished, can new evidence help locate the plane and finally solve aviation's greatest mystery?

            "title": "Boeing: Aviation giant displays crisis management at Asia's top airshow",
            "text": "As the aviation industry gathers this week for the Singapore Airshow there is no shortage of military hardware made by US aerospace giant Boeing. Spectators have been treated to displays by the F-15 fighter and Apache attack helicopter. However, conspicuously absent from the event are Boeing's commercial jets. Instead, attendees of Asia's biggest airshow have to make do with models of Boeing's passenger planes or can step inside an \"immersive display\" of the Boeing 777X cabin.  And as the event was in full-swing, Boeing announced that the leader of the troubled 737 Max programme Ed Clark would leave the company. It's Boeing's first major aviation event since a cabin panel detached mid-flight from a brand new Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 in January. In a preliminary investigation of the Alaska Airlines incident, US regulators found four critical bolts - meant to hold the so-called door plug in place - were missing. It led the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to order a temporary global grounding of the aircraft.   The planes are now flying again but the FAA said it will not yet allow Boeing to expand production of its best-selling narrow body family of jets, which includes the 737 Max 9. In contrast, Boeing's arch-rival Airbus took to Singapore's skies with its A350-1000 passenger jet. In its latest earnings report, the European aerospace giant said it would deliver 800 planes this year, including its A320neo which is a competitor to Boeing's 737 Max. Since the Alaska Airline incident, Boeing orders have shrunk significantly, delivering just 27 planes in January, compared to 67 in December. After the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) preliminary investigation into the the Alaska Airlines incident , Boeing's president Dave Calhoun said, \"whatever final conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.\"  \"There is no message or slogan to do that. It will take transparency and demonstrated action - that starts with each of us along with a commitment to listening to each other and speaking up,\" he added. At the Singapore Airshow, Boeing marketing executive Dave Schulte said the plane was \"by far the most scrutinised\" and \"safest\" in the world, adding that he had flown on one with his family the previous week. Some of Boeing's biggest customers have voiced their frustrations with the company, with the boss of Emirates airline warning that Boeing is in the \"last chance saloon\" after a \"progressive decline\" in its performance.  This is not the first time Boeing has faced a safety crisis.  In 2018, the 737 Max 8 was grounded after two fatal crashes off the coast of Indonesia and over Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019. All together, 346 people were killed.  Those crashes were attributed to flaws in its flight control software, forcing both airplanes to make catastrophic dives, despite the best efforts of the pilots.  Boeing's biggest challenge is regaining the trust of both the buyers of its planes and those who fly on them, with editor of Asian Aviation magazine Matt Driskill saying it would be \"really hard\" for Boeing to earn back trust.  However, a powerful voice in the industry says he is confident that Boeing will take the right measures and regain its status as a world-class supplier of aircraft. \"Boeing has responded in the right way. They have taken ownership of the problem. They put their hands up. They acknowledged that there is a problem that they need to address and I think they're going about that in the right way,\" Willie Walsh, the head of global airline industry body IATA told the BBC. The Singapore Airshow also saw the unveiling of another competitor for Boeing's airline customers - Chinese state-owned planemaker Comac.  At the event's press preview day, the Comac C919, a rival to Boeing's 737 Max and Airbus' A320neo single-aisle jet families, made its international debut. The C919 started flying in China last year and the airline China Eastern placed an order for 100 of them, marking the largest order yet of the plane.  However, some aviation analysts say it will not be a serious international contender for quite some time due to slow production and the need to gain regulatory approval to fly outside China. Another concern is parts. The C919 may be made in China, but it relies heavily on international supply chains.  \"The majority of the parts that go into the plane are from the West. The engines, the engine controls, the in-flight entertainment, just about every component is made in either Europe or America.\" Mr Driskill said. Boeing is also keen to emphasise the 737 Max's prominent position in the airline industry, highlighting that somewhere in the world one of the planes takes off every 16 seconds. Greg Waldron, Asia Managing Editor of online aviation website FlightGlobal, points out that despite the latest safety problems Boeing remains hugely important to the global commercial aviation and defence industries. \"Not to mention that there's a federal political importance with Boeing as well, because of the sheer numbers of people it employs, \" he said. \"So is it too big to fail? It certainly is.\"",

            "text": "The leader of Boeing's troubled 737 Max programme is to leave the company, which has been under pressure since a piece of one of its jets blew out during a passenger flight in January.  The departure of Ed Clark after nearly 18 years at the firm is part of a wider shake-up of the commercial airplane division announced on Wednesday. Boeing said the changes were aimed at improving its quality and safety. It comes as the firm prepares to meet with regulators. The company has been facing scrutiny since the incident on the Alaska Airline flight, which did not lead to serious injuries but forced an emergency landing. The incident revived wider questions about manufacturing processes for Boeing's popular 737 Max planes, years after crashes involving a different version of the jets in 2018 and 2019 killed 346 people and led to a global grounding for 20 months.  Boeing was barred last month from expanding its 737 Max output by the Federal Aviation Administration, while the authority reviewed its production line for the planes. Other less serious flaws have troubled production in recent years as Boeing ramped up manufacturing following the grounding. A preliminary investigation of what went wrong on the 737 Max 9 jet flown by Alaska Airlines found that bolts meant to fasten the door panel were missing, after being removed inside Boeing's factory in Renton Washington. Ed Clark was vice president and general manager of the 737 programme, overseeing the Renton, Washington factory that produced the plane involved in the blowout. Calls followed from safety campaigners for new leadership at the firm.  He will be replaced by Katie Ringgold, currently vice president of 737 delivery operations. The company also announced it was creating a position of senior vice president for quality. In a message to staff on Wednesday, Stan Deal, the head of Boeing commercial airplanes division said the changes were aimed at \"ensuring that every airplane we deliver meets or exceeds all quality and safety requirements. Our customers demand, and deserve, nothing less\". He said Mr Clark was leaving with the company's \"deepest gratitude for his many significant contributions over nearly 18 years of dedicated service to Boeing\".",

            "text": "A decade after MH370 disappeared, are we any closer to finding the missing plane? Amateur investigators are convinced they know its location. Ten years ago, on 8 March 2014, Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing with 239 people aboard \u2013 and was never seen again. One decade later, the fate of the plane remains unsolved, and its tragic disappearance has become one of aviation's biggest and most captivating mysteries since Amelia Earhart's plane disappeared. In the aftermath of MH370's disappearance, a massive search ensued that continued for four years and cost millions of dollars. Even after official recovery efforts ended, amateur sleuths continued trying to locate the ill-fated plane, which disappeared from radar less than 40 minutes into the flight. But is the mystery of what happened to flight MH370 any closer to being solved, ten years on? Or at least the mystery of where the plane's wreckage might be located? Some of the searchers who have been trying to solve this case for the past decade say: yes. Richard Godfrey, a retired British aerospace engineer and creator of the site The Search for MH370, who's dedicated much of the past 10 years to that question, is convinced it would only take one more search in the right location to find MH370. Separately, Vincent Lyne, a former researcher from the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) at the University of Tasmania, who's published numerous papers on the topic has also been conducting his own independent investigation and is certain that the location of the plane is not a mystery. \"The precise location of MH370 is in a very deep 6000-metre hole about 1500 kilometres west of Perth and along the longitude of Penang,\" says Lyne. \"That location reconciles all evidence.\" But how did Godfrey and Lyne each grow so sure about the plane's exact location when years of official searches have turned up nothing? Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 left Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 12:41 a.m. on 8 March 2014, and was scheduled to arrive in Beijing Capital International Airport at 6:30 am local time. But what happened next has baffled analysts. The plane was last heard from when pilots on the flight communicated with air traffic controllers in Kuala Lumpur to indicate that the plane was moving into another country's airspace en route to Beijing.  \"After 40 minutes, it disappeared from civilian radar,\" Alessandra Bonomolo, director of a new documentary on the disappearance of MH370, Why Planes Vanish: The Hunt for MH370, said on a recent BBC podcast.  \"There had been communications a few minutes prior between the pilots and air traffic controllers in Kuala Lumpur who exchanged a brief conversation, which is entirely customary when they say that they are going to move on to a different airspace \u2013 [which] in that case would have been the Vietnamese airspace,\" Bonomolo explains on the podcast. \"And after that 'goodnight,' the air traffic controllers in Malaysia know that they are no longer responsible for that plane because it entered another nation's airspace.\"\u00a0 It was at the border of Malaysian and Vietnamese airspace that the plane disappeared and stopped communicating with air traffic controllers entirely, says Bonomolo. And that's where the mystery begins. As the state of registry for the aircraft, Malaysia was responsible for searching to find the missing plane. But at the request of the Malaysian government, the effort was led by the Australian Transportation Safety Bureau (ATSB). The search began on 17 March 2014, according to a report from ATSB, and continued for 1,046 days, wrapping up on 17 July 2018. The voluminous report later issued by ATSB added more pieces to the puzzle surrounding what MH370 did after signing off with air traffic controllers on that fateful night, indicating that \"subsequent analysis of radar and satellite communication data revealed the aircraft had actually continued to fly for a further seven hours. Its last position was positively fixed at the northern tip of Sumatra by the surveillance systems operating that night, six hours before it ended the flight in the southern Indian Ocean.\" Beyond that, says the report, searchers had very limited concrete information surrounding the whereabouts of the plane. The surface and underwater searches that were conducted covered several million square kilometres and amounted to the largest search in aviation history, says the report. And yet the plane was never found. The mystery surrounding flight MH370 is further deepened by the debate over what caused the plane to go missing. Was it hijacked? Did it experience mechanical failure? Or perhaps its pilot, 53-year-old Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, was somehow involved in what took place. These theories and more were widely circulated in media reports in the initial months and years after the plane disappeared, particularly the idea that Shah might have committed an act of murder-suicide. While Godfrey and Lyne do not work together or support each other's explanation of where the plane might be, both believe pilot involvement may not be off base. \"The captain had a flight simulator at home, where he simulated a flight to fuel exhaustion in the Indian Ocean,\" says Godfrey. The ATSB's final report confirms as much. The report says Shah's flight simulator had been used six weeks prior to 8 March 2014 to map a path somewhat similar to MH370's flight's route, taking off in Kuala Lumpur and proceeding \"up the Strait of Malacca, with a left-hand turn and track into the southern Indian Ocean\". But why would the pilot have decided to down his own plane, if that was the case? The answer may never be known, but the BBC documentary about MH370 (in which Godfrey appears), refers to reports about the mental health among airline pilots and significant incidence of depression that has been documented by some studies, as one potential motivation for a suicide mission. A study published by the journal Environmental Health, for instance, found that \"13.5% of 1430 pilots who reported working as an airline pilot in the last seven days at time of survey, met depression threshold\" while \"seventy-five participants (4.1%) reported having suicidal thoughts within the past two weeks\". \"If you ask the question, 'What was the motivation of the captain?' And there is no other motivation \u2013 he was well off, his relationships were sound, he wasn't about to get divorced\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 then you come back to his mental condition,\" says Godfrey. Working independently, Godfrey has continued his efforts to pinpoint the final resting place of the MH370 wreckage. Lyne has also been working on his own to do the same. Godfrey's effort has included studying what's known as WSPR signals of radio amateurs from the night of the plane's disappearance. Radio amateurs are constantly sending test signals and recording that signal data, something that's been taking place for decades. And here's why that data matters so much, he says: because when a plane flies through a radio signal, it disturbs the signal and from that disruption you can track the presence of an aircraft. \"So I went back to March 8, 2014 and downloaded all of the signals\" explains Godfrey. There are thousands of them, and I started from the last known point of MH370, defined by the radar, and tracked its path,\" explains Godfrey. \"The results from my tracking align exactly with the satellite data for MH370, and the Boeing data, and the oceanography data.\" All of that effort and more on Godfrey's part, including combining different data sets that were previously kept in separate domains, has brought him to the conclusion that the plane is resting 1,500 kilometres west of Perth, Australia. \"The MH370 crash location, defined by the WSPR technology, is within a circle with a radius of 30 kilometres and centred at 29.128\u00b0S 99.934\u00b0E,\" says Godfrey. \"This area is 1,560 kilometres west of Perth, Australia. It will only take one more search of this area and we will find MH370.\" Lyne meanwhile, has said the plane will be found west of Perth along the longitude of Penang. This location is significant because Penang was the pilot's hometown and the plane was found to have taken a detour to Panang in the hours after it went off course, perhaps so Shah could have a final look. \"Someone [on MH370] was looking at Penang. Someone was taking a long, emotional look at Penang,\" where the captain was from, explained Captain Simon Hardy, an experienced Boeing pilot, in 2015. Lyne believes the precise location of MH370 and its planned flight track was decoded from Shah's pilot simulator information. Similar to Godfrey, Lyne cites a great deal of information he has sorted through from 8 March 2014 that further supports his location theory, such as a 300 kilometre trail of cloud anomalies corresponding to the final flight track of MH370. \"This was from the pilot trying to hide by flying within the clouds, but instead left a long-lasting trail of highly visible anomalies in five independent satellite images from three satellite passes,\" says Lyne. \"There is only one person on that plane who could have masterminded that secret flight path and landing location that had personal significance in relation to being along the Penang longitude,\" says Lyne. The greatest challenge, Lyne believes, to ultimately finding the plane is that \u201cdue diligence\u201d surrounding any new theory or location proposed generally gets rejected by officials who are focused on continuing to search in a region referred to as the 7th arc. As ATSB documents explain, the 7th arc is an area \u2013 based on analysis of satellite data and drift modelling \u2013 that MH370 is believed to have reached when it ran out of fuel and began to descend. Lyne says the 7th arc is the wrong location because it's based on \"the impossible notion that a plane running out of fuel immediately suffers a high-speed gravitationally accelerated dive but with not even a shred of debris\" in the area. \"There is no competent international science review group, which I\u2019ve called to be established, to objectively assess all evidence and to recommend a new search strategy,\" adds Lyne. \"Instead [the] new search plan is exclusively extending out from the 7th arc or within a small poorly surveyed area, which one group claims is hiding MH370.\" There has been talk of more searches taking place to find MH370. Locating the wreckage would help resolve many of the outstanding mysteries and questions surrounding the doomed flight, perhaps most importantly, who was flying the plane when it disappeared and whether it was indeed the captain. \"We won't have enough evidence to stand up in a court of law and decide who is guilty until we find the wreckage and the black box in order to solve this mystery,\" says Godfrey. \"Finding the wreckage would also allow us to figure out who was in the cockpit. And doing DNA samples from the skeletons in the cockpit would tell us who was there.\" \"Only then can we learn the lessons of this event in order to make aviation safer in the future,\" says Godfrey. Wherever the wreckage is located, it is likely sitting at least 3,000 to 4,000 metres underwater, in a deep, dark and very cold environment \u2013 one that's ideal for preserving evidence, says Godfrey, even ten years after the fact. -- If you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

            "text": "Late last year, the Spanish government fined 25 Spanish-flagged fishing ships that had been operating near Argentina's territorial waters. The financial penalties were imposed because the vessels had illegally turned off the GPS-based automatic identification systems (AIS), which were transmitting their positions. This is often a sign that a vessel is engaged in illegal fishing. \"It's estimated that illegal or unregulated fishing is as much as 20% of what's caught,\" says David Kroodsma, head of the research team at Global Fishing Watch. Such illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing may catch as much as 26 million tonnes of fish every year, or one in every five fish, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. It says that in financial terms this black market is worth up to $23bn (\u00a318bn). This contributes significantly to overfishing, with the UN adding that a third of global fish stocks are now being fished beyond biologically sustainable levels. For example it's estimated that the population of bluefin tuna, is just 2.6% of its historic, unfished size. \"Sharks and rays are at the brink of extinction,\" says Mr Kroodsma. \"You have extinction threats to sea birds and turtles from bycatch. It is really sad, because we could manage the oceans so much better.\" Global Fishing Watch was co-founded by Google, marine conservation body Oceana, and environmental group SkyTruth. The latter studies satellite images to spot environmental damage. To try to better monitor and quantify the problem of overfishing, Global Fishing Watch is now using increasingly sophisticated AI software, and satellite imagery, to globally map the movements of more than 65,000 commercial fishing vessels, both those with - and without - AIS. The AI analyses millions of gigabytes of satellite imagery to detect vessels and offshore infrastructure. It then looks at publicly accessible data from ships' AIS signals, and combines this with radar and optical imagery to identify vessels that fail to broadcast their positions. And while not all ships are legally required to use AIS, the AI and its \"fishing detection algorithm\" aims to work out which of these \"dark\" vessels are likely to be engaging in fishing. \"We use information like the length of the vessel, plus environmental information as to where that vessel is located, the imaging of the area, the density of vessel traffic in the area, the state of the ocean, like the temperature - a bunch of information on where the vessel is operating,\" says Fernando Paolo, Global Fishing Watch's senior remote sensing machine learning engineer.  \"And this model infers whether the vessel is likely a fishing vessel or not a fishing vessel, like passenger vessels, oil tankers, shipping vessels and that kind of stuff.\" The researchers have found that three quarters of the world's industrial fishing vessels are not publicly tracked, with particular hot spots around Africa and South Asia.  Global Fishing Watch is now working to introduce higher-resolution imagery to help spot more smaller fishing vessels. However, stamping out illegal fishing means getting data as quickly as possible - and a project from the University of Southampton and local firm RS Aqua is aiming to do just that. The team is building a submarine robot that uses underwater sensors and AI to identify the sound of fishing, and transmit the information in real time. The AI can already differentiate between the natural sounds of the ocean, and is now being trained to identify the noise of trawlers operating in protected waters.  \"Part of the drive of the project is to try and put something in place that would help monitor fishing activity within marine protected areas [MPAs],\" says University of Southampton professor of statistical signal processing Paul White. \"There's a definite concern that by creating these ecosystems with higher densities of fish, those are going to be attractive to fishermen.\" Read more stories on artificial intelligence Currently there are around 15,000 MPAs around the globe, which account for 8% of the world's oceans. Yet one study says that less than half are actually \"fully protected\" from fishing. Mr White says the aim is that if the robot senses fishing, it will automatically contact authorities who can send out a patrol vessel. He adds: \"Exactly what form of AI we're going to use, we've not completely fixed on yet. Part of the problem is that for this to work it has to sit in the ocean for many months. You can't put something out in one week and then have to go back and change the batteries. \"It's got to be very power efficient, which means you can't have very complicated algorithms running, but they need to be sufficiently powerful to distinguish something like trawler noise from other sources of noise in the ocean.\" Paul Lansbergen, chair of the International Coalition of Fisheries, says that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) \"is a scourge of the industry\". \"The sustainability impacts and economic damages are very real, but it's also no longer an issue that persists in the shadows. Industry leaders, policy makers, and associated stakeholders are all focusing on the challenge. \"Emerging technology, like AI, is complementary to traditional law enforcement and placing IUU in the cross hairs. But consumers also need to make sustainable choices and make it tougher on IUU fishers. We all play a role.\"",

            "text": "Set in a stunning valley, this ancient desert oasis has birthed flourishing civilisations. Now, after years of being closed to outsiders, it's starting to reveal its secrets. As a photographer, I've always been drawn to the unique way that light in the desert stretches, bounces off the sand and rock and illuminates the plains. There is a stillness in these landscapes that I've come to crave, but I'm also fascinated by the relationships people build with deserts. In the Middle East, humans have found ways to survive and even thrive in these harsh environments for millennia, and perhaps nowhere is this ingenuity more evident than in one of the Arabian Peninsula's most significant cultural cradles: AlUla (sometimes written \"al-Ula\").\u00a0 Set in the AlUla Valley amid the soaring sandstone and granite mountains of north-western Saudi Arabia's Hijaz region, this ancient desert oasis has supported human life for the past 200,000 years. The area's fertile soil and access to water amid the arid, mountainous desert helped multiple civilisations blossom. The Dadan and Lihyan kingdoms that flourished here between 800 and 100 BCE were followed by Hegra, an important city in the Nabataean civilisation whose capital, Petra, was located farther north, in modern-day Jordan.\u00a0 Yet, it wasn't until 2019 when Saudi Arabia began issuing tourist visas for non-religious travel that foreign visitors were able to witness this long closed-off and unexplored valley. Today, echoes of AlUla's long and mysterious past are everywhere, and as archaeologists slowly begin to uncover the many burial mounds, tombs and rock inscriptions scattered throughout AlUla's numerous sites, this ancient oasis is finally starting to reveal its secrets. Rock-carved kingdoms and ancient messages A stone-built city prospered in the AlUla Valley as early as 800 BCE. Dadan, the capital of the eponymous Dadan and later Lihyanite kingdoms, quickly became popular as a major trading hub for frankincense en route to Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean.\u00a0 The Dadanites developed their own script, and today these inscriptions \u2013 some of which are more than 2,500 years old \u2013 are preserved remarkably well at the nearby site of Jabal Ikmah, which is often called \"AlUla's open-air library\". These etched messages range from simple graffiti to elaborate records documenting offerings to the gods. The long-lost Nabataeans By the 1st Century BCE, the Nabataean civilisation from the southern Levant (modern-day Jordan) had expanded into north-west Arabia. While Petra remained the kingdom's capital city, the Nabataeans' most important city to the south was Hegra \u2013 Saudi Arabia's first Unesco World Heritage Site.\u00a0 For some 200 years, skilled masons worked inside Hegra's necropolis on majestic monuments like Qasr al-Farid, an unfinished, yet beautifully preserved tomb which, according to inscriptions, likely belonged to a prominent member of Nabataean. Hegra's sprawling 1.6-hectare archaeological complex contains 111 tombs that travellers to AlUla can visit today. One of Hegra's largest tomb clusters, Jabal Al-Banat (pictured), contains 29 tombs commissioned by or dedicated to women. It was another outcrop like this, called Jabal Ahmar, where the tomb of Hinat was found. Hinat, a local woman, was wealthy enough to have a tomb made for her and her 80 descendants. Alongside human remains, textile and leather were excavated, giving archaeologists a better glimpse into Nabataean life. In 2023, a team of scientists wrapped up a months-long project of reconstructing Hinat's face which now greets visitors at Hegra Visitor Center. Old Town  In the centuries after the Nabataeans vanished, the valley became home to a number of villages, but it wasn't until Islam arrived in the 7th Century CE that the oasis once again became an important stopover \u2013 this time for worshippers on the pilgrimage route to the Islamic Holy City of Makkah. Settlements here soon started thriving anew \u2013 the most famous of which is Ad-Deerah, known as \"AlUla Old Town\", which was built around the 10th Century using some of the same stones the Dadanites and Lihyanites used a millennium earlier. Filled with tightly packed mudbrick houses, shops, mosques, squares and a defensive fort, the town was continuously inhabited for more than 800 years until the 1980s, when the government relocated residents to the nearby modern town of AlUla in order to preserve the original settlement as an open-air museum. Today, the Old Town is a maze of abandoned homes, ceramics and embroidery workshops, and shops where travellers can buy artisan wares and dates from AlUla's surrounding groves. AlUla's many secrets  In addition to Saudi Arabia being largely closed off to outsiders for centuries, parts of AlUla remained off-limits to all Muslims \u2013 including those in Saudi Arabia \u2013 until recent years because of a belief that it was \"cursed\" by the Prophet Muhammad and therefore \"haunted\".\u00a0Yet in an attempt to shed light on the many civilisations that once thrived here, a team of researchers began conducting the first in-depth archaeological survey of the area in 2019. Since then, a string of remarkable discoveries has rewritten our understanding of human history in the Arabian Peninsula.\u00a0 More than 1,600 Neolithic stone monuments called mustatils (rectangles in Arabic) have been uncovered in the AlUla region, revealing that people already thrived here some 7,000 years ago. In 2021, a team of archaeologists discovered evidence that people here were domesticating dogs as early as 4,000 BCE. And in 2023, the world's largest prehistoric axe, a 51cm tool from 200,000 years ago, was found just south of the AlUla oasis.\u00a0 \"The archaeological findings of the last few years are rewriting our understanding of this area,\" said Dr Rebecca Foote, Director of Archaeology and Cultural Heritage Research for the Royal Commission for AlUla. \"We are getting a rich picture that the towns and cities of the AlUla Valley were dynamic, with people living in multiple places at any given time.\" Ingenious desert engineering  Ancient humans in AlUla used sophisticated engineering to prosper in this parched landscape. Beginning in the Dadan kingdom, area residents constructed massive cisterns and wells to both collect rainwater and access underground water aquifers. By the early Islamic period, a system of irrigation canals called qanats carried water from the foot of the mountains into the fields using gravity and precise calculations of slope. This skillful management of available water has helped AlUla become an agricultural hub, growing dates, citrus, figs and even wheat and barley. Today, native date palms (pictured) continue to dominate the landscape, with 2.3 million trees producing more than 90,000 tonnes of dates each year. A green oasis AlUla's date industry provides the foundation for the rest of the area's agricultural production: in the shade of its millions of date palms, citrus trees produce oranges, lemons, grapefruit and kumquats. Beneath the trees, farmers grow herbs like mint and basil. The Moringa peregrina, a tree praised for its cosmetic and medical properties, is cultivated nearby.\u00a0 Each January, the AlUla Citrus Festival brings together the region's farmers, shoppers and visitors during the harvest season, when more than 15,000 tonnes of citrus are collected and sold. Natural wonders In addition to its remarkable human history, the AlUla Valley is also filled with dramatic natural wonders, like desert canyons, sandstone cliffs, wind-carved rock formations and volcanic landscapes. North-east of the AlUla oasis, the 1,500sq km Sharaan Nature Reserve is home to Nubian Ibex, gazelles, red-necked ostriches and the elusive Arabian wolf.\u00a0 In the Ashar Valley (pictured here), giant ochre sandstone formations are the setting for AlUla's new hospitality scene, with several hotels, restaurants and even a concert hall hiding among the rocks. Surreal shapes  Jabal AlFil, or Elephant Rock (pictured here), is one of AlUla's most prominent landmarks. This imposing sandstone mountain soaring 52m into the sky has been moulded into an elephant-like shape by wind and water erosion over millions of years. Seeing Jabal AlFil from above on a helicopter ride helped me appreciate just how vast \u2013 more than 22,000sq km \u2013 this valley is, and how much of a welcome sight this oasis must have been for weary travellers centuries ago. Whimsically shaped natural creations are scattered elsewhere throughout AlUla, too: in Hegra, the Face Rock bids farewell to the setting sun while Sharaan Nature Reserve is home to the Dancing Rocks, two tower-like sandstone structures that seem to move in unison to an inaudible tune. Messages in the mountains The freestanding rocks and cliffs in the AlUla region are home to more than 50,000 messages from the past, from Neolithic petroglyphs depicting hunting scenes to Nabataean tomb inscriptions warning visitors against entering and stealing property. These messages provide a glimpse into the extensive human history of not only AlUla, but also the greater region. \"We have perhaps only found 10% of the history in this valley,\" said Atif Albalawi, one of the official r\u0101w\u012b, or storytelling guides, in AlUla. \"On almost every cliff and mountain, you can find either ancient inscriptions or a drawing that was made thousands of years ago.\" Alongside this prehistoric rock art, contemporary artists make their mark, too. Throughout AlUla, giant installations (like the one pictured) merge into the landscape, turning AlUla into a living museum of human expression through the ages. Reflecting the past In 2019, a contemporary mirage rose up from the desert in AlUla's Ashar Valley. This is Maraya, the world's largest mirrored building, covered with 9,740 glass panels that reflect the towering cliffs around it. Part art project, part gathering space for cultural events and concerts and part ultramodern conference centre, Maraya is the symbol for what AlUla always has been and aspires to remain: a destination at a crossroads attracting different people and ideas in the midst of an ancient land.

            "text": "A historian has created a new podcast defending her hometown of Milton Keynes. Anouska Lewis, 26, was born in the Buckinghamshire city and is the presenter of BBC sounds podcast Hometown Boring. She said it was only when she went to university \"it really hit home with how supposedly boring Milton Keynes is\". Through her podcasts she wanted to explore places that may not have \"cool reputations\" like her hometown. \"I wanted to make a history podcast that was relatable and light-hearted and fun, but also educational,\" she said. \"But I also wanted to spotlight places that have a similar reputation to Milton Keynes, ones that often get dismissed instead of being a cool city like Liverpool or Manchester.\" Hometown Boring is made up of six episodes that visit towns such as Slough, Plymouth and Chepstow in Wales. Each podcast highlights lesser-known history from the featured area in a bid to demonstrate how interesting the location really is. In Milton Keynes Ms Lewis explored the city's involvement in 1990s rave culture. She spoke to DJs who performed at the Sanctuary Music Arena, which closed in 2004 but would attract people from across the country. Ms Lewis was surprised to discover the city's rave history. \"When people [who are into rave] think about their teenage years they think Milton Keynes,\" she said. The podcaster said when she first returned to Milton Keynes from university she was surprised by how \"comforting\" she found the town. Ms Lewis said: \"I realised how comforting the dual carriageways and the greenery around the roads was, which is so weird.\" The Milton Keynes resident said she often feels protective of her hometown when it is \"misjudged or dismissed by others\".  She said there is a lot to love about the city and praised the \"innovative design\" of the town as well as the \"hippy\" shopping centre. \"I have got to give a shout-out to the roundabouts, I low-key love the roundabouts,\" she added.

The family-run bakery, which is currently home-based, said it was \"incredibly excited\" to be taking the next step.  Writing on the bakery's website, founders Charlotte Lee and Daniel Perry revealed their plans. \"We\u2019re incredibly excited (and of course a bit scared!) to be taking this exciting new step,\" they wrote.

The business, which the couple started last year, is named after their children and Ms Lee's grandmother, who was a baker in Coventry in the 1950s. Planning documents revealed the shop and adjoining flat would be brought back into viable use after an extended period of being vacant.

            "title": "Ryanair warns of 10% fare rise as new Boeing planes delayed",
            "text": "The boss of Ryanair has said holidaymakers will face higher fares this summer due to new Boeing planes being delivered late. Chief executive Michael O'Leary said the delayed delivery of the planes will constrain capacity for passengers. He said that Ryanair's ticket prices could be up to 10% more expensive this summer as a result. Ryanair hopes to get some compensation, but is focused on getting planes delivered, Mr O'Leary added. He said that a delivery of 57 Boeing 737 Max 8200's was due by March, but the firm thinks only 40-45 may arrive in time for the summer season. Boeing has been facing scrutiny since an incident in January when a piece of one of its jets blew out during a passenger flight. The Alaska Airline passenger flight did not lead to serious injuries but forced an emergency landing. As a result, Mr O'Leary said, the US manufacturer had the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, \"crawling all over them\". Major concerns have been raised about quality control for new Boeing aircraft, sparking a slowdown in production speed. Mr O'Leary said costs saved through hedging on fuel would mean that Ryanair's fare increase would not be as steep as the 17% rise seen in 2023. Some other airlines also have capacity constraints caused by aircraft not being available, he added. A problem with Pratt & Whitney engines, for example, has grounded a number of Airbus planes used by carriers such as Wizz Air.  Mr O'Leary told reporters that there would be a \"higher fare environment across Europe\" this summer.  Ryanair's original forecast for the year to the end of March 2025 was that it would carry 205 million passengers, up from 183.5 million in the 12 months before. Speaking at the firm's Dublin headquarters, Mr O'Leary said: \"With less aircraft, maybe we'll have to bring that 205 million down towards 200 million passengers.\" \"If capacity was growing, I think fares would be falling,\" he added. Lucy Coutts, investment director at JM Finn, told the BBC's Today programme: \"Boeing itself has said there are going to be 9,000 fewer seats this summer available because of the delays at the company. \"Ryanair is a low-cost carrier and so its hikes of 10% are a little bit higher than the average at 3-7% but it is because it is coming from a low base.\" Discussing the issues that have engulfed the US plane maker Boeing, Mr O'Leary described the message he was currently getting from the firm as \"confusion\". The boss of the carrier has repeatedly backed Boeing's top management, but criticised the plane maker's quality control standards. He does not think the removal of the 737 Max programme's boss Ed Clark was the right move, arguing that having both a replacement for Mr Clark and a new president for quality did not make sense.  Ryanair, he said, wanted one person in charge who was monitoring the situation daily, having previously said their products were \"great aircraft, it's just that they're not making them on time or delivering them in time\". A spokesperson for Boeing said: \"We are communicating with customers that some delivery schedules may change as we take the necessary time to make sure that every airplane we deliver is high quality and meets all customer and regulatory requirements.  They added that they \"deeply regret the impact this is having on our valued customer Ryanair\".  \"We're working to address their concerns and taking action on a comprehensive plan to strengthen 737 quality and delivery performance.\"",

            "title": "China's ageing population: A demographic crisis is unfolding for Xi",
            "text": "Ask 72-year-old farmer Huanchun Cao about his pension and he reacts with a throaty cackle. He sucks on his home-rolled cigarette, narrows his brow and tilts his head - as if the very question is absurd. \"No, no, we don't have a pension,\" he says looking at his wife of more than 45 years. Mr Cao belongs to a generation that witnessed the birth of Communist China. Like his country, he has become old before he has become rich. Like many rural and migrant workers, he has no choice but to keep working and to keep earning, as he's fallen through a weak social safety net.  A slowing economy, shrinking government benefits and a decades-long one-child policy have created a creeping demographic crisis in Xi Jinping's China. The pension pot is running dry and the country is running out of time to build enough of a fund to care for the growing number of elderly.  Over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. This is the country's largest age group, nearly equivalent to the size of the US population.  Who will look after them? The answer depends on where you go and who you ask. Mr Cao and his wife live in the north-eastern province of Liaoning, China's former industrial heartland.  Vast swathes of farmland and mined hills surround the main city of Shenyang. Plumes of smoke from smelting factories fill the skyline, alongside some of the country's best-preserved world heritage sites from the Qing dynasty.  Nearly a quarter of the population here is 65 or older. An increasing number of working-age adults are leaving the heavy industries hub in search of better jobs in bigger cities.  Mr Cao's children have moved away too but they are still close enough to visit often.   \"I think I can only keep doing this for another four or five years,\" Mr Cao says, after he and his wife return from collecting wood. Inside their home, flames crackle beneath a heated platform - called a \"kang\" - which is their main source of warmth.  The couple make around 20,000 yuan (\u00a32,200; $2,700) a year. But the price for the corn they grow is going down and they cannot afford to get sick. \"In five years, if I'm still physically strong, maybe I can walk by myself. But if I'm feeble and weak, then I might be confined to bed. That's it. Over. I suppose I will become a burden for my children. They will need to look after me.\" That is not the future 55-year-old Guohui Tang wants. Her husband had an accident at a construction site and their daughter's university education drained her savings.  So the former digger operator saw an opportunity in elderly care to fund her own old age. She opened a small care home about an hour from Shenyang. The pigs and geese both honk a welcome at the back of the single-storey house surrounded by farmland. Ms Tang grows crops to feed her six residents. The animals are not pets - they are also dinner.  Ms Tang points to a group of four playing cards as the sun shines through the small conservatory.  \"See that 85-year-old man - he doesn't have a pension, he's relying entirely on his son and daughter. His son pays one month, his daughter pays the next month, but they need to live too.\" She is worried that she too will have to depend on her only daughter: \"Now I will pay my pension every month, even if it means I cannot afford to eat or drink.\" For generations, China has relied on filial piety to fill the gaps in elderly care. It was a son or daughter's duty to look after ageing parents. But there are fewer sons and daughters for ageing parents to rely on - one reason is the \"one-child\" diktat which prevented couples from having two or more children between 1980 to 2015. With rapid economic growth, young people have also moved away from their parents, leaving a rising number of seniors to look after themselves or rely on government payments. But the pension fund could run out of money by 2035, according to the state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences. That was a 2019 estimate, before the pandemic shutdowns, which hit China's economy hard. China may also be forced to raise the age of retirement, which has been on the cards for years. It has one of the lowest retirement ages in the world - 60 for men, 55 for white-collar women and 50 for working-class women.  But economists say this is just tinkering around the edges if China is to avoid what some fear could become a humanitarian crisis in 25 years. Meanwhile, more and more elderly have been dipping into their pensions. \"Welcome to my home,\" beckons 78-year-old Grandma Feng, who only wanted to use her last name.  It's hard to keep up with her as she races along the corridor to warn her husband that guests are on the way to their room at the Sunshine Care Home. The morning exercise class, where she had been giggling and gossiping at the back with her friends, just ended.  The home was built to house more than 1,300 residents. Around 20 young people volunteer to live here for free in return for helping to look after some of the elderly. Private companies partly fund the home, taking the pressure off the local government. This is an experiment as leaders hunt for solutions for an ageing China. Here in Hangzhou, in southern China, they can afford such experiments.  This is a different world from Liaoning - the shiny new buildings that are rising up host tech companies such as Alibaba and Ant, a magnet for ambitious, young entrepreneurs.  The Fengs have been here for eight years. The nursing home seems friendly and there is plenty to do - from gym and table tennis to singing and drama. \"It is very important to be able to finish the last part of life at a good place,\" Grandma Feng says. She and her husband have been married for more than 50 years. It was love at first sight, they say.  When their grandson graduated from junior high school, they decided their task was complete. \"There are few people of the same age who think like us,\" Grandma Feng says. \"It seems we care more about enjoying life. Those who don't agree think it's unnecessary to pay a lot of money to live here while they have their own house.\" But she says she is more \"open-minded\":  \"I thought it through. I just gave my house to my son. All we need now is our pension cards.\" The couple's room at the care home costs around 2,000 yuan a month. As former employees of state-owned companies, they both have enough of a pension to cover the cost.  Their pension is far higher than the average in China, around 170 yuan a month in 2020, according to the UN's International Labour Organization. But even with clients with decent pensions, the Sunshine Care Home is running at a loss. The director says care homes are costly to start and take time to turn a profit.  Beijing has been pressuring private firms to build daycare centres, wards and other age-care infrastructure to shore up gaps left by indebted local governments. But will they continue to invest if profits are far off?  Other East Asian countries such as Japan are also searching for funds to care for large numbers of elderly. But Japan was already wealthy by the time it had one of the world's largest ageing populations.  China, however, is ageing fast without that cushion. So, many older people are forced to make their own way - at an age when they should be planning their retirement. Fifty-five-year-old Shuishui found a new career in what is being called \"the silver-haired economy\" - an attempt to harness the buying power of middle-class seniors. \"I think what we can do is try to influence the people around us to be more positive, and to keep on learning. Everybody might have different levels of household income, but whatever circumstances you are in, it's best to try to be positive.\" Shuishui knows she is part of a privileged lot in China. But she is determined to hope for the best. The former businesswoman is now a newly-trained model.  On the sunny banks of the Grand Canal in Hangzhou, she and three other women, all over 55, are touching up their make-up and hair.  Each has chosen their own traditional Chinese outfit in red or gold - floor-length silk pattern skirts and short jackets lined with fur to keep out the spring chill. These glamorous grannies are modelling for social media.  They teeter precariously in high heels over the cobbled historic Gongchen bridge while trying to smile and laugh for the camera as a team of social media specialists shout instructions.  This is an image of greying gracefully that Shuishui is keen for the world to see, and she feels she is doing what she can to lift an ailing economy. But this image belies the reality for millions of elderly in China.  Back in Liaoning, the wood smoke rises from chimneys, signalling lunchtime. Mr Cao is stoking the fire in his kitchen to heat water to cook rice.  \"When I reach 80, I hope my children will come back to live with me,\" he says as he finds a saucepan. \"I'm not joining them in the cities. Their place has no lift and you need to walk up five floors. That's harder than climbing a hill.\"   For Mr Cao this is simply the way of things. He has to keep working until he cannot. \"Ordinary people like us live like this,\" he says, pointing to the fields outside which are still covered in frost. Spring will bring back the planting season - and more work for him and his wife. \"If you compare it with life in the city, of course, farmers have a tougher life. How can you make a living if you can't bear the toughness?\"",

            "title": "Chinese visitors allegedly barred from Airbus German military plane",
            "text": "Visitors from China have claimed they were banned from a German military plane at a recent airshow, prompting an apology from manufacturer Airbus. The incident allegedly took place at the Singapore Airshow, one of the region's largest exhibitions of commercial and military aviation. The claims have gone viral on Chinese social media, sparking controversy. German officials have yet to comment. Airbus said it was sorry for \"any inconvenience caused\". In one widely-circulated video filmed by a Chinese blogger on the weekend, a woman wearing Airbus identification is seen asking him for his nationality.  The man was attempting to enter an Airbus A400M transport aircraft owned by the German air force, the Luftwaffe.  The woman tells him that she needs to check his nationality \"because it is a German aircraft\". When he tells her that he is Chinese, she immediately refuses him entry, saying \"it's German rules, it's military restrictions\". A BBC review found that several aspects of the video, including the planes seen in the background and the woman's ID, appeared genuine. Other Chinese visitors have also claimed online that they were not allowed on the plane.  Another blogger said he was chased away by German military staff, and that he had lodged an official complaint with the airshow's organisers alleging \"discrimination against Chinese people\". Commenters on Weibo pointed out that Chinese visitors were allowed to visit other countries' military aircraft, and lambasted Airbus and the German military. When approached by the BBC, a representative at the German embassy in Singapore referred reporters to Airbus as they were \"responsible for security and managing the entrance\" to the plane. He did not respond to questions about the allegations regarding German military staff. Airbus declined to comment on the video. But the European plane manufacturer told the BBC they were aware that some visitors at the Singapore Airshow had \"raised questions about access\" to the A400M plane.  \"We immediately communicated and coordinated with the customer and our Airbus teams at the show to ensure that the aircraft was open to all visitors for the remainder of the airshow. We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused,\" they said. Airbus posted a similar apology on its official Weibo account. The BBC has also contacted the airshow's organisers and the Chinese bloggers for comment. Airbus touts the A400M as the most advanced \"airlifter\" military transport plane available. It can deliver troops into small unprepared airstrips in the battlefield as well as send large equipment to bases, while also acting as a mid-air refuelling tanker. The incident comes amid increasing European concern of Chinese state access to Western military technology. The President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen last year warned against European technology enhancing China's military capacities. Additional reporting by Fan Wang.",

            "text": "A popular boxing club has said it is losing its venue because the special school which owns the building needs the space to help more pupils. Aspire Boxing Club's current home is on the site of the Sheffield Inclusion Centre in Arbourthorne. Former boxer Ronny Tucker, who runs the club, said he would have to look for alternative venues. The school said a record number of children were being excluded and it needed the space. The club had trained at the local authority site since 2017 and Mr Tucker said the gym kept many young people off the streets. \"They're not involved in crime, they're not in their bedrooms - they're here,\" he said. Charlie Wild, who has been training at the centre for six years said it was a \"really special place\". \"As a woman in boxing this means everything to me,\" she said. \"If you're here and want to learn they'll give you everything.\" Former professional boxer Johnny Nelson said closing the gym was \"detrimental to the community\". \"There's no youth clubs left. It's not just a club, it's a community centre. It's a safe place for young people to go,\" he said. A rising number of children, aged five to 16, were being excluded permanently from mainstream schools prompting a need for more teaching space, a spokesperson from The Sheffield Inclusion Centre said. It agreed with Sheffield City Council to take on 50 extra pupils, bringing the total number of students to 300. However, many children are being taught at other, privately-owned sites. \"The rates charged for the private bases are often inflated and the children are educated away from the main campus which is far from ideal,\" a spokesperson said. The school said the club's contract ending was a solution to that issue and the club had been informed the lease would not be renewed last summer. Sheffield City Council said while it owned the building day-to-day running of the site was the responsibility of the school's governing body. A spokesperson added: \"Sheffield Inclusion Centre is accommodating a growing number of children with complex needs, and is working with ourselves as the local authority to meet these children's needs.\" Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

            "text": "Two very different flights in 24 hours, each with the same aim: to alleviate Gaza's suffering. The first is the less perilous: an Etihad Airways passenger plane, flight EY750 from Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates. The Boeing 777 has been converted into a virtual flying ambulance with seats in economy turned into hospital beds. Its mission, paid for by the government of the UAE, is to return civilians who had previously got out after being trapped in Rafah in southern Gaza, in some cases for months, and to evacuate wounded Palestinian children who had crossed from Gaza to al-Arish in Egypt's northern Sinai. After hours on the ground, the first evacuees start to make it on board. There is relief on their faces as they make it across the airfield to the plane, but uncertainty too. Many have left family members behind in Gaza. Among them is 58-year-old Hanaa Hasan Abu Namous. Her hand is badly injured. She says 25 members of her family were killed in an Israeli air strike on their home in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. \"During the war they were displaced,\" she tells me. \"Thirty or 50 of them would come to our house. We are civilians. We never have and never will fight.\" She holds a picture on her phone of shroud-wrapped bodies. They had to be buried together, four or five to a coffin, she says. Sitting a few rows forward is 13-year-old Yazan Wajih Barhum, whose left foot has been partially amputated. He was at a neighbour's house in Rafah when an Israeli bomb hit, he says. His seven-year-old brother, Yamen, was hit with shrapnel in the eye and is already in Abu Dhabi. When I ask him when they last saw each other he answers, quick as a flash, \"58 days ago\". What are his hopes for the future, I ask. \"To be able to walk on my legs again, get back to how I was, play football with my friends, and for the war to end so I can go back to my country\", he says. The crew on board, regular airline staff, hand the 25 injured children backpacks with games and a SpongeBob blanket. The kids who are able sit watching cartoons on the entertainment system; some are on stretchers at the back of the plane. Kiran Sadasivan, the cabin manager, welcomes the children and their chaperones on board, taking pictures with their phones and distributing meals. \"This is my tenth mission flight,\" he tells me. \"And I'll be on the next one in a few days.\" Also on board is Dr Maha Barakat, the UAE's assistant foreign affairs minister. A UK-trained doctor, she does not rest during the 20-hour evacuation mission, checking on the patients and medical team and liaising with the Egyptian authorities on the ground. \"The actual day today was clearly a more challenging day than usual,\" she says. \"There was a particular girl that we were trying to get through - she was in urgent medical need. And she wasn't able to make it to the border. However, we will have another plane coming in the next few days.\" Not all the Palestinians on the plane are leaving Gaza. Sitting alone, wearing a dark red headscarf and with a small leather handbag at her side is mother-of-three Zahra Mohammed Al-Qeiq. She has leukaemia, and left Gaza a few months ago for treatment in Abu Dhabi. Now she is returning to Rafah.  Isn't she scared, I ask her. \"The whole period I spent in the Emirates, my kids were crying on calls asking me to come back, saying 'come back; we will die in Gaza'. I had to stop my treatment and go back to my children,\" she says. Emirati doctors have given her six months of chemotherapy drugs. \"I cried every night I was away from home. I have to go back, they are my children,\" she says. Twenty-four hours later, a Royal Jordanian Airforce cargo plane - \"Guts Airline\" painted on its side - heads for Gaza at sunset. The aircrew on board have done this flight a dozen times. As they reach 17,000ft (5,200m), they put on oxygen masks and make final precise adjustments for the drop. For the first time, the cargo on board is British: four tonnes of supplies, including fuel, medical gear and food rations, to resupply the Jordanian-run field hospital in Gaza City. Until now Britain has only sent aid by land and sea, but northern Gaza has become almost entirely unreachable. The World Food Programme has suspended deliveries there because its convoys have endured \"complete chaos and violence\", it said. There is a heavy Israeli military presence on the ground. The Jordanian authorities will not disclose what co-ordination is made with Israel to allow the plane to fly overhead without incident. Israel maintains a tight grip on the aid going into Gaza. Britain and others have complained that only a fraction of the aid needed is making it into the strip. Everything is subject to stringent Israeli checks, to prevent supplies making it inside that would aid Hamas. Most of the people in this once densely packed part of Gaza have been driven out by Israeli forces, but some 300,000 remain, barely surviving in the most desperate of circumstances. The UN has been warning for months of the threat of famine in northern Gaza. I watch as the cargo doors opened and the first two pallets of supplies fly off into the black night. The plane banks sharply and turns, and the second two pallets are launched. The Jordanian crew give a thumbs-up and head for home. It is a small drop in the chasm of Gaza's need. But this aid sent into the night at least manages to get through; the crew confirms it has landed right on target.",

            "text": "What is it like to only be able to celebrate your birthday once every four years? Far from missing out, many so-called leaplings say there is something special about being one of the rare people born on 29 February. Julia Alsop will blow out seven candles on her birthday cake this year - she is going to be 28. When she tells people she will be celebrating her seventh birthday in 2024, she says they look at her as if to say: \"'What on Earth are you talking about?'\" And then it clicks.  Julia, a medical student from Warwickshire, is a leapling. She was born on 29 February, an elusive day that appears once every four years in a leap year - so she's only had seven birthdays on her actual day in her lifetime. Leaplings are rare. There is about a one in 1,461 chance of being born on 29 February.  Julia loves that her birthday is different, and this year is looking forward to opening her seventh birthday cards on her actual big day. In a non-leap year, when she has no official day to celebrate on, she instead plans a week of festivities. There can be some technical difficulties involved in being a leapling, says Julia. When taking out a new phone contract, she failed the credit check because 29 February didn't appear as a date on the system.  She says that was \"really frustrating\". \"They made it seem like my birthday didn't exist.\" Sometimes the dropdown boxes on online forms will only list 28 days for February, says Jane Atkin, a primary school teacher from London.  She is turning 15 (or 60) this year.  \"Quite often I have to put in 28 February, which rankles, because that's not my date of birth,\" she says of the problematic dropdown forms. But being a leapling does feel special because it is so unusual, says Jane. A few years ago, when it was her eighth and ninth leap year birthdays, the 10 and 11 years olds in her class thought it highly amusing that they were older than their teacher, she recalls.  Author, Patience Agbabi, has written a series of children's fictional books about a young leapling who possesses the special gift of being able to leap through time. Jane says she contacted Patience on social media ahead of attending a book reading and signing with the author. \"She replied to me,\" says Jane, \"and said, 'I'm so excited that you're coming. Normally when I do a talk about my books, I ask if there are any leaplings, and there never are'.\"  When she was younger, Jane's mother chose to mark her daughter's non-leap year birthdays on 28 February. But as she got older, Jane began to also celebrate on 1 March - because \"why not?\" she adds. Abi, from Surrey, is two (or eight) this year. She made the decision last year to celebrate her birthday on 1 March, as she realised 28 February didn't make sense - she wouldn't have been born yet. Abi's mother, Jo, recalls a conversation she had with a midwife at the hospital when her daughter was born. \"I said, 'Oh, it's very quiet in here', and one of the midwives said, 'Nobody wants a leap baby'.\" Not always being able to celebrate on her actual birth date has been difficult for Abi to understand, says Jo. But she definitely wouldn't change her daughter's date of birth now. \"She's very special and I think it really suits her,\" says Jo. \"I always say to her, you'll change the world Ab. She's a unique kid.\" Abi is planning to celebrate this year in style. \"I will have a sweetie cake for my birthday party at the family, and then, with all my friends, I will have another sweetie cake,\" she says.  What is a leap year and why do we have them?  Joe Middleton, from Leicestershire, is turning eight (or 32) this year. He says he is extra lucky around his leap year birthdays, winning competitions in the past. He now works in property, but trained as an actor, and says his colleagues often joke that he is the youngest member of the team - even though he's not.  As a student, Joe's unusual birth date would often confuse the bouncers at a nightclub when they asked to see his ID. With his youthful face, his birthday meant he had a lot more explaining to do before they would let him in. On a non-leap year, he usually celebrates on 28 February, but often keeps the festivities going into 1 March as well. \"Facebook, for example, gets confused and tells people that my birthday's on both days,\" says Joe. \"It doesn't really know where to place me. So then I get messages from friends and relatives on both days because people don't really know which day I'm celebrating on.\" Rather than missing out on birthdays, he wants more people to know leaplings get double the opportunity to celebrate - and that being in this special club is \"a gift\".",

            "title": "Lockbit: UK leads disruption of major cyber-criminal gang",
            "text": "The UK has led an operation to disrupt what is thought to be the world's largest criminal ransomware group.  The National Crime Agency (NCA) has infiltrated systems belonging to Lockbit and stolen its data. The organisation is believed to be based in Russia and, by volume, be the most prolific ransomware group selling services to other criminals. On Monday evening, a message appeared on Lockbit's website, saying it was \"now under control of law enforcement\". The operation is being billed as one of the most significant disruptions of the cyber-criminal world. The FBI, Europol and other countries have also been involved in the long-running operation but it is the first of its kind to be led by the UK.  Criminals use Lockbit to hack into computers belonging to companies and organisations and lock users out until a ransom is paid. They often also steal data and threaten to release it. The group emerged around 2019 and has established itself as a dominant player. Some estimates suggest it holds around 20-25% of the market for ransomware. Among the high-profile reported targets of Lockbit are Royal Mail, which was hit in January 2023, disrupting international deliveries. Last November, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) was also hit with major repercussions in the financial world. Others reported to have been hit include suppliers to the NHS, law firm Allen & Overy and Boeing, the aerospace company. The operation has been under way covertly for some time, with law enforcement gathering data before moving to a more public phase on Monday evening. The NCA's technical experts had been able to get inside of Lockbit's own systems and take control. In doing so, they were able to steal a large amount of the criminal group's own data about its activities. Since many companies do not admit they have been hacked and sometimes pay a ransom, this data may well provide a unique insight into the true scale of the group's work as well. As they moved into the more open phase of the operation, law enforcement went public about their infiltration. They took control of the site on the dark web, where Lockbit publicised its activities and replaced it with the emblems of the various law enforcement agencies and a message reading: \"The site is under the control of the National Crime Agency of the UK, working in close co-operation with the FBI and the international law enforcement task force, 'Operation Cronos'.\" At a press conference on Tuesday morning, the head of the NCA, Graeme Biggar, said it assessed the group was responsible for 25% of ransomware attacks in the last year. He suggested the incidents had led to losses totalling billions. He said there were thousands of victims globally, including 200 that were known of in the UK - though he added that in reality there may have been many more. Lockbit works by selling its criminal services, acting as a one-stop shop to customers known as affiliates. These affiliates pay to be able to carry out the hacking operations and receive both the malicious software and advice. But following the action by law enforcement, the affiliates who tried to log into the site were greeted with another message explaining that Lockbit's internal data was now in the hands of law enforcement, including details of victims, the amount of money extorted \"and much, much more\". The message adds: \"We may be in touch with you very soon.\" There have been so-called \"take-downs\" in the past but in many cases the criminal groups re-emerged soon after their online operations were disrupted by law enforcement, limiting the long-term impact. But in this case, those behind the operation are hoping to have a more significant impact by undermining the credibility of the group and attacking its reputation. The group relies heavily on branding. It has even paid people to have the Lockbit brand tattooed on their bodies. The aim is to sow distrust by making affiliates realise that law enforcement now has their details and drive a wedge between them and those who run Lockbit by making other criminals believe it is a risk to work with them in the future for fear law enforcement is watching. Those directly involved in the operation say they believe the UK will be significantly safer in the short and medium term from cyber-attack and describe the move as a 'step change' in the response to cyber-crime. \"On the face of it, this is one of the most consequential disruptions ever undertaken against one of the giants of ransomware, and certainly by far the biggest ever led by British police,\" Ciaran Martin, the former head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre told the BBC.  \"There are few, if any, bigger players than Lockbit in ransomware, and the NCA seem to have wholly 'owned' them, as we say in cyber security\", he added. Those behind the Lockbit group are believed to be based in Russia which means, like other similar groups, they are beyond the reach of law enforcement for arrest. That means disruption is often the only realistic option to try and undermine their work, as well as improving cyber-defences. When the FBI carried out a similar operation against a group called Blackcat last year, it resulted in a tussle over control of the site between the group and US law enforcement, a sign that these operations do not always go exactly to plan.  But the hope is that this operation, with its very public exposure of Lockbit's activities, will disrupt them enough to prevent a quick return.",

            "title": "The executive hubris driving five-day in-office mandates",
            "text": "Some high-profile CEOs are demanding full returns with a \"command-and-control\" mindset. In January, United Parcel Service CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 announced the international logistics company was cutting 12,000 of its 85,000 management jobs. Workers who weren't axed would be expected in the office five days a week starting March. For the corporate staffers who can perform some or all their duties from home, the mandate came as an ice-water bath. For employees like these who spend most of their days in front of a computer, workplace experts insist remote and hybrid work cannot easily be stuffed back into the bottle. \"It's become so much of a mainstay now,\" says Colleen Flaherty Manchester, professor in the work and organizations department at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management, US. We can't go backwards, she says. Years of post-pandemic data has shown remote and hybrid work works. Researchers have found employees retain productivity and can help companies drive profits. There are also the intangible factors that breed employee loyalty, such as better work-life balance. Throughout the past several years, many CEOs courting the idea of full office returns have pulled back due to this data and the strong pushback of their workers.\u00a0 Yet these factors haven't stopped a handful of companies, including some very high-profile employers, from issuing mandates \u2013 or at least heavy-handed, public suggestions \u2013 that corporate workers should be back at their desks five days a week. In finance especially, major institutions \u2013 including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup \u2013 have instituted five-day-attendance policies for many of its staff. Boeing, too, has taken the decision to require much of its corporate workforce back at their desks. Some data shows even more top brass are considering it, especially among large organisations. Some experts, including Stephen Meier, chair of the management division at Columbia Business School in New York, remain genuinely baffled why companies like UPS are putting up a fight over return-to-office. But he believes there's a common thread among many of these firms: hard-line management tactics. \"You can't continue that leadership style that you had before [the pandemic],\" he says. \"You need to actually empower [employees] \u2026 And, I think, some leaders are just used to a certain command-and-control model.\" This is true of many outspoken critics of remote work, such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who was one of the first to issue a \"show-up-or-quit\" ultimatum back in 2022. In a May 2023 interview with CNBC, Musk launched an expletive-laden attack on workers who wanted flexible set-ups, saying the \"laptop class\" was \"living in la-la land\".\u00a0 Nicholas Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford University, says Musk's attitude towards remote work goes beyond the company's needs. \"His life is his company,\" he says. \"If you're Elon Musk, you basically want to spend every minute awake and work. It's the place your mind focuses on. You love it. It's your career. It's your aspiration where all your money is invested.\" Some CEOs with this mentality expect the same of their workers: if I am back, you will be, too. This blunt-force, power-driven approach also showed up with JPMorgan Chase's CEO, Jamie Dimon, when he doubled-down on in-person work in July 2023. If employees wanted the prestigious organisation on their CVs, Dimon made clear they were to follow his mandate. \"I completely understand why someone doesn't want to commute an hour and a half every day. Totally get it\u2026 Doesn't mean they have to have a job here, either,\" he said. Beyond the cult of personality, some of these strong-armed mandates may be driven by a different type of desire for control \u2013 especially in the current uncertain economy, when corporate performance and earnings are shaky. Bloom points to a 2023 paper by two University of Pittsburgh Katz Graduate School of Business professors who examined 137 different return-to-office announcements over the past year. The research found managers use return-to-office mandates \"to reassert control over employees and blame employees as a scapegoat for bad firm performance\". Bloom says many CEOs who are leading companies in financial tumult feel pressure to make broad, sweeping \u2013 even \"desperate\" \u2013 changes to prove to shareholders they're shoring up the bottom line. He points to UPS's Tom\u00e9, whose company reported a steeper-than-expected revenue drop in their Q4 2023 earnings. \"The CEO has to stand up and say something, and has to take radical action,\" says Bloom, \"otherwise she's out of a job. This is what's going on.\" This kind of executive peacocking may convince some shareholders getting workers back in office will be a panacea \u2013 but experts say recalling employees could come back to haunt leaders. \"I think a couple of these Sun King CEOs like Elon Musk have this problem,\" says Bloom, a reference to French absolute monarch King Louis XIV. \"They're just out of touch with their employees, and they're not used to hearing no... And they just rammed this thing through, which is a bad decision.\" He continues, \"In the long run, performance is going to be improved by keeping employees happy, and reducing retention and recruitment costs. The research evidence shows quite clearly that for professionals and managers, hybrid is profitable for companies.\" Most companies will realise this, says Prithwiraj Choudhury, associate professor of business administration at Harvard Business School. He sees firms that have taken a hard-line on return-to-office as the exception. He believes many companies opposed to remote work will soon change their tunes. \"I think no company in today's world can enforce a policy that is anti-talent,\" says Choudhury. \"It's just not going to work. You're going to feel the pain. You're going to see some of your best people leave. And then there will be a course correction.\" Even prestigious firms, like JPMorgan Chase, may ultimately not be able to leverage their clout to snag and keep talented staff. Still, it doesn't mean every organisation will budge, especially as workers have lost some of their power in a tightening job market. Hubris is powerful \u2013 and in some cases, it may prevail, even at the expense of employee desire and data-driven logic.",

            "title": "Boeing safety checks to use 'more boots on ground'",
            "text": "The head of the US aviation regulator has said \"more boots on the ground\" will be used to step up safety checks on Boeing planes. Federal Aviation Administrator Mike Whitaker told US lawmakers on Tuesday that Boeing is being \"closely scrutinised\" after a door plug broke off one of its planes last month. No-one was seriously hurt in the mid-air blowout. But issues found in inspections since have raised questions about standards. Mr Whitaker told a congressional committee he would ensure aircraft manufacturer Boeing would be held accountable for any future failure or refusal to comply with the FAA. His comments came in the wake of last month's incident in which an unused door blew out of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max nine minutes after take-off from Portland International Airport. Although no-one was seriously hurt, the incident could have been much worse had it occurred later in the flight. Since then, loose bolts and fixings on other planes, revealed in aircraft inspections, have called into question Boeing's manufacturing standards. The airline manufacturer revealed this week that more defects had been found on parts of the fuselage - the main tube of the aircraft - which were sent to Boeing by its key supplier, Spirit AeroSystem. The FAA itself has faced criticism for allegedly failing to impose sufficient oversight on Boeing. Concerns were first raised in the aftermath of two catastrophic accidents affecting the 737 Max in late 2018 and early 2019, in which 346 people died. At the time, the aviation regulator was accused of allowing itself to be unduly influenced by the company it was supposed to be overseeing - so-called \"regulatory capture\". Last month's door blow-out has once again cast a spotlight on the work of the agency. Appearing before the House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee, Mr Whitaker said inspections of 737 Max aircraft had shown that \"the quality system issues at Boeing were unacceptable and require further scrutiny\". He pointed out that Boeing had already been prevented from expanding production of the 737 Max, and said the FAA had launched an investigation scrutinising Boeing's compliance with manufacturing requirements. Mr Whitaker added that the FAA was looking forward to the results of a comprehensive review of Boeing's safety culture being carried out by a panel including representatives of the FAA, labour unions, engineering experts and others. The FAA would \"follow the data and take appropriate and necessary action\", he said. \"Let me stress, the safety of the flying public is our mission,\" he concluded. Responding to questions from lawmakers, Mr Whitaker said the Alaska Airlines incident had created two issues for the regulator. \"The first is what's wrong with this plane? The second is what's going on with Boeing?\" he explained. \"They have had issues in the past, and they don't seem to be getting resolved.\" He said the FAA currently had about two dozen inspectors working in Boeing's factories, with another half a dozen at Spirit Aerosystems. However, he said no decision had been taken about the future of the ODA (Organisation Designation Authorisation), a system which allows Boeing to carry out some safety certification work itself on behalf of the regulator. In the past, this system has been described as Boeing \"marking its own homework\".",

            "text": "A door that blew away from a Boeing 737 Max shortly after take-off may not have been properly secured, a new report says. The US National Transportation Safety Board has released initial findings from its probe into the incident on an Alaska Airlines plane in January. It says four key bolts that were meant to lock the unused door to the fuselage appeared to be missing. Replying to the report, Boeing said it was accountable for what happened. In a statement, Boeing's president Dave Calhoun said: \"An event like this must not happen on an airplane that leaves our factory. We simply must do better for our customers and their passengers.\" \"We are implementing a comprehensive plan to strengthen quality and the confidence of our stakeholders,\" he added. The incident happened minutes after Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 took off, and involved a panel covering an unused emergency exit - known as a door plug. This suddenly blew out, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the main body of the aircraft, the fuselage. The missing bolts appeared to have allowed the door panel to move out of position and break away from the aircraft, the report says.  It happened just moments after the flight took off from Portland International Airport. The plane then suffered a rapid loss of cabin pressure, as air rushed out and the atmosphere within the plane equalised with the thinner air outside. The door plug was manufactured by Boeing's supplier Spirit AeroSystems, and originally installed in the fuselage before being delivered to the aerospace giant. According to the preliminary report, this door plug was later removed in the factory due to damage that had occurred during the production process. Photographic evidence suggests that when the plug was reinstalled, at least three of the four locking bolts were not put back in place. Damage to the door plug and its hinges, as well as a lack of damage to the areas where the bolts should have been, suggests that the bolts were missing before the door moved out of its normal position, the report said.  Spirit AeroSystems said it remain focused on working closely with Boeing and regulators \"on continuous improvement in our processes and meeting the highest standards of safety, quality and reliability\". The findings are likely to make uncomfortable reading for Boeing, which has already faced harsh criticism over its corporate culture and quality control processes. Inspections have already revealed loose bolts and fixings on other planes of the same specification, raising questions about the way they were built. However, the BBC understands with inspections into the in-service 737-9s almost complete, no models have been found to be missing any of the four retention bolts.  In his response, Boeing's president and chief executive said its improvement plan would \"take significant, demonstrated action and transparency at every turn\".  Mr Calhoun said the airline manufacturer would implement new inspections of door plug assembly and fully document when the plug is removed. Additional inspections into the supply chain and an independent assessment would also be included in the plans.  \"This added scrutiny - from ourselves, from our regulator and from our customers - will make us better. It's that simple,\" Mr Calhoun said. Prior to the Alaska Airlines incident, there had been other serious problems on the 737 Max production line, including the discovery of manufacturing defects affecting key parts of the planes, as well as a part protecting the central fuel tank against lightning strikes. The scrutiny is all the more intense because of the history of the 737 Max itself. The plane - a new version of Boeing's decades old workhorse - was involved in two major accidents in late 2018 and early 2019, in which 346 people were killed. Those crashes were attributed to badly-designed flight control software, which forced both aircraft into catastrophic dives that the pilots were powerless to prevent. In the aftermath, Boeing faced accusations from lawmakers and safety campaigners that it had put profits above the safety of passengers. Testifying before US lawmakers today, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Whitaker said inspections of 737 Max aircraft had shown that \"the quality system issues at Boeing were unacceptable and require further scrutiny\". He promised to put more \"boots on the ground\" in Boeing's factories in order to increase scrutiny of the manufacturer.  Boeing would be held accountable for any future failure or refusal to comply with the FAA, he added. Last month, Boeing's chief executive Dave Calhoun told staff at the company it would co-operate with investigators and regulators \"to ensure all the procedures are put into place, inspections, all the readiness actions that are required to ensure every next airplane that moves into the sky is in fact safe and that this event can never happen again\".",

            "text": "The boss of Emirates airline has warned Boeing is in the \"last chance saloon\", saying he had seen a \"progressive decline\" in its performance. Boeing has come under scrutiny after a panel on a 737 Max 9 passenger jet blew off mid-air last month. Emirates president Sir Tim Clark is a leading industry figure and the airline is a major Boeing customer. He also told the Financial Times that Emirates would send its engineers to monitor Boeing's production lines. In response to Sir Tim's remarks, Boeing pointed to comments its chief executive, Dave Calhoun, made last week, when he said: \"We understand why [customers] are angry and we will work to earn their confidence.\" Emirates told the BBC it had nothing to add to what Sir Tim said in the interview. \"They have got to instil this safety culture which is second to none. They've got to get their manufacturing processes under review so there are no corners cut etc,\" Sir Tim said. \"I'm sure Dave Calhoun and [commercial head] Stan Deal are on that... this is the last chance saloon,\" he added. Sir Tim was preparing to send Emirates engineers to monitor Boeing's production lines for the first time. He said the engineers would observe the production process of the 777 at Boeing and its supplier Spirit AeroSystems. Emirates is one of Boeing's biggest customers. In November, it placed an order for 95 wide-body Boeing 777 and 787 jets, used for long-haul flights, valued at $52bn (\u00a341.2bn) at list prices. But Boeing hit the headlines in recent weeks despite the Mr Calhoun insisting the company had changed since he took over after former boss Dennis Muilenburg was fired. On 5 January a door plug on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 blew off shortly after take-off, terrifying passengers, and forcing an emergency return to the Portland, Oregon airport. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) launched an investigation of Boeing's manufacturing process and barred the firm from expanding production of its popular 737 Max planes. Some of the company's biggest airline customers have also expressed concerns, noting that the issues may delay approval of new versions of the 737 Max plane, the Max 7 and Max 10, that are in the works. In 2018, a similar incident to what happened last month occurred to an older model of Boeing 737 being operated by Southwest Airlines. Debris from an engine failure broke one of the cabin windows while the plane was travelling at 32,000ft. It resulted in one passenger being partially sucked out of the window and she died from her injuries. The company's safety record has also been tarnished due to two crashes in late 2018 off the coast of Indonesia and in early 2019 outside Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa. A total of 346 people were killed in the crashes, which were caused by flawed flight control software.",

A Conservative MP has said politicians cannot be viewed as \"fair game\" after a large-scale pro-Palestinian protest at his family home. Tobias Ellwood, who represents Bournemouth East, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme the \"bar of acceptable treatment\" of MPs was falling. More than 60 people, some holding Palestinian flags, gathered at his home on Monday to call for a Gaza ceasefire. Dorset Council has approved plans to charge double council tax on second homes. Councillors agreed on Wednesday to implement a 100% premium for the properties. They also agreed to change the rules for unoccupied homes, bringing in a 100% premium after one year of the property being empty instead of two. Boxing world champion Chris Billam-Smith has become an ambassador for his local foodbank. The WBO cruiserweight title holder decided to lend his support to Bournemouth Foodbank after visiting its warehouse with his family in December. He hopes to raise awareness of the charity's projects, such as its baby bank, and help dispel the stigma some people associate with using foodbanks. Work to stabilise a Dorset riverbank has been completed. The bank of the River Stour in Sturminster Newton, which borders the A357, had been gradually slipping into the water. Dorset Council carried out works to stop any further movement, and protect the busy road nearby. Residents are urging councillors to vote against selling part of a seaside car park to build 72 homes.  Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council is considering plans to dispose of the south section of Beach Road car park in Poole.  BCP said the 316-space facility, which is about 100m (320ft) from Branksome Beach, had been \"underused\" for many years. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Last February's Delta Airlines flight DAL209 from Edinburgh to New York was diverted to Prestwick where it made an emergency landing. Footage emerged at the time on social media of flames around the aircraft's wing. The Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) said it was trying to understand the effect of engine vibration which led to a fuel leak. The plane landed safely at Prestwick and no-one was hurt. Passengers said they heard a loud bang before the aircraft was diverted. The AAIB has provided a short update on its investigation a year on from the incident. It said the Boeing 767 suffered an engine failure on take-off from Edinburgh Airport, and experienced \"airframe vibration\". The AAIB said once the jet had landed, fuel was seen coming from the right wing and passengers were rapidly disembarked.   It said: \"The investigation has been focused on understanding the effect of engine vibration which led to the fuel leak.   \"The investigation is ongoing, and the final report is expected to be published in early 2024.\"",

            "text": "Spirit AeroSystems has said it is changing some of the suppliers to its Northern Ireland operations as a cost cutting measure. It is unclear whether the cuts will have any impact on local suppliers. The move concerns the Airbus A220 because Spirit, a US-based company, makes the wings for that plane in Belfast. Airbus and Spirit are currently renegotiating financial terms for the A220 work. Speaking on Tuesday, Spirit's chief executive, Patrick Shanahan, said: \"The negotiations with Airbus continue and have been productive.  \"We hope to conclude by February, but we need to ensure all items are addressed.  \"We are converging on operational and financial solutions.\" Spirit has been in Northern Ireland since 2019 when it bought Bombardier's operations. The deal ended a long period of uncertainty for about 3,000 workers in Northern Ireland. Mr Shanahan told financial analysts that the firm was looking at cost savings from work coming out of the old Bombardier supply chain and going to Airbus suppliers. \"We've jointly evaluated those costs, and Airbus has a significant history with those suppliers. So I feel confident in that cost basis,\" he added. He was speaking as the firm reported financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024 which included another $58m (\u00a346m) of losses related to the A220. Spirit's US operation is the major supplier to the troubled Boeing 737 Max.  The company said it would not be providing investors with financial forecasts for the year ahead until there is clarity from regulators about when Boeing will be allowed to increase the production rate of the 737 Max.",

            "title": "Cardiff Airport continuing to make losses",
            "text": "Cardiff Airport is continuing to make a loss as it struggles to attract passengers back to pre-pandemic levels. It lost \u00a34.5m in the year to March 2023 according to company accounts, after receiving a government grant of \u00a35.3m. The company, which is owned by the Welsh government, is hoping to make more use of its land to raise money. The Welsh government said the airport is working to restore flights to the facility and diversify its business. Cardiff Airport said it facilitates 4,000 jobs related to aviation in the Vale of Glamorgan, where it is located. The accounts report the first full financial year after Covid travel restrictions were lifted, and the year that Wizz Air pulled out. Welsh government ministers are currently supporting the airport through a grant worth \u00a342.6m over four years. Over the years it has received millions in government loans. In 2021 Labour ministers wrote off a \u00a342.6m loan they had given the airport, leaving it to repay \u00a326.3m by 2045. Some 910,000 used the airport in the year to March 2023, which was 380% more than the previous 12 months. However it was only 58% of the figures from the last reported pre-pandemic year. The accounts record pre-tax losses for 2022-23 of \u00a34.5m. However Cardiff Airport also uses a different measure, EBITDA which records earnings before tax, interest and other items, to report on its financial performance. Using EBITDA Cardiff Airport said it reported a profit of \u00a3863,000 in 2022-23. It says its underlying losses fell by \u00a32.1m from the year before, when it received a \u00a37.9m grant.  Rather than just relying on passengers, Cardiff Airport is hoping to increase its income by making more use of its runway and land. The accounts say that the decision of Wizz Air to close its operations in early 2023 reinforces \"the need to ensure that dependence on passenger activities for the majority of revenues is reduced\". There were hopes Qatar Airways would recommence flying from Cardiff Airport by the end of last year, but it is yet to return to the airport. In an interview with Walesonline, Cardiff Airport Chief Executive Spencer Birns said there was a \"commercial negotiation taking place\" and the airport was working on a resumption with Qatar \"as soon as possible\". The Welsh Conservatives' Natasha Asghar said: \"We were told Qatar Airways were coming back in December, yet here we are in February and there is no sign of flights to Doha. \"Diversification of the airport has to be the utmost priority for Labour's Transport Minister, if more operators do not come on board Cardiff Airport's losses will only grow.\" A Welsh government spokesperson said:  \"We're committed to maintaining an airport in Wales because of the benefits it brings to the Welsh economy and its local supply chain.  \"The airport generates over \u00a3240m GVA to the Welsh economy, annually. The executive team continues to work hard to restore flights and diversify the business as part of its recovery from the pandemic. \"Commercial discussions remain ongoing between Cardiff Airport and the airline regarding the resumption of the Qatar Airways' Doha service from Cardiff.\" Mr Birns said Cardiff Airport drives \"over \u00a3246m of direct economic benefit to Wales annually\". \"We facilitate just over 4,000 aviation-related jobs in the Vale of Glamorgan, by ensuring safe and secure airport operations across both the Cardiff and St Athan airfields,\" he added. \"The largest employer, British Airways, has been operating from their maintenance centre in Wales for over 30 years.  \"The airport typically drives over \u00a3246m of direct economic benefit to Wales annually. It's a vital part of the nation's economic infrastructure.\" Ryanair is due to add routes to five destinations in the summer of 2024, he added.",

            "title": "Boeing chief admits 'serious challenge' ahead",
            "text": "Boeing faces a \"serious challenge\" and uncertain outlook as it seeks to restore confidence, its boss Dave Calhoun admitted, announcing the firm's latest financial results on Wednesday. Trust in the firm has been shaken since a panel of one of its 737 Max 9 jets broke off in mid-air. The incident has renewed questions five years after two fatal accidents on another version of its planes. Mr Calhoun has been trying to show the firm is taking the situation seriously. On a call with financial analysts, he apologised and said the company took responsibility, no matter what the ongoing formal investigation into what caused it concluded.  \"We caused the problem and we understand that,\" he said. \"We simply must do better.\" The quarterly update to investors is the company's first since the accident on the Alaska Airlines flight, which terrified passengers and forced an emergency return to the Portland, Oregon airport that occurred without serious injury.   Mr Calhoun has previously blamed it on a \"quality escape\". Reports suggest that the panel was improperly installed when the plane left Boeing's factory.  It has prompted new scrutiny of the company's manufacturing record, which critics say has suffered as the firm pushed to cut costs and speed deliveries. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has launched an investigation of Boeing's manufacturing process and barred the firm from expanding production of its popular 737 Max planes.  Some of the company's biggest airline customers have also expressed concerns, noting that the issues may delay approval of new versions of the 737 Max plane, the Max 7 and Max 10, that are in the works. Mr Calhoun said the company would defer to regulators.  \"I know these moments that can impact delivery schedules can frustrate our customers and investors but quality and safety must come before all else,\" he said. \"We are going to go slow to go fast and we will encourage and reward employees for speaking up to slow things down if that's what needed,\" he said. On the call with investors, Mr Calhoun limited his prepared remarks to the company's response to the Alaska Airlines emergency. The company also said it would not offer formal financial guidance for the 2024 year.  \"While we often use this time of year to share or update our financial and operational objectives, now is not the time for that,\" Mr Calhoun wrote in a letter to staff that accompanied the results.   Analysts pressed Mr Calhoun about what the turmoil would mean for the company in the years ahead, with one questioning how the lapse could have occurred after the spotlight that was cast on the company after crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving another version of its 737 Max plane killed 346 people. The issues have hit the company's shares which tumbled 20% at one point.  The Rhode Island treasurer on Tuesday filed a proposed class-action lawsuit on behalf of shareholders, accusing the company of continuing to prioritise \"profits over safety\" after those accidents, despite public promises to the contrary.  Boeing declined to comment on the lawsuit. Among airline safety campaigners, the emergency has sparked calls for new leadership and the ouster of Mr Calhoun, who has served on the board since 2009 and was installed as chief executive after the earlier crashes. \"They had their chance. They failed. They are unable or unwilling to do the task and should leave,\" said Michael Stumo, whose daughter was killed in the Ethiopia Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 crash and has now become a vocal airline safety advocate. The investor update for the September to December period showed the manufacturing giant was currently producing 737 planes at a rate of 38 a month. Revenue rose 10% to $22bn, while the company's losses in the quarter narrowed to $283m.",

The Pyramid Boxing Club moved into the top floor of Street Methodist Church in 2023, after outgrowing Pilton Working Men's Club. Reverend Colin Moore said the club had helped to fund the building's upkeep, saving it from closure. Angela Wittleton, who attends the club, said it had been a \"big surprise\" to see the space being used again. She grew up in the area and remembers how the church used to look. \"It had not been used for a few years. The heating had been turned off and it had been left to just fester really. \"I don't think I can put it into words how amazing it is to see the building being used again,\" she said. Club secretary and coach Nicole Miles said the church building was a \"lovely\" place to work. \"As you walk up the stone stairs you gradually hear the noise and then you open up the front door and then it hits you. \"We have such a wide range of people who come and attend and it's lovely, we enjoy teaching the real little ones right up through.  \"We're starting a Parkinson's disease group soon and we're looking forward to getting things off the ground for it,\" she said. Mr Moore said the boxing club's new base above the main hall had been \"quite a surprise, but a really happy surprise\".  He said: \"We were kind of under pressure as a church to keep the building and we needed to have a way of funding it.  \"We approached various organisations and came up with nothing. \"It came out of the blue when the boxing club approached us to use the space permanently.\" Mr Moore added: \"The big thing for us was the church being used again and being in contact with the community again.\" Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

            "text": "Alaska Airlines says it is facing a $150m (\u00a3118m) hit, after the dramatic mid-air blowout of a panel on one of its planes this month.  The 5 Jan incident on a Boeing 737 Max 9 plane terrified passengers and prompted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ground 171 jets with similar designs. Alaska had to cancel more than 3,000 flights in the wake of the incident. It said it expected its travel to return to normal by early next month.  But it warned that growth would be lower than expected in the months ahead, as deliveries of new Boeing aircraft are likely delayed.  The FAA on Wednesday said the grounded Boeing planes could return to service if they have been inspected. But Boeing's output has been capped, while the FAA investigates its manufacturing. The troubles at the company, one of the world's two major plane-makers, are now spilling over to the rest of the industry.  United Airlines, another major 737 Max 9 customer, earlier this week said it was braced for delays in deliveries and looking at alternatives to Boeing as it plotted out aircraft orders.  It warned investors that it would lose money in the first quarter due to the incident. Executives at Southwest and American, which are also reporting earnings this week, have also echoed the concerns about delayed aircraft and frustration with Boeing. \"Boeing needs to get their act together,\" American Airlines chief executive Robert Isom said.  Boeing for its part, has apologised for the disruption and pledged to work transparently and cooperatively with regulators.  Alaska Airlines had also faced questions from passengers, after it was revealed that the airline had restricted the jet involved in the accident from certain routes due to a pressure issue.  Chief executive Ben Minicucci said the problem was \"totally unrelated\". Speaking to financial analysts, he said passengers should feel confident in the safety of flying on its planes.  Mr Minicucci said he was having \"tough\" conversations with Boeing and would hold its \"feet to the fire\", but did not go so far as to threaten to cancel orders.  \"We have a longstanding deep relationship,\" he said, noting that the company had been happy with the planes in the past.  Boeing has been struggling with a spate of smaller manufacturing issues in recent years, while trying to repair its reputation after fatal accidents in 2018 and 2019 - involving a different version of the 737 Max - killed 346 people. Robert Mann, president of RW Mann & Company, an airline analysis and consulting firm in New York, said airlines used to have staff on hand to oversee more of the manufacturing process, but that they had scrapped that practice in recent decades in a drive to cut costs. \"As upset as these airlines are - and you can understand why they would be - they don't exactly have clean hands,\" he said.  Now, with the industry dominated by just two big players - Boeing and European rival Airbus - they are in \"a bit of a box\", he added.  They don't \"really have any alternative as a practical matter,\" he said. ",

            "text": "The head of Boeing is facing questions from lawmakers in Washington as pressure mounts to explain the mistakes that led to a panel breaking off one of its planes this month. Boss Dave Calhoun told reporters ahead of the meetings that he was prepared to share \"everything I can\". But he declined to comment on a report that said the part had been improperly installed at one of the firm's plants. The anonymous account was posted online and reported by the Seattle Times. The post, from someone claiming to work at Boeing, described the production of Boeing's 737 planes as \"a rambling, shambling, disaster waiting to happen\". It said the firm's records showed that the four bolts meant to hold the door plug in place were not installed when Boeing delivered the 737 Max 9 plane to customer Alaska Airlines. On 5 Jan, just eight weeks later, the panel blew off shortly after take-off, terrifying passengers, and forcing an emergency return to the Portland, Oregon airport.  No serious injuries were reported but lawsuits have been filed by customers since the incident, accusing the company of negligence. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has grounded 171 other 737 Max 9 planes with similar designs for inspection, forcing the cancellation of thousands of flights.  It also recently recommended airlines inspect Boeing's older 737-900ER models, which use the same door design as Max 9s, though it did not order the planes out of service.  The whistleblower account said Boeing should have halted 737 manufacturing due to an \"alarming\" number of issues surfacing on the planes during inspections. In the case of this particular plane, it said Boeing and Spirit staff at a Boeing factory in Washington worked to identify and repair issues ahead of the delivery. The whistleblower says that in the course of that work, the bolts were removed. But according to the post, a final inspection of the door never occurred, which the account blames on a breakdown in communication, in part due to Boeing's use of two different computer systems to report and sign-off on issues.  Boeing staff were the ones who removed the bolts, according to The Seattle Times, which said the information was from a different anonymous source.  Mr Calhoun referred questions to the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident.  Leaders at Alaska Airlines and United Airlines, which have two of the biggest 737 Max 9 fleets, have expressed major frustration with Boeing as the groundings create chaos and added costs.  In an interview with NBC News, Alaska Airlines boss Ben Minicucci said there was \"no doubt\" that the aeroplane came \"off the production line with a faulty door\". He said airline inspections since the incident found \"many\" loose bolts. \"I'm more than frustrated and disappointed,\" he said. \"I am angry.\" The comments underscore the difficult task ahead of Boeing to restore confidence among its airline customers and the flying public, which had already been shaken after fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving its planes killed 346 people. The FAA is currently investigating Boeing's manufacturing process and reviewing its current system for approving planes, which delegates some of those powers to Boeing.  Online travel agent Kayak recently reported that searches from users trying to avoid Boeing 737 Max planes had jumped 15-fold since the accident.  Mr Calhoun told reporters that he recognised the seriousness of the concerns. \"We fly safe planes - we don't put [aeroplanes] in the air we don't have 100% confidence in,\" he said. \"I'm here today in the spirit of transparency.\" The incident has drawn attention to other issues cropping up on Boeing planes, including the nose wheel of a different Boeing plane model, a 757, which popped off as it was lining up for takeoff in the US on Saturday.  None of the 184 passengers or six crew members were hurt when the wheel fell off the Delta Air Lines flight from Atlanta and rolled down a hill, the FAA said in a notice. The plane had been scheduled to fly to Bogota in Colombia, and passengers were put on a replacement flight, Delta Air Lines said. It apologised to customers, and said the \"event remains under investigation\". Boeing, which ended 757 deliveries in 2004, declined to comment on the incident. Responding to the ongoing situation with Max 9s, Boeing's Stan Deal, its chief executive of commercial aeroplanes, said the plane maker had \"let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers\". A spokesman said the firm had \"announced a series of immediate actions to strengthen quality\" including more inspections. Boeing has also named a retired US Navy admiral, Kirkland H. Donald, to lead a comprehensive quality review of its commercial aeroplane operation.",

            "text": "A major US airline has said it expects to lose money in the three months between January and March due to the grounding of Boeing 737 Max 9 jets. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded 171 of them after an unused door broke away mid-flight. United Airlines has 79 of the aircraft in its fleet, more than any other carrier, followed by Alaska Airlines. Both airlines have been forced to cancel hundreds of flights this month as inspections are carried out. United has said it expects the planes to remain grounded until 26 January and its forecast assumes it won't be able to fly them at all this month. The issues at Boeing, which is now facing government investigations of its manufacturing process, have also scrambled United's efforts to expand its fleet.  It warned investors on Tuesday that deliveries of dozens of new Boeing planes, including 737 Max 9s and a not yet approved Max 10, will be delayed. Chief executive Scott Kirby told analysts the firm has not cancelled its orders with Boeing but was considering alternatives. In an interview with CNBC, he called the latest grounding the \"straw that broke the camel's back\". Boeing has been struggling to restore confidence since fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving another version of its 737 Max plane that led to a global grounding for more than 18 months. Smaller manufacturing issues have cropped up repeatedly since production restarted.  Stan Deal, head of Boeing's commercial airplanes division, said the firm had \"let down\" its customers and was \"deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers\". \"We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance,\" he said.  The Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to Ontario, California, had reached 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began its emergency descent, according to flight tracking data, after the unused emergency exit door blew out. On Sunday, the FAA said another, older 737-900ER model should also be inspected as they use the same door design. United has 136 of these jets in its fleet. The FAA did not order the older model to be grounded while the visual inspections are carried out by operators. In the wake of the incident, Boeing said it would increase inspections and bring in an outside expert to review its processes, among other measures. ",

            "text": "Ryanair has cut its profit expectations for the year to the end of March, after some online travel agents stopped selling its flights.  The airline reduced fares to fill seats in December after it said sites including Booking.com, Kiwi and Kayak suddenly removed its flights.  Ryanair said it expected profits of up to \u20ac1.95bn (\u00a31.7bn), down from its forecast of up to \u20ac2.05bn in November.  A sharp increase in the airline's fuel bill has also hit profits.  In the October to December quarter, its fuel costs jumped 35% to \u20ac1.2bn. In January, Ryanair hit out against a number of online travel agents, including Booking.com, Kiwi and Kayak, after it said its flights had been suddenly removed from their websites.  Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers has been in a long-running dispute with online booking sites, after the airline launched legal action in the US against Booking.com owner Booking Holdings and its subsidiaries including Kayak, Agoda and Priceline. It followed an Irish High Court ruling which banned screenscraper Flightbox from gathering Ryanair flight information for online travel agents. The airline said the removal of its flights from the websites would increase the number of empty seats on its planes in the short term, and it dropped its direct booking prices in response.  In its latest set of results, Ryanair predicted an after-tax profit of between \u20ac1.85bn and \u20ac1.95bn for the year to the end of March, lower than a forecast of between \u20ac1.85bn and \u20ac2.05bn it made in November.  It said its revenue per paying passenger had been weaker than the previous year, blaming it on the removal of flights from online travel agents, despite its passenger numbers and fares being higher.  However, the airline's chief financial officer, Neil Sorahan, told the Reuters news agency that the impact of being removed from some online agents' sites would be temporary and was already beginning to \"fizzle out\". The after-tax figure would still beat its previous record annual after-tax profit of \u20ac1.45bn in 2018, and follows a boom in profits for the airline in November, after the airline hiked prices. Ryanair said passenger numbers had risen 11% to a record 105.4 million in the six months to September, despite average fares rising by 24%. The airline warned that the possibility of further delays in the delivery of new, more fuel-efficient Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft could also affect profits.  It also added that its full-year result remained heavily dependent on \"avoiding unforeseen adverse events (such as the Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas conflict)\".",

The US Federal Aviation Administration grounded more than 170 of the 737 Max 9 fleet after a cabin panel broke away thousands of feet above the ground. On Sunday, the agency said airlines should also inspect older 737-900ER models, which use the same door design. The FAA described the move as an \"added layer of safety\". It said there had been no reported issues with the 737-900ER, but that it uses the same style of panel to \"plug\" an unused door as the plane involved in the terrifying 5 January incident.  An Alaska Airlines flight en route to California from Portland, Oregon was forced to make an emergency landing after the panel came away, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the aircraft. The incident prompted the FAA to ground all 737 Max 9s featuring that style of panel and sent Boeing's share price tumbling. The agency is investigating the firm's manufacturing practices and production lines, including those linked to subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems, which provided the panel. Earlier this week, the FAA said it had carried out inspections on 40 of the grounded planes but did not say when they would be able to fly again. In a statement on Sunday, the agency said: \"The safety of the flying public, not speed, will determine the timeline for returning these aircraft to service.\" Boeing has said it will increase the quality of inspections in its manufacturing process in wake of the incident. The 737-900ER models have carried out 11 million hours of operations without similar incident to the newer 737 Max 9s. The FAA did not order the older model to be grounded while the visual inspections are carried out by operators. ",

            "text": "With the top contenders for the US presidential election in 2024 both well past the typical retirement age, science says there is both pros and cons to having older leaders. Pauline Newman, currently 96, holds a lifetime position as a US federal judge. Though she wants to carry on working, she's in the midst of lawsuits with colleagues who want her to retire. The US has become a hotspot for debates about whether people in the political sphere can ever be too old to lead. The top contenders for the 2024 US presidential election are Joe Biden \u2013 who turned 81 in 2023 and is more than twice as old as the median American; and 77-year-old Donald Trump, who is a more than a decade beyond the \"Normal Retirement Age\" \u2013 the age at which Americans can receive their full retirement benefits. In the US Senate, Republian Chuck Grassley is the oldest sitting senator at the age of 90, followed by Senator Bernie Sanders at 82. The spotlight on Biden's age increased in intensity in February 2024 when Special Counsel Robert Hur described the US President as \"an elderly man with a poor memory\" in a report on a year-long inquiry into Biden's handling of classified files. The White House has described the report as \"inappropriate\". Apart from discussions of the fact that gerontocracies \u2013 societies governed by older people \u2013 are typically not representative of their population, there are other concerns. One key focus is mental fitness. Neuroscience and psychology suggest that cognitive performance varies widely as people grow older, making it tricky to determine whether someone can be too old to lead. And while some skills tend to decline with age, others improve. Some \"super agers\" even possess the mental acuity of people many decades younger than themselves. So, how old is \"too old\" to lead \u2013 or is this the wrong question? Brain volume diminishes over time. In healthy people, the prefrontal cortex is the region of the brain with the most age-related volume loss, of roughly 5% per decade. Through its connections to other parts of the brain, it helps manage executive function: a complex set of mental processes that has been likened to a thermostat or the conductor of a symphony. It's key to discussions of leadership capacities because it's involved in areas like problem-solving, goal-setting and impulse control. Executive function declines gradually during a person's 30s, and this accelerates as we enter our 70s. White matter disease \u2013 a group of conditions caused by damage to the white matter in the brain \u2013 also contributes to executive dysfunction, and affects about a third of people aged 65 and older. Executive dysfunction can show up in reduced impulse control and increased repetition of thoughts and behaviours. A significant proportion of people over 65 have some impairment of executive function, \"I think as a general break point, 65 is reasonable,\" says Mark Fisher, who directs the Center for Neuropolitics at the University of California, Irvine. Other structural changes in the brain become solidified around this age as well \u2013 mental processing speed has been shown to decline from around the age of 60 in a study using US data.\u00a0 You might also like: The very loose threshold of 65 applies to the US, where the overall life expectancy at birth is 76. However, it may be different in countries with markedly different life expectancies and health systems (and there is also substantial racial and other inequality within the US that affects longevity). For example, the life expectancy for men in the US is 73. This is lower than in the top countries, but much higher than the life expectancy of 60 for men in Cameroon, whose president, 90-year-old Paul Biya, is said to be the world's oldest national leader. Life expectancy at birth doesn't tell the full story of longevity, as this number is brought down by factors like infant mortality. For example, an 80-year-old in the US could expect to live another decade. This means that in reality, there is no hard and fast rule for when, or even if, a person will be significantly affected by the decline of executive function \u2013 particularly when you factor in that we don't all have the same proficiency to begin with.\u00a0 \u00a0 Fisher explains that in general, averages can obscure expectations of healthy longevity and cognitive fitness, given what he calls the \"tremendous individual variability\" in executive function. \"The battery of testing would be the best way to formally determine one's executive function, but there is going to be wide variation in terms of how individuals function,\" Fisher says. One differentiator is comorbidities: multiple conditions like heart disease, high cholesterol, and hypertension (high blood pressure). All of these can impact brain function, particularly executive function. And while ageing does not always come with illness, it makes it more likely. According to Fisher, \"hypertension is, probably along with ageing itself, the most important, most impactful factor on brain ageing as a whole and executive function as well\". Thus, early diagnosis and treatment of hypertension is an important area of intervention to protect brain health. And positively, this is an area where treatments and knowledge are regularly improving, Fisher says. There's also variation in which parts of the brain can compensate for others that show some age-related damage. While the brain is generally very plastic, and many of us can partially make up for disruptions in one part of the brain by enlisting other parts of the network, others will experience a failure of compensation along the lines of Alzheimer's disease, explains Mark Mapstone, a translational neuroscientist at University of California, Irvine. However, it's not all bad news. There are some aspects where older brains actually show better performance. While the ability to take in new information declines much earlier, the ability to direct and act on information can improve well into a person's 70s. So, while 70-year-olds will probably process new information more slowly than 30-year-olds, they may do better at synthesising it. Mapstone says that 60-year-olds typically have better vocabulary than 20-year-olds, and can thus substitute words better. For example, one study found that vocabulary scores increase until a person's mid-60s.\u00a0 \"What happens with older brains is they get better at what is called crystallised intelligence,\" explains Rose McDermott, who specialises in political psychology at Brown University. \"You have these kind of established schemas and ways of thinking about things. And you're able to integrate new information into existing structures much more readily and in many cases creatively than you can when you're younger because you don't sit on the same degree of knowledge base.\" Some people, known as \"super agers\", retain the cognitive functions of much younger people. These are people in their 80s and older with the cognitive health of those two to three decades younger. Super agers show larger, healthier neurons in the entorhinal cortex, a part of the brain critical to memory. Unsurprisingly, they do better on memory tests than their peers.\u00a0 Physical activity, mental stimulation and social connection are all important to preserving brain tissue and brain function. Political leadership certainly provides at least the mental challenge and social connection parts, and powerful people are also likely to have many privileges, including financial security and access to excellent healthcare. Some scientists consider leaders like Biden to be super agers. However, while ageing presents some cognitive challenges in general, it may present extra issues for political leaders. \"Cognitive flexibility in thinking and problem solving is an essential form of cognition for political leaders to excel at in order to make good-quality decisions under uncertainty and risk,\" notes Barbara Sahakian, a professor of clinical neuropsychology at the University of Cambridge. \"These types of decisions are also often time limited.\" However, cognitive flexibility usually dwindles over time. Some mental changes associated with age could be particularly alarming to voters. For one thing, it appears that brain ageing can affect political attitudes. A novel study by Fisher and colleagues, of Southern California retirees with a mean age of 95, found that while political ideology remained consistent overall over a six-month period, people with cognitive impairment showed inconsistency between their political orientation and policy choices. Fisher comments of this finding: \"It does appear to be that this is a consequence of cognitive impairment, that one's political behaviour becomes relatively unanchored from one's stated policy.\"\u00a0 However, \"neuropolitics\", the combined field of neuroscience and political science, has its critics. Some disability scholars argue that it's simplistic to find biological explanations for political behaviours, for instance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Given the evidence of the effects of ageing on the brain, Fisher and some colleagues from different disciplines are calling for cognitive screenings for politicians, which would not necessarily depend on age. \"We view cognitive screening as something analogous to the financial disclosures that politicians are often expected to make,\" he says. Cognitive function is mainly assessed through a neuropsychological evaluation \u2013 a set of standardised tests that can be so detailed and extensive that they are spread out over several days, Mapstone explains. Manijeh Berenji, an occupational medicine specialist and member of the clinical faculty at UC Irvine, believes that these assessments of politicians can be feasible and fair. However, the concept is highly controversial and politicised. Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley has been leading calls for politicians over the age of 75 to undergo mental competency tests. But the approach has been criticised as ageist and difficult to implement. At the start of 2024, Haley went further by launching an series of politcal adverts that focused on Biden's and Trump's ages, including one that depitced the pair as the lead characters in the 1993 film \"Grumpy Old Men\".\u00a0 Hans F\u00f6rstl, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at the Technical University of Munich, believes that it would be hard for an assessment to capture the cognitive complexity and demands of being a head of state. \"Activities of daily living, cognitive performance during daily routines and challenges is decisive, not the performance during a shorter or longer test,\" F\u00f6rstl says. \"The demands on a head of state are exceptional in every respect; no test would be able to gauge that mix of fitness, intelligence, experience and wisdom.\" McDermott, for her part, thinks that though the tests are sufficiently sound, in the US the idea is a non-starter for political reasons. Given the polarised nature of beliefs around certain politicians, she wonders, \"If they passed, would the public believe it?\" Some commentators see the debate over the candidates for the US 2024 presidential election as an opportunity to shine the spotlight on \"toxic ageism\" \u2013 and draw attention to the need to support older workers in general. Whether we like it or not, many experts believe that everyone is likely to have to work for longer in the future. (Read more from the BBC about what it's like to work past your 100th birthday).\u00a0 However, others disagree. According to a poll by the\u00a0Associated Press and the research organisation Norc Center\u00a0for Public Affairs, the majority of voters see US President Joe Biden's age as a significant concern. Meanwhile, a recent survey by CBS and the data analytics firm YouGov found that the majority of respondents thought it would be \"too demanding\" for someone to hold elected office as the US president over the age of 75 \u2013 which would rule out both Biden and Trump. Whatever the public decide, it's hard to imagine that cognitive testing will finally lay the debate to rest. * This article was originally pubished on 15 September 2023.

            "title": "Cody Fisher: Friend describes attack inside Birmingham club",
            "text": "A friend of a footballer killed in a nightclub shouted \"he's been stabbed\" after a group surrounded him and he fell to the floor, a court heard. Cody Fisher was knifed in the heart and died on the dancefloor at Crane in Birmingham on 26 December 2022. Friend Harry Newman said about 10 people surrounded Mr Fisher. He then saw blood on his arm as he shook his friend on the floor. Three men deny murdering the 23-year-old. Remy Gordon, 23, of Cofton Park Drive, Birmingham, Kami Carpenter, 22, and 19-year-old Reegan Anderson, both of no fixed address, all deny murder and affray. Giving evidence at Birmingham Crown Court on Wednesday, Mr Newman said he went to the nightclub with three friends and then stayed with Mr Fisher and others from about 23:00 GMT. They were \"talking, dancing and laughing\" by the dancefloor before a large group suddenly approached and surrounded Mr Fisher. They asked him to go outside, with several of the group going towards an exit, Mr Newman said. Mr Fisher refused. One of the group said it was because Mr Fisher \"had been acting bad\" at The Farm, a pub in Solihull he had been at with Mr Newman and others on Christmas Eve. As the group regathered, Mr Newman said he did not know what the problem was, and tried to get Mr Fisher to leave the situation by directing him towards the dancefloor. He recalled saying there would be \"safety in numbers\" and \"let's go\". But a fight quickly broke out, he said, with punches thrown at Mr Fisher who was trying to defend himself. Mr Newman grabbed him but he came loose and he tried again as the fighting continued, but Mr Fisher \"seemed to fall backwards\" to the floor as he grabbed him by his stomach with his arm. He was unresponsive, and thinking he had been knocked out, Mr Newman shook him and shouted his name, but he felt a \"warm wetness\" on his hand which he realised was Mr Fisher's blood, jurors heard. Mr Newman said he had shouted \"he's been stabbed\" and \"he's bleeding... he's dying\" as he ran to a bar to raise help, \"unimpressed\" with the immediate reaction of security in the premises. He went to call an ambulance himself then left the venue to meet paramedics outside to take them to his friend. The court heard the phone operator asked if Mr Fisher was breathing to which Mr Newman said 'no, he's dead\". Ambulance crews subsequently confirmed to him Mr Fisher had died. He described members of the group, as white and dark-skinned with one wearing a ski mask \"just under his eyes\". George Robinson, another friend with Mr Fisher in Crane at the time, told jurors Mr Fisher \"looked terrified\" when someone from the group of between six to 10 people shouted at him to go outside. He described two people who then allegedly attacked Mr Fisher, with one male headbutting him, he said.  That male, he said, was black with braided hair and about 6ft 5' tall wearing a black hooded top with a Balenciaga label on the back. The second was of mixed race, wearing a grey tracksuit and about 6ft tall with short hair, aged in his 20s. Mr Robinson said he had seen him on Christmas Eve at The Farm pub. Under cross-examination, Trevor Burke KC, representing Mr Gordon, said he had not said in his statement to police after the stabbing there were six to 10 people in the group. He asked if he had discussed his evidence with his friend Mr Newman when the pair had shared a coffee together on Wednesday morning before court. But Mr Robinson said he had not spoken about it with him as it was a \"touchy subject\". He confirmed to Talbir Singh, representing Mr Anderson, he did not see a weapon or know his friend had been stabbed, agreeing the incident looked \"like a fist fight\". Adam Peepall, a third friend of Mr Fisher who was with him at Crane said he learnt of his subsequent death via a message from another friend in their Snapchat group which said: \"He's gone\", which shocked him, he said.

            "title": "Clapham attack suspect Abdul Shokoor Ezedi convicted of sex offence in 2018",
            "text": "The suspect in an alkali attack in south London was convicted of a sex offence in 2018 and was later granted asylum after three attempts. Police are looking for Abdul Shokoor Ezedi, 35, who was last seen in north London on Wednesday evening.  A mother and her three-year-old daughter hurt by the corrosive substance could have suffered \"life-changing\" injuries in the attack. Police have warned people not to approach Ezedi and to instead call 999.  The 31-year-old woman and her daughter remain in hospital, along with her older daughter, eight. Five police officers were injured as they responded, as were four members of the public who tried to help. The attack took place near Clapham Common at about 19:25 on Wednesday. The suspect attempted to escape the scene in a car but crashed into a stationary vehicle, then ran.  One witness described seeing the suspect lift a young child over his head and throw her onto the ground like a \"ragdoll\", telling the BBC the incident was like a \"horror movie\".  A community worker who knows Ezedi has appealed for him to give himself up, and to get medical help for his injuries. Azad, who helps refugees in Newcastle where Ezedi lives, described the 35-year-old as polite and respectful.  In 2018, Ezedi was convicted of one charge of sexual assault and one of exposure, before being granted asylum in 2020.  He received a nine-week jail term suspended for two years for the sexual assault and, for the exposure, 36 weeks' imprisonment to be served consecutively, also suspended for two years. The Met Police earlier issued an image of him showing facial injuries.  It was taken at a Tesco Express shop on Caledonian Road, north London, at 20:48 GMT on Wednesday - about 5.4 miles (8.7 km) away from the alkali attack on Lessar Avenue in Clapham. BBC News understands that Ezedi arrived in the UK by lorry in 2016, having travelled from Afghanistan.  His suspended prison sentence for the sexual offence, passed down at Newcastle Crown Court, included an unpaid work order. Once that was complete in 2020, Ezedi was discharged from probation supervision.  Ezedi made his first unsuccessful asylum application in 2016. He later tried a second time and said he had converted to Christianity, meaning he would have been at risk if he returned to Afghanistan.  After this second claim was refused, he appealed against the decision and a tribunal overturned it in 2020, having heard from a church witness who said he believed that Ezedi had converted to Christianity.  This case is being pointed out by some in the Home Office as an example of the frustration they have with the asylum tribunal system, that people are granted asylum despite having convictions in the UK.  Current rules mean anyone sentenced to more than two years in prison is not eligible for asylum. In 2022, this was decreased to one year.  However, those who work with asylum seekers point out you can still be at risk in your home country - and therefore a genuine refugee - even if you have a conviction in the UK.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's official spokesman declined to comment on the suspect's immigration status during a live police investigation.  But he told reporters that, more broadly, \"the PM doesn't think that foreign criminals should be able to stay in the country, putting the public at risk\". Police believe Ezedi is known to the family, but said they were not yet clear on their exact relationship. At a news conference, Supt Gabriel Cameron said he had \"no idea\" what Ezedi's motivation may have been, but that he was \"wholeheartedly confident\" he would be caught. He said Ezedi is believed to be from the Newcastle area, and the car left at the scene, a Hyundai, belonged to him. Supt Cameron said the suspect was last seen in Caledonian Road. There was a heightened police presence in that area - close to London's King's Cross station - on Thursday afternoon, including unmarked cars with blue lights, and police vans. Twelve people in total were hurt in the attack, including five police officers who attended the scene. Out of four members of the public who tried to help, three went to hospital with injuries - two women in their 30s and one in her 50s.  Police say they \"bravely came to the aid of the family\" and have now been discharged from hospital.  The London Ambulance Service said it sent three ambulance crews to the scene after receiving a call about an incident near Clapham Common just before 19:30. A man in his 50s declined medical treatment for minor injuries. Five officers who were injured as they responded to the attack have left hospital after receiving treatment. Some of the burns the mother and her daughters suffered in the attack were \"quite substantial\", Met Police chief Sir Mark Rowley told BBC Radio London. One witness earlier said the mother cried \"I can't see, I can't see\" as he tried to help.  Police have urged any members of the public who saw what happened to call 101 quoting reference CAD 7790/31Jan.  Officers have also asked local residents and drivers to check their doorbell and dash cameras for any footage that might have captured a man fleeing the area. The MP for the area in which the attack took place, Labour's Bell Ribeiro-Addy, said the incident had been \"absolutely awful\" for local people, and was a symptom of a society that \"normalises violence against women and girls\". The former chief constable of Northumbria Police, who organised the manhunt for murderer Raoul Moat in July 2010, explained the involvement of multiple police forces from across the country. Sue Sim told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I had over 23 different forces working with me up in Northumbria. When British policing works together, there is nothing better than that for catching criminality.  \"British Transport Police (BTP) will be involved, Northumbria Police... because that is where he [Ezedi] is known to live. \"There will be information sent around to all forces with officers being urged on their daily briefings to keep an eye open for this man. \"Officers will be trawling through all the CCTV in any of the stations, in the area; checking up on any relatives and friends and making sure they track this man. \"The Met will make sure he is caught and put before the courts.\" Former immigration minister Robert Jenrick said it was \"not a great surprise\" to hear that Ezedi had been granted asylum after claiming to have converted to Christianity. He said there were often cases of asylum applicants presenting as Christian converts, \"aided and abetted by often well-meaning but na\u00efve vicars and priests\".",

            "title": "Igor Girkin shot down a passenger jet, then insulted Putin. Which one put him in jail?",
            "text": "The last time I saw Igor Girkin was five years ago in the stairwell of a Moscow news agency. \"Would you consider giving me an interview?\" I asked. \"No,\" he replied sharply and scurried away. I saw him again today. No stairwell. This time, Girkin was in a caged dock surrounded by police in the Moscow City Court.  Along with other media we were allowed in to film him for just one minute before the end of his trial.  A police dog kept barking. Girkin found that amusing. The verdict less so. Minutes later he was found guilty on extremism charges and sentenced to four years in a penal colony.  This wasn't his first conviction.  In The Hague in 2022, in absentia, Girkin was found guilty of the murder of 298 people: the passengers and crew of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17.  The Boeing jet had been shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014 by Russian-controlled forces in the early stages of Russia's war there.  Girkin was one of three men sentenced to life imprisonment. A judgement he ignored. A year after we'd met in the stairwell, I managed to get through to Girkin on the phone and ask him about the Hague.  \"I do not recognise the authority of the Dutch court on this matter,\" he told me.  \"I am a military man and I am not going to accept that a civilian court in a foreign country has the authority to convict a person who took part in someone else's civil war, only because their civilians were killed. \"Do you know who shot down [the plane]?\" \"The rebels didn't shoot down the Boeing. I have nothing more to say.\" \"If it wasn't the rebels, then was it Russian soldiers?\" I asked. \"That's it. Goodbye.\" He hung up.   Now he is going to prison. But not for mass murder. And not for life.  So, who exactly is Girkin - also known under his pseudonym as Igor Strelkov - and why has a Moscow court sent him to jail? He is a former FSB officer in Russia's domestic security service. In 2014 he played a key role in the fighting in Ukraine's Donbas region: a conflict engineered and orchestrated by Moscow. He organised and commanded pro-Russia militias in eastern Ukraine.  The Dutch court would later rule that Russia had been in control of the separatist forces fighting in eastern Ukraine and that Girkin had helped to bring the Buk missile system into Ukraine that was used to shoot down flight MH17.   Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, ultranationalist Girkin became a prominent pro-war blogger.  He became increasingly critical of the way the Russian authorities were waging the war: not hard enough, in his view.  He founded a hard line nationalist movement called The Club of Angry Patriots.  His problems began when he started to take that anger out on President Vladimir Putin.  Public criticisms of the Russian president turned to insults. In a post last year, Girkin described Putin as \"a non-entity\" and \"a cowardly waste of space\".  A few days later he was arrested. Now he's been tried and convicted.  Of course, a four-year prison sentence is mild in comparison to other recent punishments delivered by Russian courts.  Last year pro-democracy activist Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to a quarter of a century behind bars after being convicted of treason, a case he and his supporters insist was politically motivated. How would the \"Angry Patriots\" react to Girkin's prison term? Would they pour on to the streets in protest?  Not exactly. A few dozen supporters gathered outside the Moscow City Court to chant \"Freedom to Strelkov!\" but there was little hint of optimism in their voices.  \"They've put a Russian national patriot on trial,\" Denis tells me. \"I hope our people wake up and fight. Unfortunately, we don't see much pushback. Everyone seems to be hiding away.\" Also in the crowd was retired colonel and outspoken ultranationalist Vladimir Kvachkov. Having informed me that \"Russia will always be the enemy of the Anglo-Saxon West\" and assured me that the break-up of the United Kingdom was inevitable, Mr Kvachkov claimed that Girkin was being punished for \"fighting against the system.\" In recent years the \"system\" concentrated on clearing the Russian political landscape of pro-democracy, pro-Western critics and challengers.  A prison sentence for Girkin suggests the Russian authorities have now decided to crack down on critics from the opposite end of the spectrum: the so-called ultra-patriots.  Last year's mutiny by Wagner mercenaries led by Yevgeny Prigozhin may be the reason.  The Putin system survived the challenge. But that drama will have alerted the Kremlin to the potential dangers from highly motivated nationalistic and patriotic elements in Russian society.",

            "title": "Boeing groundings continue as FAA inspections proceed",
            "text": "US officials said they have completed inspections of a first batch of Boeing planes, which were grounded for safety review after a cabin panel broke off one of the firm's jets mid-flight.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered 171 Boeing planes out of service after the 5 Jan incident. It said it had finished 40 inspections but offered no further update on when the jets might be cleared to fly. Airlines had said preliminary reviews revealed issues such as loose bolts.   Alaska Airlines and United, the two airlines with most of the affected planes, have had to cancel hundreds of flights since the planes were ordered out of service. The FAA said on Wednesday that officials will review the findings to determine if the maintenance and inspection conducted on the first batch of planes is adequate.  Once that process has been approved, it will be required on every grounded plane before being cleared for flight, the agency said.  The update comes as pressure grows on Boeing and the FAA to answer for the emergency on the Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to California, in which a cabin panel blew out shortly after take-off. Passengers on the plane, which returned to the airport without serious injury, have filed two lawsuits. saying the incident led to intense fear and trauma and alleging that not all of the air masks on the flight were functioning.  \"Mom ... We're in masks. I love you,\" one passenger texted at the time, according to one of the complaints, which accuses Boeing and Alaska Airlines of negligence.  The FAA said last week that it was expanding its review of Boeing's manufacturing processes and production lines, including for its troubled supplier Spirit Aerosystems.  It also said it would examine potential changes to the current controversial quality review system, in which the regulator delegates many of its responsibilities to Boeing staff, should be changed.  Senator Maria Cantwell, who represents Washington, the historic base of Boeing's operations, last week sought documents from the agency, saying it appeared the FAA's oversight processes had \"not been effective in ensuring that Boeing produces airplanes that are in condition for safe operation\". Boeing has been trying to repair its reputation since two of its 737 Max planes crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people.  Poor design of a piece of its flight control system was found to play a role, and authorities grounded its popular 737 Max planes globally for more than 18 months. Lax oversight by the FAA was also faulted. Boeing has reported a string of smaller manufacturing issues as production resumed. In a further embarrassment, the Boeing plane intended to transport US Secretary of State Antony Blinken from Davos to Washington was barred from take-off on Wednesday, after suffering what was described to reporters as \"a critical failure related to an oxygen leak\". Boeing said this week that an outside party would be brought in to assess its production practices, with Boeing commercial airplanes president and CEO Stan Deal saying the company was \"not where we need to be\".",

The fighters from Brandon Boxing Club, in County Durham, have been fundraising for a year to pay for the 10-night trip. They will compete in the Brampton Box Cup, an Olympic-style event, in a field of more than 500 boxers from around the world. Twelve-year-old Mia \"The Machine\" said she \"really wants to win\" her bouts, but will \"learn and get better\" if she happens to lose. A total of 14 of the club's boxers are heading out to Canada, including 28-year-old professional fighter Callum Wilson.   The youngest amateur is just 10 years old. Head coach Alex Oliver said: \"The amateurs will compete in the Box Cup over the course of four days and Callum will get some world-class sparring over there ahead of his professional bout in March.  \"So it's great experience for them all.\" Mr Oliver said the club had taken its younger members to mini box cups in Sweden and Ireland, but wanted to do a bigger trip. The team will use their free time to visit some of Canada's famous landmarks, such as the CN Tower and Niagara Falls. But despite travelling across the Atlantic, training will not slow down. \"We will be training in the morning and we will be checking weights, so there's no misbehaviour,\" Mr Oliver said.  \"We are not going to make up the numbers, we're going to win some medals.\" Follow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

            "text": "A new artificial intelligence (AI) tool has been developed to help boost cancer diagnosis and treatment. Scientists at Histofy, a spin-out company from The University of Warwick, have designed the device to help medical professionals to grade cancer by analysing how cells divide. Counting the number of cells undergoing division serves as a key indicator of cancer aggressiveness, or grade. This information is then used to decide on treatment options. Traditional cell division counting methods have been described by Histofy scientists as \"time-consuming and plagued by poor reliability\". To address this, the team developed MitPro, which uses AI to count and profile how cancer cells split throughout the entire tumour sample. This identifies the most suitable areas for further analysis. The tool has been designed to enhance the current standard of care for grading various cancers, such as breast cancer and sarcomas. Simon Graham, chief technology officer for Histofy at the University of Warwick's computer science department, said: \"AI holds tremendous potential in facilitating better cancer care.  \"MitPro helps to improve current grading systems across a range of cancers by more accurately assessing the rate in which cancer cells are dividing.\" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

            "text": "Boeing has asked Ryanair to send extra engineers to oversee quality checks of its planes \"on the ground\" following the Alaska Airlines incident. Ryanair's boss told the BBC that quality was improving but the incident had shown there was \"more to be done\". It comes after an unused door fell off a Boeing 737 Max 9 operated by US-based Alaska Airlines. Ryanair does not use Boeing's 737 Max 9 aircraft but operates the Max 8 variant and has Max 10s on order.   The airline is one of Boeing's biggest customers for the 737 Max family, with more than 100 in service and due to have some 400 more by 2034. Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said that he expects delivery delays to affect its capacity. Asked in an interview with the BBC if he had complete confidence in Boeing's quality control processes after the incident which saw an unused door fall off, the Ryanair boss said \"no\". But he added that his airline did now have \"more confidence\" in plane maker Boeing. Mr O'Leary also said that a delivery of 12 planes towards the end of last year had been \"in terms of defects the best deliveries we've had in three years\". He acknowledged what happened with the Alaska Airlines flight had been serious but said the industry always learned from incidents. Ryanair will deploy more engineers to oversee quality control at US factories in Seattle and Wichita building aircraft and fuselages for the airline. Mr O'Leary said that Boeing made good planes, but compared the relationship to a marriage: \"I can be in love with you and still occasionally criticise some of your personal habits. I think that's the same with Boeing.\" He suggested that the management team at Boeing \"needs to be improved\" following the incident, although he gave his support for Boeing's current chief executive David Calhoun, stating that he is \"doing a stellar job in very tough circumstances\". Mr O'Leary added: \"We don't need more senior management changes in Boeing.\"  On Monday, Boeing announced that an outside party would also be brought in to assess its production practices. It will also check the work of the firm that supplies and installs the parts involved in the accident. Last week, the US regulator extended the grounding of 737 Max's with similar fuselage panels, while United and Alaska Airlines have said they were extending the cancellations of any flights involving the 737 Max 9 through until Wednesday. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also said it would conduct an audit of the plane's production line, adding it believed there were \"significant problems\" with the 737 Max 9 jet as well as \"other manufacturing problems\". Announcing the latest measures, Stan Deal, who heads up Boeing's commercial division, said the company was \"not where we need to be\". Scrutiny of Boeing has been renewed after the blowout on the Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to California, which forced an emergency landing but resulted in no serious injuries. The US aerospace giant has been struggling to restore confidence after crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving a different plane in the 737 Max group killed 346 people. Poor design of a piece of its flight control system was found to play a role in those crashes, and authorities grounded its popular 737 Max planes globally for more than 18 months. Poor oversight by the FAA was also cited. On Tuesday, Boeing also announced that it had appointed Kirkland H. Donald, a former Navy admiral, as the independent advisor responsible for overseeing a review of its quality control systems for its commercial aircraft. He and a range of experts will provide Boeing bosses, including Mr Calhoun, with a series of recommendations.",

            "text": "A domestic All Nippon Airways (ANA) flight in Japan has returned to its departure airport after a crack was reported on the cockpit window during the flight. The crack appeared in the outermost of the four layers of window surrounding the cockpit. There were no injuries to anyone on board.  ANA flight NH1182 was flying from the city of Sapporo in Hokkaido to Toyama, on Japan's main island, Honshu. The plane, a Boeing 737, landed back at Sapporo's New Chitose airport at around 12:10 local time (3:10 GMT). A spokesperson for ANA, Japan's largest carrier, said that the crack had been found as the flight passed over Hakodate.  \"The crack was not something that affected the flight's control or pressurisation,\" the spokesperson said. The plane headed back to the airport where a safe landing was carried out.  Aviation expert John Strickland said the cause of the crack was still unknown. \"These things do sometimes happen, something may have struck the window, for example a bird, a large hailstone, it's not unheard of\". \"You might occasionally get a stress fracture too, from wear and tear,\" he added, \"but that's very rare\". He said the airline would likely have to replace the whole window, not just the broken layer, to make sure the aircraft was completely safe. \"These things do happen, it's impossible to quantify how frequently\".  There were 59 passengers and six crew members on board. Alternative flights were arranged for the passengers. This is the second incident involving a Boeing 737 model aircraft in as many weeks. However the ANA flight was not one of Boeing's 737 Max 9 airplanes, but an earlier version which was \"by no means old\", Mr Strickland said. All Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft have been grounded by the US aviation regulator the FAA after an Alaska Airlines plane suffered a blowout that saw a cabin panel fall off a new plane in mid air, leaving a gaping hole in the side of its fuselage last week. That plane, carrying 177 passengers and crew, had to make an emergency landing in the US state of Oregon. On Friday the FAA extended the grounding of Boeing 737 Max 9 planes indefinitely for further safety checks and said it would tighten oversight of Boeing itself. The FAA said the 171 planes with the same configuration as the one in the incident had to stay grounded \"for the safety of American travellers\".",

            "text": "US authorities are stepping up oversight of Boeing's manufacturing line a week after a door plug broke off one of its planes mid-flight. The head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said he believed there were \"significant problems\" with the 737 Max 9 jet as well as \"other manufacturing problems\". The FAA said it would conduct an audit of the plane's production line. It also plans to review who is in charge of quality oversight.  For years, the FAA has delegated some parts of quality reviewing of planes to Boeing, but the practice has been controversial, drawing repeated warnings of safety risks.  \"It is time to re-examine the delegation of authority and assess any associated safety risks,\" FAA administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement.  \"The grounding of the 737-9 and the multiple production-related issues identified in recent years require us to look at every option to reduce risk. The FAA is exploring the use of an independent third party to oversee Boeing's inspections and its quality system.\" Boeing did not immediately comment. The US aerospace giant has been struggling to restore confidence after crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving a different plane in the 737 Max group killed 346 people.  Poor design of a piece of its flight control system was found to play a role, and authorities grounded its popular 737 Max planes globally for more than 18 months. Lax oversight by the FAA was also faulted.  Boeing has reported a string of smaller manufacturing issues as production resumed. The blowout on the Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to California, which forced an emergency landing but resulted in no serious injuries, has revived scrutiny. Passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight have filed a class action lawsuit against Boeing. Their lawyers described the incident as a \"nightmare experience\" that had caused \"economic, physical and ongoing emotional consequences that have understandably deeply affected our clients\".  Mark Pegram, the father of Sam Pegram, an aid worker who died in the Ethiopian Airlines 2019 crash, said the emergency should make the government reconsider the deal it made with Boeing after the the earlier fatal accidents, in which the firm paid $2.5bn but may see its criminal charge dropped. He also called for an independent industry monitor. \"The need for this independent oversight is even more necessary now when one considers the ineptness of the FAA which has failed again to properly oversee Boeing's Max aircraft production, as evidenced by these latest near catastrophes,\" he said. \"The lives of passengers should not needlessly, and once again, be put at risk.\" The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating what happened on the Alaska Airlines plane, which had been in service for just eight weeks. On Thursday, the FAA formally announced an inquiry into Boeing's processes.  It has also grounded 171 planes - most of the 737 Max 9 fleet - with similar door plugs for inspections, which have revealed loose bolts and other issues.  Boeing has said it will cooperate fully and transparently with the probes. Supplier Spirit Aerosystems is also involved.   Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun has already said the company will admit its \"mistake\" and has described the issue as a \"quality escape\". The FAA's Mr Whitaker told CNBC that officials believed there were \"other manufacturing problems\".",

            "text": "Airline regulators in the US have formally launched an investigation of Boeing's processes, after a door plug blew off one of its planes. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would examine whether Boeing failed to ensure its completed jets matched their approved design.  The FAA had already grounded most of the 737 Max 9 fleet for inspection. The reviews after the emergency on the Alaska Airlines flight have uncovered issues such as loose bolts. \"This incident should have never happened and it cannot happen again,\" the FAA said. \"Boeing's manufacturing practices need to comply with the high safety standards they're legally accountable to meet.\"  Boeing said it would \"cooperate full and transparently\" with the investigation.  Company boss, Dave Calhoun, had previously described the problem as a \"quality escape\". It means the incident was caused by some failure in quality control in the plane, which had been in service for just eight weeks before the blowout. He told CNBC there were still questions that needed to be answered about how the incident was allowed to happen.  \"What broke down in our gauntlet of inspections? What broke down in the original work that allowed for that escape to happen,\" he said. The door plug is a piece of fuselage, with a window, that fills the space where an emergency exit would be in certain configurations. The part broke off a Boeing 737 Max 9 jet that was operated by Alaska Airlines minutes after its take-off from Portland, Oregon on Friday.  No serious injuries were reported after an emergency return to the airport but the FAA on Saturday grounded 171 planes that had the same door plug installed.  It is unclear when the planes will be allowed to fly again.  Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has said the government would not be rushed into clearing the grounded planes, despite hundreds of flight cancellations.  He said the aircraft \"need to be 100% safe\".  \"The only consideration on the timeline is safety,\" he said. \"Until it is ready, it is not ready. Nobody can or should be rushed in that process.\" Alaska Airlines has cancelled about 20% of its flights after 65 of its Max 9s were grounded. United Airlines, the other major US 737 MAX 9 operator, has 79 of the planes in its fleet out of action. It said it expects \"significant\" cancellations on Thursday after 167 flights did not go ahead on Wednesday. Alaska Airlines said it still needed revised inspection and maintenance instructions from Boeing, which must be approved by the FAA before it can begin flying the planes again. \"We will only return these aircraft to service when all findings have been fully resolved and meet all FAA and Alaska's stringent standards,\" the airline said. Both Alaska and United said on Monday they had found loose parts on a number of the grounded aircraft. The part which fell off was eventually found in a teacher's back garden without its four bolts. Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating what happened on the flight, said on Monday it was possible the bolts were missing from the start but they might have come off in the descent. The incident has revived scrutiny of Boeing, which has been trying to repair its reputation after crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving a different version of the 737 Max plane killed 346 people.  Its popular 737 Max planes were subsequently grounded globally for more than 18 months. It has reported a string of smaller issues as production resumed. ",

            "title": "The F-16 at 50: Why it's still in demand",
            "text": "The F-16 jet fighter took its first ever flight in 1974, but it is still as important an aircraft now as it was then. Were it not for one test pilot's quick thinking 50 years ago, the entire F-16 programme might never have made it past its first fateful flight. When pilot Phil Oestricher climbed into the cockpit of the General Dynamics YF-16 prototype at Edwards Air Force Base in California on 20 January 1974, his mission was a relatively straightforward one \u2013 a high-speed taxi test where the aircraft would travel on the ground under the power of its own engine. The YF-16 had only been unveiled to the public just over a month earlier. The first flight was not scheduled to take place until early February. But the futuristic-looking jet had other ideas. As Oestricher raised the aircraft's nose slightly, the YF-16 started rolling \u2013 so sharply that the aircraft's left wing and right tailplane hit the tarmac. \"As Oestricher desperately fought to maintain control of his wild steed, the situation became increasingly dire as the YF-16 began to veer to the left,\" wrote the Seattle Post Intelligencer, reporting on the almost disastrous first flight. Oestricher realised he would have to depart from the planned test and get the aircraft airborne \u2013 and very quickly \u2013 before it crashed. After some heart-stopping moments \u2013 at one point the aircraft dropped back down onto the runway \u2013 Oestricher managed to pick up enough speed for the prototype to take into the air and complete a dramatically unexpected six-minute-long flight before landing back at the base. By virtue of his skillful flying, Oestricher had prevented disaster \u2013 and helped bring to life an aircraft that has become one of the most successful in living memory. Fifty years later, more than 4,600 F-16s have rolled off the factory lines, and production shows no sign of stopping. \u00a0 If Oerlicher hadn't managed to save the YF-16 from crashing on its first taxi test, there would be a sizeable F-16-shaped gap in many of the world's air forces. The aircraft's design has also had a lasting impact on civil aviation today too, providing the first use of technologies that are now commonplace in passenger airlines, for example. At any moment of the day \u2013\u00a0or night \u2013 there's a good chance an F-16 is in the air, somewhere in the world. Since coming into service with US Air Force (USAF) in 1978, the F-16 has been flown by 25 other air forces, from Norway to Chile, Morocco to Singapore. In 2023, 45 years after it entered service, more than 800 remained flying with the USAF. Designed as a small, light and ultra-nimble dogfighter, the F-16 has taken on more and more roles, from ground attack to anti-shipping to photo reconnaissance to hunting surface-to-air missile launchers. Since 2015, it's been the most numerous military fixed-wing aircraft in the world; more than 2,000 are thought to still be in active use globally today. Ukraine's plea to the West for modern weapons to resist Russia's 2022 invasion has included calls for F-16s for its air force. Ukrainian pilots are currently training on F-16s in Denmark, and deliveries are due to start in the summer. In early January, Slovakia became the latest country to take delivery of its first F-16s, 50 years almost to the day since the aircraft first took to the air. Keeping a frontline combat aircraft in service \u2013 let alone production \u2013 for five decades is no mean feat. The reasons why air forces still want F-16s is due to some truly innovative aspects of its design, and some hard lessons learned from air combat in the Vietnam War. During the 1960s, the US had embraced the new technology of air-to-air missile as the best weapon to shoot down enemy aircraft. When the Vietnam War began in 1965, some of its frontline fighter aircraft, such as the F-4 Phantom II, did not have guns; US military planners believed the plane's missiles would be enough. The missile-armed American fighters, however, came up against small and agile Soviet-made MiG fighters as the war in Vietnam developed. Some of North Vietnam's MiGs were virtually identical to Soviet fighters that had fought over the Korean peninsula in the early 1950s, and were now considered almost laughingly obsolete in the West. In close-quarters combat, however, where American fighters couldn't bring their missiles to bear, they could be formidable opponents. Between 1965 and 1968, America's fighters still shot down more North Vietnamese fighters than they were losing, but the gap dramatically narrowed. The big, twin-engined American fighters were easier to spot from a distance; the small, single-engined MiGs were not. One solution was to set up training schools like the US Navy's \"Top Gun\", which taught US aviators the lost art of dogfighting; this came into operation before the end of the Vietnam War, and vastly improved the American kill-to-loss ratio. Dogfighting had started in World War One, in small aircraft barely faster than a family car. Similar combat in jets capable of flying at several hundred miles an hour is a completely different experience \u2013 the high speed means you are subjected to the higher gravitational forces, or G-force, in a tight turn for longer. But another was a more ambitious programme designed to counter increasingly improved Soviet aircraft. US defence chiefs had already been alarmed, at the end of the 1960s, by the emergence of the Soviet MiG-25, a giant fighter aircraft which could fly at three times the speed of sound. (See BBC Future's article: The pilot who stole a secret Soviet jet.) The Pentagon's call for a powerful interceptor to counter the MiG-25 led to the McDonnell-Douglas F-15 Eagle, a large and fast interceptor designed to shoot down enemy aircraft at high altitude with radar-guided missiles. But the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies like Poland and East Germany fielded thousands more combat aircraft that would fly and fight at lower level. What was also needed was a small, agile aircraft that could shoot down enemy planes with heatseeking missiles and a gun \u2013 a direct learning from the hard lessons of the Vietnam war. The USAF would need many hundreds of such fighters, and there was the strong possibility that Nato countries and other US allies around the globe would then follow suit. Five designs ended up in contention for this lucrative project, with two quickly emerging as the frontrunners \u2013 the YF-16 from General Dynamics (now part of Lockheed-Martin) and the YF-17 from rival Northrop. The YF-16 was built to dogfight first and foremost, and that directly influenced aspects of its design, including its cockpit canopy. The pilot would sit in a raised cockpit with a huge canopy that offered almost unrivalled view \u2013 similar to early jet fighters that had been replaced by missile-armed fighters. \"At least part of the 'fighter mafia' that were pushing it were looking back to Korea and the F-86 Sabre,\" says Tim Robinson, a military aviation specialist at the Royal Aeronautical Society in the UK. \"They were looking at something that was really manoeuvrable and had really great vision for the pilot with a bubble canopy.\" One idea that was proposed, Robinson continues, was to do away with a radar completely. \"The idea would be to have two infrared-seeking missiles and a gun. And they would have to churn these things out. They were looking at the numbers of Soviet aircraft and were thinking: 'Gosh, we're going to need lots of these, we have to build lots and lots of them'.\" The new jet wouldn't need the long range of the F-15, so could be a lot smaller and lighter and would only need one engine to the F-15's two. That combination of low weight and a powerful engine creates a high \"thrust-to-weight ratio\", which not only enabled high speed but the ability to turn sharply \u2013 perfect for dogfighting. The F-16 was designed to withstand up to 9G in a dogfight (which means anything that would weigh 1kg on the ground suddenly weighs 9kg). Flying at high-G generates enormous stress on both the airframe and the pilot. The F-4 by comparison, could pull 7G, but not for long as its heavier airframe bled speed and height much more quickly. In order to help the pilot keep conscious in high-G turns, the cockpit seat in the F16 is reclined, which helps dampen some of the effects on the pilot. Jeff Bolton is an aviation journalist and broadcaster who has twice flown in a two-seat version of the F-16, used for both pilot training and specialised missions. \"More than any other fighter I've flown in, by far, it is a glove, it is literally like putting on a leather driving glove when you get in it,\" he says. \"I'm almost 6ft 4in (1.9m), so it's a tight, tight fit for me, but I could still lower my seat all the way, and I could get my hand in between my helmet and the canopy. And there's, I guess, a recognition from your body that you're 'wearing' the aeroplane.\" The F-16's cockpit design went far further than just a reclined seat and a good view. The plane's designers did away with one of the most central features of fighter planes since World War One \u2013 a control stick between the pilot's legs. Instead, the F-16 had a joystick-style controller on the right side of the cockpit, much like one you'd use on a computer game flight simulator. This controller \u2013 at least in the first examples of the F-16 \u2013 didn't move as the pilot applied force to it. This was because the F-16 was partly being flown by a flight computer making constant small adjustments to the aircraft's control surfaces \u2013 a system we now know as \"fly-by-wire\". It was the first aircraft in the world to use it. It is now found in most modern airliners, such as the Boeing 777 and Airbus A320. \"We now take fly-by-wire for granted,\" says Robinson. \"Now you see fly-by-wire everywhere. A small consumer drone that's got fly-by-wire, people fly on fly-by-wire airliners. 'Electric Jet' was one of the one of the nicknames [of the F-16] and yeah, I think there was probably some resistance in some quarters taking the pilot out of the equation.\" The F-16 was originally built to compliment the F-15 at lower altitudes, but it was soon found that \u2013 much like the World War Two Supermarine Spitfire \u2013 the F-16's airframe allowed it to carry heavier loads, more fuel and a bigger radar. \"The F-16 is almost an utterly perfect Swiss Army knife,\" says Bolton. The F-16 has, in the 21st Century, become equally important as a ground attack aircraft \u2013 not something its designers had on their drawing boards in the early 1970s. That adaptability allowed it to carry out more and more roles, which made it increasingly attractive to air forces. \"Where there's a conflict, there's probably an F-16 involved somewhere,\" says Robinson. The original nickname for the F-16 was the \"Fighting Falcon\", but the name never stuck, says Robinson. \"Nobody ever uses it. They call it the Viper, the reason being it came out in the late 70s the same time as [TV series] Battlestar Galactica. It looks like a Colonial Viper,\" Robinson says, referring to the spaceships featured in the show. \"It still looks like it belongs in the future.\" *** Parked on the ground, the F-16 looked futuristic. But in the air, it could be a revelation, even for pilots with plenty of fast-jet experience. \"There were instances where pilots were 'G-locking' [blacking out in high-G situations],\" says Robinson. \"It was an aircraft that could push pilots beyond their physiological limits not only because it was 9G but also how fast that would come on.\" Bolton has experienced just that in one of his flights in an F-16. Only a small amount of force is needed on the F-16's controller for it to respond. \"Its tiny little control inputs, little, little inputs, but the next thing you know, you've got 9G on your chest. So if you're 220lb (100kg) like I am, times that by nine. The whole world at that point is laying on top of you.\" The F-16 is often described by pilots as very easy to fly, partly thanks to the fly-by-wire system, and partly because of its strong airframe, with big lift-generating wings. You might also like: \"When I flew it the first time, [the pilot] said to me, 'Hey, all right, your jet',\" says Bolton, meaning the pilot had given him control of the aircraft. The pilot gave Bolton some advice. \"It's very sensitive. So just keep that in mind.'\" Bolton says he started with an aileron roll, where the aircraft rolls 360 degrees without losing altitude, careful not to exert too much force on the F-16's control stick. \"So I executed that. And he looks up at me and he goes, 'Dude, that was great.'\" The instructor said that student pilots would at first put too much force onto the F-16's controller. The plane is so responsive \"it slams the instructors head off the sides of the canopy\", says Bolton. Bolton has flown in earlier US military jets, such as the Northrop F-5, which for a long time was used to play the role of Soviet jets in Top Gun exercises. \"Talk about old school, you know that thing is great, a little like an MG sports car with a Corvette motor in it.\" But the F-5, which used to fill similar roles to the F-16 in many air forces, is a more \"analogue airplane\". Its small cockpit doesn't offer anything like the F-16's visibility. \"You're out over the [front landing] gear so you can see over the nose as the ground falls away from you as you take off,\" says Bolton of the F-16's cockpit. \" John Waters is someone who knows that view very well. Now a Boeing 777 pilot and podcaster who runs the Afterburn aviation podcast, he started flying F-16s for the USAF in 2013. He flew ground attack missions in Syria against Isis and trained for particularly dangerous missions called SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defence), hunting for ground-based missile sites, which pilots nicknamed \"Wild Weasel\". These F-16s would be able to launch a radar-guided missile at an enemy fighter far beyond visual range, drop a guided bomb at a target on the ground and fire a radiation-seeking missile to home in on an enemy radar site \u2013 all at the same time. Waters did all three in training. \"If you had all three of those in the air at one time, you were doing the 'Wild Weasel' deal to its fullest,\" he says. Towards the end of his F-16 flying career, however, Waters was flying demonstration flights and aerobatic routines at air shows. (You can see one of his air show displays in 2018 here, captured on a camera in the cockpit.) He can still remember the first time he strapped into the F-16's cockpit. \"It was July in Phoenix, and it was 119F (48C),\" he tells the BBC. \"There's a lot of sensory overload\u2026 the heat, the jet noise\u2026 you're jumping into a plane that you've only been in the simulator for a few times, in a controlled comfortable environment.\" Waters says that about 5,000ft (1.5km) up he dropped his mask and that he was drenched with sweat, both from the heat and the excitement flying the F-16 for the first time. \"I just took a minute to enjoy the moment. It\u2019s a pretty incredible sensation, pushing that power up. And at that time, the absolute most powerful thing I'd flown.\" Waters' YouTube channel is full of Go-Pro footage of him taking his F-16 off a runway into finely planned airshow routines. He would don wearable tech which monitored his heart rate. \"In a 15-minute profile, I would burn anywhere from 300 to 600 calories all the way up until the end, but if it was hot outside? The F-16 has a decent environmental cooling system (ECS), but it is really there to cool the radar and the avionics and it doesn't work great until you get up at altitude.\" The only tricky part of flying the F-16, Waters says, is landing it. \"Landing it well, it's not always an easy thing, because it wants to keep flying. You see F-16's do what we call a 'bubble' or a 'bounce'. You can't stall it traditionally, the fly-by-wire does not want you to do that, it wants to keep it flying.\" Waters stopped flying the F-16 in 2019. \"I still miss it. Nothing beats strapping on the F-16. It's like you're on the end of a telephone pole with a rocket motor strapped to your back.\"  The F-16 is in the process of being replaced in the US and some Nato air forces by another Lockheed-made fighter, the F-35. Each F-35 costs more than $100m (\u00a381m) and is designed to destroy enemy planes with long-range missiles, long before the F-35 is ever picked up on their radars. An F-16 without add-ons might only cost a third of that price. It will be 2056 before the F-35 will mark 50 years since it first flew. There's a good chance that even then, somewhere in the world F-16s will still be flying. --  If you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

            "text": "A US-bound ANA flight was forced to return to Tokyo after an intoxicated passenger bit a crew member mid-flight. The man, reportedly a 55-year-old American, was \"heavily drunk\" when he bit a cabinet attendant's arm, slightly injuring her, a spokesman for the airline told AFP. Japanese media said the man told police he had taken a sleeping pill and did not remember what happened.  It is the latest in a series of recent incidents to affect Japanese aviation. The plane, which reportedly had 159 passengers on board, was over the Pacific Ocean when the incident happened, prompting its pilots to turn back to Tokyo's Haneda Airport.  There the man was handed over to police, the airline said.  It is the second incident to impact ANA in recent days - and the fifth involving the Japanese aviation industry in a matter of weeks.  On Saturday, a domestic ANA flight in Japan had to turn back after a crack was discovered in the window of the cockpit.  The crack appeared in the outermost of the four layers of window surrounding the cockpit, and there were no injuries to anyone on board.  \"The crack was not something that affected the flight's control or pressurisation,\" an ANA spokesperson said.  The most serious of the recent incidents occurred at Haneda on 2 January, when a Japanese Airlines aircraft collided with a smaller coastguard plane.  All 379 people on board the passenger jet escaped before it burst into flames, but five of the six people on the smaller aircraft - which was supplying relief after a major earthquake hit central Japan - died.  On Tuesday, aircraft belonging to Korean Air and Cathay Pacific clipped wings at an airport on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido amid wintry conditions. There were no injuries.  A similar incident occurred on Sunday when an ANA aircraft came into \"contact\" with a Delta Air Lines plane at Chicago airport in the United States, the Japanese airline told AFP, also causing no injuries.",

            "text": "This week, one of the world\u2019s superpowers touched down in Dublin. The red (or green) carpet was rolled out, but for all its pomp and ceremony \u2013 how did the visit of China's second most powerful politician go? From the minute Li Qiang touched down, the visit was already historic. He flew in on a Boeing 747-8, arriving at about 19:00 local time on Tuesday and marking a first for Dublin Airport -  it was the largest passenger aircraft to ever land at the airport. He was welcomed by Environment Minister Eamon Ryan. The two would have much to talk about - the minister cycled across China alone in 1987 and visited the country as a minister over St Patrick\u2019s week last year. During that visit, Mr Ryan said that although Ireland had concerns around human rights and trade in the region, neither would matter too much if the climate emergency was not tackled. But it was human rights concerns that caused the most consternation for the Irish government during Mr Li's visit.  Human rights groups as well as both government and opposition representatives called on the heads of state to tackle the Chinese premier on the treatment of Muslim minorities in his nation. President Michael D Higgins released a statement ahead of his meeting with Mr Li, confirming human rights matters would be discussed - although which matters were not specified. President Higgins referenced points likely to come up at this month\u2019s Universal Periodic Review on China by the United Nations Human Rights Council: China\u2019s treatment of the Muslim Uyghur people; a crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong; and the arrest of a newspaper editor could all have been discussed.  Mr Li, for his part, put any past scuffles behind him when he arrived at President Higgins' residence:  \u201cOur relations have set a good example of mutually beneficial co-operation between countries that are different in political systems, cultural divisions, and geographic size.\u201d The president is a man known of his commitment to human rights campaigning and, with his position as a figurehead rather than a political operator, is likely to have had an easier job than Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar.  Before Mr Li's visit even took place, the Irish Falun Dafa Association (IFDA) publicly urged Mr Varadkar to raise the abuses against their members in China. The spiritual movement, also known as Falun Gong, was banned as an \u201cevil cult\u201d and a threat to the Communist Party in 1999. Amnesty International has stated it is just one of a number of groups that has been harassed and imprisoned for practising religion in China. \u201cReligious leaders and practitioners, including those belonging to house churches, Uyghur imams, Tibetan Buddist monks and Falun Gong members, were among those subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention,\u201d Amnesty has said. Mr Varadkar had other things on his mind too, with trade likely being the most prominent.  China is Ireland\u2019s largest trading partner in Asia, to the tune of about \u20ac40bn (\u00a334bn) in goods and services. When the two met in Farmleigh House in Phoenix Park, they took in a \u201cworking lunch\u201d according to officials. They ate Irish beef - a product China had banned but, it was announced during Mr Li's visit, would now be making available for import again. In his statement after the meeting, Mr Varadkar said he had put to the Chinese leader his country\u2019s concerns about human rights abuses. \u201cWe raised, in particular, our concerns about human rights in what are called the special autonomous regions: Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau. \u201cWe need to be frank about these things \u2013 that China is on the UN Human Rights Council and has international responsibilities. \u201cAny country, including our own country, should be judged by the way it treats minorities,\u201d he said, adding there were also concerns over the forthcoming trial of Jimmy Lai. Mr Lai is currently on trial in Hong Kong on charges of endangering China\u2019s national security and publishing seditious material in a newspaper in 2020. Mr Varadkar was keen to highlight the two nations did not ultimately agree on such issues: \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that the Chinese government have a different perspective on these things than we do but they were certainly willing to have them raised.\u201d In a final briefing, the proof was in the pudding. The immediate results of the visit were laid out. Irish beef exports to China are to resume, a huge issue for Irish farmers after a precautionary suspension was implemented in November 2023.  China had banned Irish beef after a single case of BSE, otherwise known as mad cow disease, had been identified.  The carcass had not entered the food chain and posed no risk to human health, but the move was a body blow for Irish agriculture.  It was also agreed that Irish citizens could visit and stay in China for up to 15 days without a visa, a sign of deepening ties and a sense of trust between the two nations. Small wins, with concerns registered about the vulnerable - as the huge jet took off with Mr Li inside, Mr Varadkar might have patted himself on the back for a diplomatic job well done. But it wasn\u2019t over yet. As he touched down in Davos for the World Economic Forum, the taoiseach was faced with another issue. Chinese media claimed that Mr Varadkar told the Chinese premier that Taiwan should be reunified with China. CGTN quoted Mr Varadkar as saying Ireland \"will always abide by the one-China principle, and hopes that China will achieve peaceful reunification at an early date\". CGTN is under the control of the Central Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party and has repeatedly been accused of publishing disinformation on behalf of the Chinese government. Mr Varadkar told Irish broadcaster RT\u00c8 while on his way to dinner that nothing of the sort had happened. He said he had reaffirmed Irish policy as being the One China policy - which is distinct from the One China principle affirmed by the Chinese government.  The policy, which evolved from the United States, allows nations to maintain unofficial links with Taiwan.  Mr Varadkar added that the \"while we don't have diplomatic or political links with Taiwan, we continue to have economic and cultural links\". As the taoiseach said himself, the two nations have \u201cdifferent perspectives\u201d.",

            "title": "Antarctic tourism: Should we just say no?",
            "text": "More people are visiting the frozen continent than ever before. Has the very idea of Antarctic tourism become unethical? It was an arresting image: a Boeing 787 Dreamliner parked on the Antarctic ice, smiling flight attendants in knee-length dresses posing in front of it. The shot, taken to mark the first landing of one of the world's largest planes on a runway of ice and snow late last year, seemed to mark a new phase for Antarctic tourism. Fortunately the flight in question was delivering personnel and supplies for research rather than tourism (unlike a 2021 Airbus A340 flight that landed in Antarctica carrying supplies for an exclusive adventure camp) \u2013 but travel to Earth's southernmost continent has nonetheless reached a new milestone. The number of visitors will hit 100,000 for the first time this tourist season (October 2023-March 2024), a 40% jump over the previous record, and has brought a new urgency to the question of how much, if any, tourism should be allowed on the icy continent. \"That number has really lit a fire under folks,\" said Claire Christian, executive director of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, a coalition of non-governmental organisations\u00a0that has been advocating for Antarctic conservation for more than 40 years. \"We are now seeing an urgency [about] the need to properly manage this industry and its effect on a very fragile and rapidly changing environment.\" The International Association of Antarctic Tourism Operators (IAATO) now lists 95 vessels in its directory, including 21 yachts, which carry wealthy tourists drawn by the lure of a \"last frontier\" destination, a place \u2013 as one operator put it \u2013 \"so pristine and remote you can hear snowflakes hitting the water\". Some ships carry upwards of 400 tourists a time, with most departing from the tip of South America for the Antarctic Peninsula, which juts northwards out of the West Antarctic ice mass. With increased competition comes a swathe of new tourist activities beyond the usual shore excursions to visit penguin and seal colonies and sightseeing trips on Zodiac inflatables for up-close views of icebergs, humpbacks and orcas. \"The industry is expanding and there is a big diversification of activities including kayaking, submersibles and helicopters,\" said Elizabeth Leane, professor of Antarctic Studies at the University of Tasmania. \"At some point it's going to get too big \u2013 but we don't know what that number is.\" \u00a0 Many IAATO members say promoting Antarctic conservation is part of their mission. The opportunity to educate and inspire \"is pivotal to safeguarding the wild and awe-inspiring places we visit\", said Hayley Peacock-Gower, chief marketing officer of Aurora Expeditions. \"We believe that small ship expeditions are the way forward, with a smaller number of passengers, led by experts and operating with the utmost respect for the environment.\" In addition to introducing new ships that generate fewer CO2 emissions, many cruise companies analyse every aspect of their operations, even low-impact activities such as snow shoeing. \"We ensure that our expedition team covers any tracks so penguins don't get stuck,\" saidDamian Perry, managing director at Hurtigruten Asia-Pacific. In fact, IAATO members follow strict rules designed to protect the environment, including removing all waste from the continent and adhering to sterilisation protocols to avoid inadvertently introducing non-native species. Nonetheless a number of biosecurity studies \u2013 including one that vacuumed tourists' pockets, socks, shoes and camera gear - found a large number of non-native species present. \"We were not surprised by the findings \u2013 it was what we anticipated,\" said Antarctic ecologist Dana Bergstrom, now a visiting professor at the University of Wollongong, who helped conduct the study. And the risks are real. An invasive lawn species has established a foothold on one of Antarctica's South Shetland Islands, while avian flu recently reached the Sub-Antarctic Islands, where it has had a devastating effect on the seal population. \"It will probably reach Antarctica sometime this season, which would be awful,\" said Leane, noting that the virus is more likely to reach Antarctica via birds rather than tourists. \"We don't know how susceptible penguins are, but seals and sea birds are definitely susceptible.\" Despite these looming threats, Bergstrom says biosecurity is not the biggest hazard facing Antarctica's wilderness areas. \"Tourists can mitigate [biosecurity risks] by taking new clothing to Antarctica,\" she said, \"but we know the carbon impact is a real issue.\"  The sheer distance most visitors travel to reach Antarctic makes carbon emissions a serious problem. The average per-person carbon emissions for an Antarctic tourist are 3.76 tonnes \u2013 about the total sum that an individual typically generates in an entire year. Studies have shown that on the Antarctic Peninsula, home to popular landing sites such as Cuverville Island on Neko Harbour, the snow has a\u00a0higher concentration\u00a0of black carbon from ship exhaust, which soaks up more heat and speeds up snow melt. One study calculated that each tourist between 2016 and 2020 was effectively melting around 83 tonnes of snow, due largely to emissions from cruise ships. The Antarctic is vulnerable not just because of the fragility of its environment, but due to the lack of a single governing body. The Antarctic Treaty, established in 1961 to provide governance for the continent, operates on a consultative basis, which means all 56 parties have to agree before a change can be implemented. \"The last major decision on tourism was a measure passed in 2009 that prohibits cruise ships carrying more than 500 passengers from making landings,\" explained Christian. That regulation has still not officially been implemented as not every signatory country has ratified it domestically. It has nonetheless been adopted by IAATO, which also restricts how many ships can visit any given site per day as well as the number of passengers who can be ashore at any one time. \"IAATO tend to lead in this area, because they are much more reactive,\" added Bergstrom. \"What you can't expect them to do, as an industry body, is to cap numbers.\" There is clear consensus that something needs to change, but no agreement on what those changes should be. Should landings be made at a larger number of sites for instance, or should we aim to keep the human footprint as small as possible? \"We are already seeing adventure-style tourism spreading down to the Ross Sea,\" Leane said. \"Perhaps we say the peninsula is the part of Antarctica that has the great human impact, and we leave the rest alone.\" Christian believes that any caps \u2013 whether on number of sites or on the numbers of ships visiting \u2013 would be contentious and suggests an alternative might be to treat Antarctica as a national park and start charging entrance fees. \"Frankly there is so little regulation now that almost anything that will protect fragile areas and ensure industry is regulated by an official legal source rather than self-regulated, would be really positive,\" she said. Researchers recommend that anyone thinking about visiting Antarctica should take a hard look at their motivation and the impacts of their choice. \"As a researcher, it's a moral decision that I make every time I go, whether what I'm doing is worth the impact,\" said Leane, who says tourists should also weigh up the consequences. \"If your motivation is simply because you have stepped on six continents already and you want to step on the seventh \u2013 personally I think that's a fairly frivolous reason.\"  Bergstrom also suggests would-be travellers think twice. \"If what you really want is to connect with snow and ice and you're in the northern hemisphere, can you catch a train to the nearest snow region instead?\" she said. \"Or if you really want to make this trip, then look at trade-offs. Look at how much carbon you will use and consider how you can save on carbon elsewhere [in your life].\" Thoughtful Travel is a BBC Travel series that helps people explore places responsibly and sustainably, all while making them better through regenerative and responsible travel. ---\u00a0 Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

            "text": "The UK population could reach nearly 74 million by 2036 with net migration fuelling the rise, figures suggest. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) projects the population will increase by 6.6 million people (9.9%) between 2021 and 2036. This includes a net migration of 6.1 million people and about 500,000 more births than deaths. The figures say there could be an additional one million people aged 85 and over in the UK by 2036. A Number 10 spokesman said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak thought legal migration had been too high and that it \"must come down quickly.\" The projected population growth to about 73.7 million, from the latest estimate of 67 million, is faster than the previous calculation and comes after net migration to the UK hit a record 745,000 in 2022.  The figures suggest the UK population could hit 70 million by the middle of 2026 - a decade sooner than projections published in 2022. During the period between mid-2021 and mid-2036, the ONS's projections suggest: ONS projections are used to calculate the likely demand for housing and public services.  Statisticians are now working on the assumption that from 2028 net migration will contribute 315,000 extra people to the UK per year, an increase greater than the population of Doncaster. Home Secretary James Cleverly has announced that planned restrictions on foreign care workers bringing dependants to the UK will come into force on 11 March.  Additionally, the minimum salary required for those arriving on skilled worker visas will rise from \u00a326,200 to \u00a338,700 on 4 April.  Mr Cleverly said: \"I've been clear that migration is too high and we must get back to sustainable levels.  \"Last year I set out robust measures to reduce the numbers coming into our country, tightening the rules on care workers, skilled workers and making sure that people can support their family members that they bring over.\" Tom Pursglove, minister for legal migration, said the measures would make a \"tangible difference\" and showed the government was \"already acting in response to these sorts of figures\".  But Stephen Kinnock, Labour's shadow immigration minister, said the latest figures reflected \"14 years of Conservative failure on the economy and immigration\".  \"Labour would reform the points-based immigration system to boost training and better link it to the needs of the economy,\" he added.   The projections also put renewed pressure on Mr Sunak from Tory critics, with Downing Street resisting calls from former home secretary Suella Braverman for a cap on legal migration numbers. Robert Jenrick, who quit as immigration minister over the Rwanda policy, said the projected population growth would \"deepen the housing crisis\".  James Robards, the head of population at the ONS, said: \"Our projections, which use assumptions based on current and past trends, are not predictions. \"If migration comes down, then so will our assumptions for use in future projections.\" The ONS's projections also show an increasing number of older people in the UK. By 2036, the size of the UK population aged 85 years and over is projected to increase from 1.6 million (2.5% of the total population) to 2.6 million (3.5%).",

            "text": "A giraffe named Benito has left his home in Mexico's arid north to begin a 2,000km-trip (1,200 miles) to more temperate climates further south.  Benito's voyage follows a long campaign by activists who warned that he was suffering in the extreme climates of the border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. To reach his new home, Benito is travelling in a purpose-built 5m-tall container.  Some activists shouted \"we love you\" as he began his trip.  Until his departure, the three-year-old Benito had been kept in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez's Parque Central zoo. Activists had long warned that the city's desert climate - which can reach a a sweltering 42C (108F) in the summer and dip as low as freezing in the winter - was difficult for giraffes and that the zoo was not properly equipped to handle the animals.  A second giraffe which was kept at the zoo, Modesto, died in 2022.  The operation to move Benito began early on Monday morning, when the container in which he will travel was loaded onto a truck.  Benito had been allowed to familiarise himself with the container over the weekend.  The container is designed so that he can peek his head out from inside but can be covered with a tarp to protect him from the elements and potentially stressful sights and sounds.  The trip to his new home - a safari park in the state of Puebla - is expected to take approximately 50 hours.  Frank Carlos Camacho, the director of the safari park where Benito is headed, said that the container had cameras and sensors installed to allow his keepers to monitor him, as well as enough alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and water to keep him fed along the way.  \"We can check his temperature, and even talk to him through a microphone that's inside the container,\" Mr Camacho said. \"He's very well.\" At his new home in Puebla's African Safari park, visitors will be able to see him in a more natural habitat from all-terrain vehicles.  In an interview with Mexico's Animal Politico news outlet, activist Perla Iris Guzm\u00e1n - a member of the \"Let's Save Benito\" collective -  thanked \"all the people who made this movement grow\".  \"This is an accomplishment of the entire Ju\u00e1rez community,\" she said. \"[They] believed in us and went to the zoo to see what we meant about the 'little' animals.\" ",

            "text": "The boss of Boeing has admitted the planemaker was at fault after one of its aircraft suffered a door blowout shortly after take-off in the US.  No-one was injured when the unused cabin door broke away from the Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon on Friday. The US has grounded 171 of the Boeing 737 Max 9 planes since the incident.  On Tuesday, Boeing's president and chief executive Dave Calhoun said the firm was \"acknowledging our mistake\". The door \"plug\" which fell away from the aircraft weighed 27kg (60lb) and was used to fill an emergency exit that was built into the plane, but not required by Alaska Airlines.  The missing section of the plane was retrieved from the back garden of a Portland teacher, according to the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). It has also been revealed that the airline placed restrictions on the aircraft following pressurisation warnings in the days before the incident, investigators have said. Speaking to Boeing staff, Mr Calhoun said: \"We're going to approach this number one acknowledging our mistake. We're going to approach it with 100% and complete transparency every step of the way.\" Mr Calhoun reassured staff that Boeing would work with the NTSB to investigate the cause of the accident.  \"They will get to a conclusion\u2026 the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] who has to now deal with airline customers who want airplanes back in service safely and to ensure all the procedures are put into place, inspections, all the readiness actions that are required to ensure every next airplane that moves into the sky is in fact safe and that this event can never happen again,\" he said. The Boeing boss also empathised with those who watched with horror at the footage of the incident: \"When I got that picture, all I could think about - I didn't know what happened so whoever was supposed to be in the seat next to that hole in the airplane. I've got kids, I've got grandkids and so do you. This stuff matters. Every detail matters.\" Inspections of Boeing 737 Max 9's are continuing after the FAA said its first priority was \"keeping the flying public safe\".",

            "text": "\"I see greatness in this company, but I also see opportunities to do better. Much better.\" These were the words of Boeing chief executive David Calhoun on his first day in the job, back in January 2020. He was appointed in the aftermath of two tragic crashes involving Boeing's newest and fastest selling airliner, the 737 Max, in which 346 people died. Four years later, Boeing is facing an investigation from the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, for potentially having failed to ensure its aircraft \"were in a condition for safe operation\". The company will also be subjected to increased oversight and new safety assessments, following a clampdown announced by the new head of the FAA, Mike Whitaker. The credibility of the aerospace giant, and its boss, are on the line following another serious incident involving an airliner from the 737 Max family.  No-one was seriously hurt when an unused door blew off an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 last week shortly after take-off. But it could have been much, much worse. Inspections have already revealed loose bolts and fixings on other planes of the same specification - raising questions about the way they were built. Mr Calhoun told staff this week that Boeing would acknowledge its \"mistake\" and would approach the investigation with \"100% and complete transparency\". That mistake has cast a harsh spotlight on Boeing's commitment to safety and the performance of the 737 Max itself. In commercial terms, the aircraft has been a clear success. Some 1,370 have been delivered to customers so far, and another 4,300 are on order. Flight 1282: The Blowout Every passenger's worst nightmare: the terrifying moment a plane door rips away mid-air. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) The aircraft is popular with airlines because it is much more efficient than the previous generation of 737, has low running costs, and offers an alternative to Airbus's rival A320 neo. But behind the scenes, there have been serious problems, including manufacturing defects affecting parts of the fuselage, tail and rudder assembly, as well as sealants applied as protection against the effect of lightning strikes in the central fuel tank.  Some of these flaws were attributed to Boeing's supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. The Kansas-based company builds major parts for the 737 Max, including fuselages. It also produced the door that fell off the Alaska Airlines plane. A shareholder lawsuit lodged late last year accused the company of deliberately attempting to cover up serious defects. Spirit says it \"strongly disagrees\" with those assertions and insists it will \"vigorously\" defend itself against the claims. \"Ultimately, the buck stops with Boeing,\" says Bjorn Fehrm, aeronautical analyst with Leeham Co. \"When they build the fuselage and put in the interior, the insulation, the walls and so on, they are obliged to check that the supply from Spirit is correct. The quality assurance has to be made by Boeing.\" Concerns have also been voiced about the number of malfunctions that have occurred on aircraft in service. Publicly available information shows that by September last year, US carriers alone had reported more than 1,300 faults on 737 Max planes.  Although some of these were relatively minor, there were also potentially serious problems with flight management computers, autopilots, engines and other critical systems. The Foundation for Aviation Safety, a group led by former Boeing manager and whistleblower Ed Pierson, has been analysing the data. It says it finds the reports \"troubling, and the industry's complacency towards them even more disturbing\". It claims that because the planes have been operating for a relatively short amount of time, \"the overwhelming majority of these reports point directly to production quality defects\". \"I do think there is a fundamental cultural problem at Boeing,\" says Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general of the US Department of Transportation. \"They just don't realise how vulnerable they are to these kinds of quality control problems, and that jeopardises safety around the world where these planes operate.\" Over the past five years, Boeing has repeatedly stressed its commitment to putting safety at the heart of its operations.  When asked about the quality control issues, and its safety culture, a company spokesman referred the BBC to Mr Calhoun's comments this week, in which he pledged to co-operate with investigators and regulators \"to ensure all the procedures are put into place, inspections, all the readiness actions that are required to ensure every next airplane that moves into the sky is in fact safe and that this event can never happen again\". In the wake of the two previous accidents involving the 737 Max, off Indonesia in late 2018 and in Ethiopia in 2019, Boeing admitted misleading regulators and concealing information about the aircraft's safety. It avoided prosecution by agreeing to pay fines and compensation worth $2.5bn (\u00a31.8bn). Relatives of those who died aboard the Ethiopian plane say the latest incident suggests little has changed at the company in the past five years. Nad\u00e8ge Dubios-Seex lost her husband Jonathan in the crash, leaving her to bring up three children alone.  \"They absolutely haven't learned anything,\" she says. \"Nothing has been done. We're still in the corporate culture that's putting defective products out there.\" Zipporah Kuria, whose father Joseph Waithaka was killed in the same accident, agrees. \"I don't think Boeing has changed. I think this incident is a marker and an indicator of lack of change,\" she says. \"They say history repeats itself when we fail to learn from it - and here we are yet again.\" Against this background, Boeing has been working hard to get two new versions of the 737 Max, the relatively small Max 7 and the much larger Max 10, into service. In order to do so, it has requested a temporary exemption from safety rules recently introduced to prevent anti-icing systems from causing potentially catastrophic damage to engine inlets. Such an exemption would leave the new planes in exactly the same situation as existing 737 Max models, which are already obliged to use their anti-icing systems in a restricted manner to avoid problems occurring, but are otherwise able to operate normally. However, if the Alaska Airlines affair prompts regulators to take a harsher line with the company, experts say Boeing may find it harder to get the exemption it wants, potentially delaying the introduction of the new models.  That is just one extra headache facing the chief executive, as he attempts to deal with the aftermath of last week's incident.  So has Mr Calhoun lived up to his promises to make Boeing \"better\"? \"I think he's tried,\" says analyst Bjorn Fehrm. \"There is change at Boeing. But over the past five years we are only seeing the result of two and a half decades of mismanagement. To come back and rebuild a culture\u2026 is a long process.\"",

            "text": "On 24 January 1984, the Apple Macintosh 128K personal computer was unveiled to the world, but 40 years later it still has a loyal following of fans \u2013 and users. David Blatner still has practically every Macintosh computer he ever bought. But one in particular stands out \u2013 the first. He remembers the neat way the screen was laid out; the glossy manual; the cassette tape tutorials explaining how to use the machine. It was everything he felt a computer should be. He had seen early iterations of personal computers as a young child. He used to ride his bicycle to Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in California where his stepfather worked in the 1970s. There, Blatner got to try early personal computers such as the Alto, which had a graphical interface and a mouse. \"A computer that would work for a single person \u2013 that was, in itself, mind-boggling,\" remembers Blatner, who is now president of CreativePro Network, an online resource for creative professionals. But it would take another decade before he got one of his own \u2013 with the arrival of the Apple Macintosh. On 24 January 1984, a man called Steve Jobs got up on a stage and heaved a beige box out of a carrying case, shoved a floppy disc into it, and stood back. As the theme from Chariots of Fire played, the word \"Macintosh\" swept across the tiny computer's screen and a series of monochromatic images flashed up. The captivated audience \u2013 of Apple shareholders \u2013 went wild. By today's standards, the tiny screen, boxy form and rudimentary graphics of the original Macintosh look ludicrous. The device was not even the first personal computer. But it was, arguably, the first to change the world. And Steve Jobs\u2019 flashy launch day presentation, at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California, became a template for his many later appearances introducing subsequent Apple hardware \u2013 including the iMac and iPhone. Today, the Mac 128K \u2013 so called because it came with 128kb of Random Access Memory, or RAM \u2013 is a museum piece. Apple stopped producing the computers in October 1985 and discontinued software support for them in 1998. But a handful of diehard fans still use their Mac 128K computers today \u2013 although not without frustrations. The machines are extremely limited due to their small amount of memory. If you want to check out the 128K's specifications, Apple actually lists them on its website. Even with its diminutive memory, no modem or ability to connect to the internet, and rudimentary graphics, there is a community of avid fans who delight in poring over this seemingly ancient hardware. David Greelish, a computer historian in Florida who is releasing a documentary about the 128Ks predecessor the Apple Lisa this month, notes the ingenuity of the 128K's original circuit board. \"It's got everything: ROM, RAM, processor and all the input-output,\" he says. \"Everything there in a beautiful little integrated square board. For 1984, it was amazing.\" The original Macintosh can still sell for as much as a modern computer. And for collectors they are a piece of computing history, with the signatures of the team who built it moulded into the plastic of the rear casing. Some Mac 128K owners, however, use the devices to play quirky games like Frogger or Lode Runner on their treasured machines. All in black and white. The first Macintosh with a colour screen, the Macintosh II, only arrived in 1987. The Centre for Computing History in Cambridge, England, is one of many collections that feature a functioning 128K. \"It\u2019s 40 years old and it\u2019s still going,\" says Lisa McGerty, chief executive, who remembers the introduction of Macintosh computers as a \"massive\" improvement for people in the printing and publishing business. Apple's graphical printer, the ImageWriter, was released shortly before the 128K. McGerty\u2019s colleague Adrian Page-Mitchell, collections officer, says it\u2019s not always easy to keep these decrepit Macintoshes functioning. An earlier 128K that had been on display for a long time at the Centre for Computing History eventually failed and \"couldn't be fixed\", he says. Sometimes Macs show their age in strange ways. Steven Matarazzo, a YouTuber and computer collector, says that one of the machine\u2019s capacitors can sometimes degrade over time, meaning that the 128K's screen won\u2019t work properly \u2013 it'll appear slightly squished. Last year, he published a YouTube video about an apparent prototype version of the 128K that turned up. It wasn't working so its owner asked Matarazzo if he could take a look at it. Before long, Matarazzo had the device functioning again. He studied every inch of this early Mac in detail, enthusing about tiny differences between it and the version that made it to market \u2013 such as the little Apple logos imprinted on the rubber feet of the prototype. Those weren\u2019t there in the final design. It\u2019s a bit like archaeology for gadgets, he explains. \"You try and put this together \u2013 what was the process here, how early was this, how late was this?\" he says. \"That is, especially to me, what is really cool.\" The Apple II and the Apple Lisa, which predated the 128K, were also intended as intuitive, highly capable devices. But each had their own flaws or limitations \u2013 the Apple II did not come with a graphical user interface or mouse and the Lisa was much less affordable compared to the 128K, for instance. By the time the 128K launched, Blatner was finishing high school and looking for a computer to take to college \u2013 something as capable as those machines he'd seen at Xerox years before. His parents took him shopping and they soon found a 128K on display at a shop in downtown Palo Alto. \"It had menus, it had folders, it had a graphical user interface, it had a mouse \u2013 it was everything I thought a computer ought to be,\" he recalls, adding that he still has the receipt. The device cost his parents $2,495 and, at college, Blatner was soon showing it off to his fellow students. They used to queue up behind him in his dorm for a chance to try the computer out. \"I have a file cabinet with all these crazy things we were printing out at college,\" he says. \"People just loved it.\" It was no coincidence that this technology echoed Blatner\u2019s earlier experiences with computers at Xerox. Jef Raskin, who initiated the Macintosh project \u2013 and named the computer after his favourite variety of apple \u2013 had also seen the same Xerox technology and been inspired by it. Not only that, in December 1979, Jobs and a handful of Apple engineers toured Xerox multiple times. This gave them ideas that would later shape both the Lisa and Macintosh. In exchange for those impactful demonstrations, Xerox received a large volume of Apple shares, which they quickly sold, losing out on potentially billions of dollars had they held onto them. Famously, Jobs ended up taking over the Macintosh project started by Raskin after getting kicked off the Lisa team. By this point, Jobs had developed a vision for an affordable personal computer and he decided that the Macintosh would help him make it a reality. Among the things that made Macintosh different was its presentation. It wasn't just a personal computer, it was a computer with personality. Susan Kare, a graphic designer, came up with cartoon-like icons that practically anyone could understand, and she also contributed to the Macintosh\u2019s collection of digital fonts. But so much about the Mac and the splash that it made was fuelled by marketing and hype. Jason Scott, a filmmaker and historian of technology who works at the digital archive non-profit Internet Archive, remembers seeing the original TV ad for the Mac 128K as a teenager. The bizarre short film was directed by Ridley Scott and depicted a dystopian future inspired by the novel 1984. What would save us all from that dark future? The Mac 128K, of course. \"That commercial began playing and it seemed like it was completely from Mars,\" recalls Scott. \"Something was going on but I didn't quite understand it.\" Not long after, when Scott tried a Macintosh for the first time, he was enraptured. It was, he says, like looking through a telescope to another world. And yet the Mac was not as big a success as some expected. \"It didn\u2019t sell to businesspeople like Steve thought it would,\" remembers Andy Cunningham, who worked on the marketing campaign for the device. \"It\u2019s ultimately why Steve got fired from Apple.\" Jobs left in 1985 but returned to the company in the late 1990s. It took until 1988 before Apple had sold enough Macintosh devices, including various subsequent iterations of the original Macintosh, to finally eclipse sales of the Apple II, which had come out way back in 1977. But Macs did appeal to many, especially young people and those working in creative roles. Cunningham and her colleague Jane Anderson helped to pump up hype over the original Macintosh by offering individual journalists six hours each with people at Apple, including Jobs, and giving them multiple demonstrations of the machine to ensure that they understood what they were writing about. \"I watched them all play with this computer and their eyes just glistened,\" says Cunningham. It would be wrong to suggest that the Mac 128K was a perfect computer. As mentioned, it had severe limitations and was hardly a commercial hit at first. But it left an indelible mark. The rise of personal computing was undoubtedly a watershed moment. The ridiculously oversized, cabinet-like computers that you could only plug into via a clunky terminal now seemed hopelessly antiquated. Now we had portable, cheerful, accessible machines that almost anyone could use. Funnily enough, the era of individualised computing heralded by the original Macintosh is, in one sense, coming to an end. In the 21st Century, we are becoming ever more dependent on server farms, cloud processing, big data, and networked systems. Other people\u2019s computers are increasingly indispensable for running our own. \"We are now on the other side,\" reflects Blatner, who has kept almost every Macintosh he ever bought. \"We did need this 40-year period of enabling people, of empowering people.\" -- If you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

            "text": "The US aviation regulator has said 171 Boeing 737 Max 9 planes will remain grounded until it is satisfied the planes are safe. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been inspecting the jets after part of an Alaska Airlines plane's fuselage fell off on Friday. The FAA said its first priority was \"keeping the flying public safe\". Boeing's CEO Dave Calhoun told staff that its response \"is and must be\" the focus of the company. Thousands of passengers saw their flights cancelled after major US airlines grounded dozens of the jets. \"We have grounded the affected airplanes, and they will remain grounded until the FAA is satisfied that they are safe,\" the FAA said in a statement on Sunday. Boeing also said that it will hold an all-employee meeting about safety on Tuesday to address its response to the incident. \"When serious accidents like this occur, it is critical for us to work transparently with our customers and regulators to understand and address the causes of the event, and to ensure they don't happen again,\" Mr Calhoun said. Disruptions have primarily affected flights in the US. The vast majority of Boeing 737 Max 9s used in the US are operated by United Airlines and Alaska, while Turkish Airlines, Panama's Copa Airlines and Aeromexico have also grounded jets of the same model for inspections. Alaska grounded 65 planes, and said on Sunday that it had cancelled 163 flights, or 21%. Around 25,000 people were affected. The airline said travel disruptions from the grounding of some of its planes is expected to last until at least mid-week.United has grounded 79 planes, and said on Sunday it had cancelled about 180 flights.  Meanwhile, authorities are still searching for the plug door - which they believe fell to the ground in the western suburbs of Portland - and have appealed to the public to help find the panel. During Friday's incident, Alaska Airlines flight 1282 from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, reached 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began an emergency descent, according to flight tracking data. Passengers on board said a large section of the plane's outer shell fell to the ground shortly after take-off.  Images sent to news outlets show the night sky and lights of Portland visible through the gap in the fuselage, with insulation material and other debris also seen. One passenger said the gap was \"as wide as a refrigerator\" while another said a child's shirt was ripped off in the wind as the plane made its emergency landing. The plane, carrying 177 passengers and crew, landed safely back in Portland. Alaska said several passengers were injured, but not seriously. Boeing's 737 Max has been described as \"the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history\" after a series of safety issues. The Max was grounded in March 2019 for a year and a half after two of the type crashed in similar circumstances to each other, killing those on board. More recently, Boeing said it would increase the pace of 737 Max deliveries after resolving a supply error that required it to conduct lengthy inspections of new planes and its inventory. About 1,300 737 Max aircraft have been delivered to customers, Boeing data shows. Last month, the FAA urged airlines to inspect Max models for a possible loose bolt in rudder control systems.",

            "title": "Boeing shares stumble after mid-flight blowout",
            "text": "Shares in Boeing have slumped after one of its planes was involved in a dramatic mid-air blowout in the US.  A cabin panel tore off a 737 Max 9 flown by Alaska Airlines, forcing an emergency landing and prompting safety officials to ground the same-make jets installed with the affected door plug. The US plane-maker's shares ended Monday trading down 8%, while shares in supplier Spirit Aerosystems fell 11%. The incident added to quality questions facing the firms.  \"It's more about the whole perception of Boeing as an operator and its long-term safety record,\" John Grant, chief analyst at the aviation analytics firm OAG, told the BBC's World Business Report programme. \"You have lots of individual incidents that are adding up to a very long catalogue of problems for Boeing and indeed for their airline customers\u00a0who need to use these aircraft.\" Boeing has been trying to emerge from the shadow of two high-profile crashes involving a different 737 model, the Max 8, in 2018 and 2019, which killed 346 people. Boeing started developing the 737 Max in 2011 as a more fuel-efficient option for short and medium-length flights.  It has been popular with airlines but dogged by questions about quality arising from electrical faults, loose bolts and other issues, some of which have also involved Spirit AeroSystems. Before the emergency near the Portland, Oregon airport, the firms' history had already drawn the attention of safety campaigners. After the incident, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded 171 of the fleet of more than 200 737 Max 9 planes for inspection, leading hundreds of flights on Alaska, United and other airlines to be cancelled. United on Monday said preliminary inspections had uncovered instances of installation issues related to the door plug - \"for example bolts that needed tightening\". The news sent shares lower in afternoon trading. Analyst Mr Grant said the industry generally had been having supply chain issues and struggling to deliver planes on time, leading to pressure to move more quickly.  \"You just sense that perhaps something has slipped in Boeing and it's been like that for a couple of years and they haven't got to grips with it,\" he said.  \"Boeing are really going to come back under the microscope again.\" Boeing said earlier Monday that the assembly under review was not found on other Max jets and that it was committed to safety and working with regulators. Spirit AeroSystems, which made and installed the part, had named a new chief executive in October. It said in a statement on Monday that its \"primary focus\" was \"the quality and product integrity of the aircraft structures we deliver\".  \"We are grateful the Alaska Airlines crew performed the appropriate procedures to land the airplane with all passengers and crew safe,\" Spirit said in its statement. \"Spirit is a committed partner with Boeing on the 737 program, and we continue to work together with them on this matter.\"  The plane involved in Friday's emergency had been cleared to fly and put into service a few months ago. Alaska Airlines staff had flagged it for pressurisation issues and the airline had restricted it from long flights over water. Since the 2018 and 2019 accidents, arch-rival Airbus has taken the crown of world's top plane-seller, expanding its market share against Boeing. Shares in the European firm rose more than 3% in trade on Monday.",

            "title": "Alaskan Airlines flight 1282: Key questions behind door plug blowout",
            "text": "Alaska Airlines flight 1282 was on a routine flight from Portland in Oregon to Ontario in California, when an unused cabin door broke away a few minutes after take off.  The section that fell from the sky was a 27kg (60lb) part of the shell. Known as a door plug, this was used to fill an emergency exit that was built into the plane but not needed by Alaska Airlines. The cabin abruptly depressurised, creating a rush of air that ripped off the flight crews headsets and sent phones and other items flying out of the plane. The aircraft was delivered to Alaska Airlines on 31 October 2023, and would only have completed around 100 flights a month. Normal wear and tear or maintenance failures are unlikely to have been factors affecting such a young aircraft.  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSF), which is investigating the accident, has already said it does not suspect a design flaw. In fact, this type of door has been used on older Boeing 737s since 2006, and has not suffered any serious issues. That means the focus is likely to be on whether the door itself could have been faulty, and whether it was bolted in place correctly.  Alaska Airlines says it has since inspected other planes of the same type - Boeing 737 Max 9s - and discovered \"some loose hardware\". Meanwhile, United Airlines says bolts in need of \"additional tightening\" have been found while inspecting the relevant parts of its own fleet of 737 Max 9s.  The door was produced by Boeing's supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which has previously faced criticism for serious quality control failures. But Boeing itself has been accused in the past of chaotic conditions in its factories and corners being cut on the production line.  Boeing insists that is not the case today, and emphasises that safety is its first priority. The discovery of the missing door will provide vital clues for investigators about what went wrong and why.  The 737 Max 9 has been ordered by many different airlines. The way they use those planes will not always be the same, and there are different options available for seating.  The number of emergency exits required depends on the number of seats. With a less crowded cabin, it can operate with four main doors, and another four smaller exits over the wings.  But if configured with the maximum number of seats, a further two exits are required - midway between the wings and the tail of the aircraft.  In practice, Boeing builds all its Max 9 airframes with these extra doors. If they are not required, a non-operational door, or \"plug\" is fitted, concealed behind the interior trim.  The light that came on in the cockpit is known as an \"auto pressurisation fail\" light. It comes on when the pressure in the cabin, which is usually regulated automatically, changes at an unusually fast rate. The crew can respond by adjusting the cabin pressure manually, or if concerned by descending to a lower altitude. However, such warnings can also appear due to minor faults. In the case of the Alaska Airlines plane, the light had come on during several flights over a short period.  The issue had clearly been reported to maintenance staff, whose response would have been dictated by the aircraft's maintenance manual.  This is a document written by Boeing, but signed off by regulators. Restrictions were placed on where the plane could fly, and according to the NTSB additional investigations had been ordered, but had yet to be carried out when the failure occurred. In the immediate aftermath of Friday's accident (this is the term used by the NTSB), Alaska Airlines grounded its entire fleet of 65 737 Max 9 aircraft.  However, on Saturday 18 planes were briefly allowed back into service. Those planes had recently undergone major overhauls, including inspections of door plugs. No problems had been found and the company believed they were safe.  But when the Federal Aviation Administration issued an airworthiness directive banning affected aircraft from flying until they had undergone specific checks, it had no option but to ground all 18 planes once again.  The NTSB is carrying out a full investigation. This will involve, for example, examining the plane itself, the lost door (which has now been found in a back garden in Oregon), the contents of the flight data recorder and maintenance records, as well as interviewing flight crew, maintenance staff and employees of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems. The purpose of the investigation is to find out what went wrong and why. It is not meant to apportion blame.  However, there is clear jeopardy here for Boeing. The 737 Max is its bestselling aircraft, a favourite among airlines because of its low running costs and fuel efficiency.  But its safety record has already been badly tarnished as a result of two accidents that occurred in late 2018 and early 2019, in which 346 people were killed. The aerospace giant insists it is a different company today. In a message to staff, chief executive Dave Calhoun said \"when serious accidents like this occur, it is critical for us to work transparently with our customers and regulators to understand and address the causes of the event, and to ensure they don't happen again.\"",

            "text": "Thousands of passengers face flight cancellations after major US airlines grounded dozens of Boeing jets after a mid-flight blowout over Oregon. The US aviation regulator said 171 Boeing 737 Max 9s must be grounded for checks after part of an Alaska Airlines plane's fuselage fell off on Friday. Alaska said flight disruptions are expected to last into next week. United Airlines has grounded 79 planes. Disruptions are likely to primarily affect flights in the US. It follows regulator the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordering \"immediate inspections\" of 737 Max 9s worldwide. Required inspections would take around four to eight hours per aircraft, it said. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is following the FAA approach, but flight disruptions on the continent are expected to be minimal. EASA said it believes no European airlines operate Max 9s with the configuration covered by the FAA order. One of the world's largest intercontinental airports, London Heathrow, said there was no impact on flights. The bulk of the affected planes are owned by US airlines. United Airlines has grounded all 79 of its Max 9 planes.  Alaska said it cancelled 160 flights on Saturday, affecting about 23,000 passengers. Other airlines which also fly the planes have temporarily taken them out of service.  Boeing said it welcomed the FAA's decision, adding its teams were in close contact with the regulator. During Friday's incident, Alaska Airlines flight 1282 from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, reached 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began an emergency descent, according to flight tracking data.

The plane, carrying 177 passengers and crew, landed safely back in Portland. Alaska said several passengers were injured, but not seriously.  \"My heart goes out to those who were on this flight - I am so sorry for what you experienced,\" Alaska's CEO Ben Minicucci said after the firm volunteered to ground 65 of its 737 Max 9 planes. \"I am so grateful for the response of our pilots and flight attendants,\" he added. Alaska later said that, as of Saturday afternoon, it had cancelled 160 flights. The airline said on Saturday that 18 of its Max 9 planes - about a quarter - had received \"in-depth inspections as part of heavy maintenance checks\" and were returned to service, but following the FAA's orders these have since been \"pulled from service\". \"We are in touch with the FAA to determine what, if any, further work is required before these aircraft are returned to service,\" Alaska said in a statement. It added: \"The aircraft involved in flight 1282 was delivered to us on 31 October. The part of the aircraft involved in this event is called a plug door - a specific panel of the fuselage near the rear of the aircraft.\"  The rear mid-cabin exit door is used in dense seating configurations on some Max 9 planes to meet evacuation requirements, but is \"plugged\" on other planes, including the Alaska flight.  United Airlines says it has carried out the inspections required by the FAA on some of its 737 Max 9 planes. Removing some of its aircraft from service was expected to cause about 60 cancellations on Saturday, the airline said in a statement. Turkish Airlines has grounded five of its 737 Max 9s. Flydubai said its three 737 Max 9s were not affected as they had a \"different configuration\" compared to the Alaska Airline planes and have completed recent safety checks. British regulator the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said there are no registered Boeing 737 Max 9 planes in the UK and therefore the impact would be \"minimal\". \"We have written to all non-UK and foreign permit carriers to ask for confirmation that inspections have been undertaken prior to any operation into UK airspace,\" a CAA spokesman said. In the US, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has taken charge of the Alaska investigation and its chair confirmed no passenger had been sat next to the affected section. \"We are very, very fortunate here that this didn't end up in something more tragic,\" Jennifer Homendy said.  Meanwhile, authorities are still searching for the plug door, which they believe fell to the ground in the community of Cedar Hills, about 11 km (seven miles) west of central Portland. Boeing's 737 Max has been described as \"the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history\" after a series of safety issues. The Max was grounded in March 2019 for a year-and-a-half after two of the type crashed in similar circumstances to each other killing those on board. Aviation expert John Strickland said the Alaska Airlines incident was very different to those crashes, adding that since the 737 Max came back into service it had \"a very good safety record\". \"While we know little evidence of why this section of the fuselage has come out - this has nothing to do with the aircraft being grounded for 18 months,\" he told BBC News. \"But, it is natural Alaska Airlines is taking a cautious approach grounding its fleet\" More recently, Boeing said it would increase the pace of 737 Max deliveries after resolving a supply error that required it to conduct lengthy inspections of new planes and its inventory. About 1,300 737 Max aircraft have been delivered to customers, Boeing data shows. Last month, the FAA urged airlines to inspect Max models for a possible loose bolt in rudder control systems.",

            "text": "Two phones and a \"door plug\": these are some of the items found in Oregon days after Alaska Airlines flight 1282 lost part of its fuselage at 16,000 feet. The Boeing 737 Max 9 made a safe emergency landing on 5 January after an outer section of the plane blew off minutes into the flight from Portland. None of the 177 people on board were seriously injured in the incident. But the search continues for other lost belongings and parts, thought to include a cushion from the seat immediately next to the blown-out section of fuselage - which was thankfully unoccupied. One of the key missing items, the door plug, was found by a local school teacher named Bob, according to US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chair Jennifer Homendy. The discovery came after officials from the NTSB asked the public for help finding the door plug - a 27kg (60lb) piece of fuselage with a window, that can be used as an emergency exit in certain configurations. They believed the door could have landed around Barnes Road, near Oregon-217 and the Cedar Hills neighbourhood, based on radar data. During a news conference, Ms Homendy said Bob sent in a picture of the missing piece, which ended up in his backyard in Portland. \"I can just see the outside of the door plug from the pictures, the white portions,\" Ms Homendy said. \"We can't see anything else but we're going to go pick that up and make sure that we begin analysing it.\" \"Thank you Bob,\" she added. The NTSB has since recovered the door plug from the teacher to aid in its ongoing investigation into the incident.  Taking a walk near Barnes Road, another man claimed he found a \"perfectly intact\" iPhone believed to belong to a passenger. Sharing photos of his discovery on X, formerly Twitter, game designer Sean Bates said the NTSB told him it was the second phone to be found. Mr Bates' photos show the stretch of Barnes Road where he said he found the phone, along with a picture of it - no cracks to be seen, but with a broken-off piece of what used to be a white phone charger still attached to it. He joked that it was possible that the phone's airplane mode feature being turned on helped it survive the 16,000ft (4,876m) drop. \"It was still pretty clean, no scratches on it, sitting under a bush and it didn't have a screen lock on it,\" Mr Bates said in a TikTok video. \"I opened it up and it was on airplane mode with a travel confirmation... so I had to go call the NTSB.\" The device appeared to display an email receipt for a $70 (\u00a355) checked baggage charge for the flight. Several passengers have described their fear during the incident, which happened shortly after take-off en route to Ontario, California. Evan Smith, one of the 171 passengers on board, said: \"There was a really loud bang towards the left rear of the plane and a woosh noise - and all the air masks dropped. \"They said there was a kid in that row who had his shirt sucked off him and out of the plane and his mother was holding onto him to make sure he didn't go with it.\" Jessica Montoia, another passenger, described the flight as a \"trip from hell\", adding that a phone was taken out of a man's hand by the wind. It is unclear whether that phone is the same Mr Bates found on his walk. Around 171 Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft remain grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as safety checks continue. Meanwhile, investigators have said the specific Alaska plane involved in Friday's incident experienced pressurisation warnings in the days before.",

Speaking at a news conference, Ms Homendy said pilots reported pressurisation warning lights on three previous flights made by the specific Alaska Airlines Max 9 involved in the incident. The decision to restrict lengthy flights over water was so that the plane \"could return very quickly to an airport\" in the event the warnings happened again, the NTSB chief added. It is not clear if there is a link between the issues that led to those warnings, and the issue that caused the blowout on 5 January.  \"An additional maintenance look\" was requested but \"not completed\" before the incident, Ms Homendy said.  The plane was brand new having been delivered to Alaska Airlines in October - at which time it was judged by the FAA to be airworthy.  Ms Homendy also used the conference to set out new details of the \"very chaotic\" and \"terrifying\" situation on board Alaska Airlines flight 1282. The force of the blowout caused the door of the cockpit to open and a laminated checklist and the first officer's headset both flew out into the cabin, she said. She added that no information from the cockpit voice recorder was available, as the recording had been automatically wiped after a two-hour cut-off was reached. The NTSB wanted this window to be increased to 25 hours, she added. Ms Homendy later announced that the part of the fuselage that detached had been found, after a teacher named Bob located the missing section in his backyard. \"I'm excited to announce that we've found the door plug,\" she told reporters. \"Thank you, Bob.\"  The plug is a piece of fuselage weighing 27kg (60lb), with a window, that can be used as an emergency exit in certain configurations. Authorities had been searching for it in Portland, the departure city. Ms Homedy said it was the \"key missing component\" to work out why the blowout happened.  Two mobile phones believed to have fallen from the aircraft are also reported to have been found.  An Oregon man shared an image of an iPhone which he said he had discovered, working as normal, in a grass verge beside a road. The device appeared to display an email receipt for a $70 (\u00a355) checked baggage charge for the flight. Flight 1282 reached 16,000ft (4.8km) when it began its emergency descent on Friday evening, according to flight tracking data. Images shared online - and later by investigators - showed a wide hole in the side of the craft, with oxygen masks dangling from the ceiling. One passenger, Diego Murillo, said the gap left by the missing component was \"as wide as a refrigerator\". Passengers were quoted by The Oregonian newspaper as saying that a young boy seated near the affected area had his shirt ripped off by the force of the decompression. Alaska Airlines said in its most recent statement: \"While we await the airworthiness directive (AD) inspection criteria from the FAA and Boeing, our maintenance teams are prepared and ready to perform the required inspections of the mid exit door plugs on our 737-9 Max fleet. \"The 737-9 Max grounding has significantly impacted our operation. We have cancelled 170 Sunday flights and 60 cancellations for Monday, with more expected.\" Boeing said in a statement: \"Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers.\"  The company's 737 Max has been described as \"the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history\" after a series of safety issues. In late 2018 and early 2019, two of its aircraft were lost in near identical incidents, off the coast of Indonesia and outside the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. A total of 346 people were killed. Both crashes were caused by flawed flight control software, which ultimately forced the planes into catastrophic dives, despite the best efforts of the pilots. After Friday's incident in the US, the European Union's regulator followed the example of its US counterpart. But it expected disruption to be minimal as it believed no European airlines used Max 9s with the configuration covered by the FAA order. Icelandair said it was not affected. The real-time flight-tracking website Flightradar24 confirmed that a number of the airline's Max 9s were in the skies on Monday morning.  The bulk of the affected planes are operated by US operators - 79 of them by United Airlines and 65 by Alaska - which has meant disruption for thousands of passengers.",

            "text": "The full programme of events to commemorate the loss of 36 Hull trawlermen at sea 50 years ago has been announced. The Gaul trawler was lost off the coast of Norway in February 1974. The programme, which runs from 8-15 February, includes a memorial rugby match, live music and boxing. Jerry Thompson, chairman of the Hull Fishing Heritage Centre, said organisers aim to make sure the crew's loss is remembered. When it disappeared, the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes, four other British ships, three Norwegian ones and 19 trawlers searched for the Gaul but failed to find it. A formal investigation concluded it had capsized after being struck by a series of large, heavy waves. However, it spawned a number of alternative explanations and conspiracy theories, including that it had been captured or sunk by a Soviet submarine, been a spy ship, or been accidentally sunk by a Nato submarine. The wreck of the Gaul was not discovered until 1997 when the then deputy prime minister and Hull MP John Prescott ordered surveys that eventually discovered the remains of some of the crew. The Gaul 50 steering group chairman, Daren Hale, and Ruth Creasy of the STAND fishing heritage charity said Hull was united in marking the loss of the 36 trawlermen. The sinking, which claimed the lives of 30 Hull trawlermen and six from North Shields, was dubbed the worst ever single-trawler tragedy at the time. Events to mark the tragedy include a civic service at Hull Minster, the unveiling of two new murals and evenings of music and boxing. They will begin with a memorial event that includes a minute's silence at 11:00 GMT on 8 February and the ringing of the Gaul Bell outside the Hull Fishing Heritage Centre. Hull City will mark the tragedy at its game against Swansea City on Saturday 10 February. It will also be commemorated at the Hull FC and Hull KR derby the following Thursday, after the official series of events concludes. The programme has been organised by Hull City Council's St Andrews and Docklands ward councillors, Hull Minster, Bullnose Heritage, the Fisherman's Mission and STAND. Mr Thompson told the Local Democracy Reporting Service it was important to mark the loss of the brave trawlermen. A spokesperson for the Fishing Heritage Centre said: \"Families lost loved ones and dear friends were taken from our community. \"We owe it them to ensure they are never forgotten.\" Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

            "title": "Boeing's mid-flight blowout a big problem for company",
            "text": "It could have been a great deal worse.  The incident that befell Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 on 5 January would have been terrifying for passengers, but ultimately no-one was seriously hurt and the aircraft landed safely. However, the picture could have been very different if the failure had occurred further into the flight. It happened minutes after take-off from Portland International Airport while the aircraft - a Boeing 737 Max 9 plane - was still climbing. An unused emergency exit door blew out, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the fuselage. The plane suffered a rapid loss of cabin pressure, as air rushed out and the atmosphere within the plane equalised with the thinner air outside. The impact of this was reduced by two key factors. First of all, the passengers would all have been wearing seatbelts at this stage in the flight, keeping them in their seats. Secondly, data from aircraft monitoring sites show that the plane reached a maximum height of around 16,300ft before descending quickly. The cruising height of a 737 Max is around 38,000ft. At this level, the difference between the pressure inside the aircraft and the atmosphere outside is much greater. Had the door blown out here, the sudden rush of air would have been much more violent, and potentially lethal, especially if passengers were not wearing seatbelts. \"Passengers in the seats immediately adjacent, or in other seats around it who weren't wearing a seatbelt could have been sucked out of the aircraft\", explained Tim Atkinson, an aviation consultant and former aircraft accident investigator. \"I guess the worst case could be you lose a row full of people and a couple of others standing nearby as well.\" The temperature in the aircraft would also have dropped dramatically. Air at such altitudes is typically very cold, around -57C  (-71F).  Passengers and crew would have been reliant on emergency oxygen. Without it they would have quickly lost consciousness. Jennifer Homendy, chair of the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), said it was \"very, fortunate here that this didn't end up in something more tragic\". In 2018, exactly such an incident occurred to an older model of Boeing 737 being operated by Southwest Airlines. Debris from an engine failure broke one of the cabin windows while the plane was travelling at 32,000ft. The aircraft suffered a sudden decompression, and one passenger was partially sucked out of the window. She died as a result of her injuries. The immediate concern in this case is whether what happened to Flight 1282 could happen to other aircraft. The door in question is meant to be securely bolted to the fuselage using four bolts. The aircraft was only two months old, meaning simple wear and tear is unlikely to have been a factor.  That is why Alaska Airlines initially chose to ground its fleet of 737 Max 9s.  The US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) followed suit, temporarily grounding 171 aircraft for inspections. \"It could be design, it could be a manufacturing defect, or a combination of the two. Or it could be something else, something unknown\", said Mr Atkinson. The NTSB has revealed that pilots had seen a pressurisation warning light come on during previous flights, and that the plane had been restricted from making long journeys over water as a result. It has warned, however, that this might not be connected to the incident itself. An expert on 737 aircraft suggested to the BBC that the repeated appearance of such a warning light would certainly have been taken seriously. In addressing it, airline technicians would have followed the aircraft's maintenance manual - a document drawn up by Boeing but signed off by the regulator. He added that there are also indicator lights on the flight deck to warn when individual doors are not properly closed, but because the door that went missing was not in use, that particular warning light would not have been operational. The investigation is expected to involve both Boeing and its supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, which actually manufactured the door. For Boeing, there is an additional problem. The aircraft involved in the incident was a variant of the 737 Max, the latest generation of Boeing's 737 workhorse. The plane, designed to be much more fuel efficient than previous models, has been a hit with airlines. But its safety record has been badly tarnished. In late 2018 and early 2019, two aircraft were lost in near identical accidents, off the coast of Indonesia and outside the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. A total of 346 people were killed. Both crashes were caused by flawed flight control software, which ultimately forced the planes into catastrophic dives, despite the best efforts of the pilots. Those incidents led to the grounding of the global 737 Max fleet for more than 18 months while the problem was rectified and further safety checks were carried out. The head of the FAA subsequently described the design as \"the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history\". However, since the 737 Max came back into service, there have been a number of high profile problems with the programme, including electrical faults and quality control issues, some of which have also involved Spirit AeroSystems. Safety campaigners have also expressed concern about the number of reported malfunctions aboard aircraft that have gone into service. In December, Boeing called on airlines to inspect rudders on their aeroplanes, after a bolt was found to be missing on one aircraft. It said it was acting \"out of an abundance of caution\". In the wake of the accidents, Boeing faced widespread accusations of putting profit above the safety of passengers. Whistleblowers claimed the company was putting undue pressure on its employees to build too many aircraft too quickly, leading to chaotic conditions in its factories, and corners being cut on production lines. Boeing insists it is a different company today. Its chief executive, David Calhoun, has repeatedly emphasised its commitment to the highest standards of safety, quality and integrity. However, some critics remain unconvinced. Ed Pierson is a former senior Boeing manager who warned about problems on the 737 Max production line before the two crashes. He now heads an organisation called the Foundation for Aviation Safety, which has been scrutinising the aircraft's record. He insisted that conditions inside Boeing's factories have not improved, and that the US regulator has been ineffective in holding the company to account. \"This is just a gigantic wake-up call\", he said. \"This might just be a major blessing to have such a highly visible incident occur that will cause them to have to admit they have some serious problems.\" Boeing has consistently denied such problems exist.  In a statement issued after the FAA ordered the most recent groundings, the company said: \"Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers. We agree with and fully support the FAA's decision to require immediate inspections of 737-9 airplanes with the same configuration as the affected airplane.\" Boeing is in the process of ramping up production of the 737 Max to cut waiting times for customers and reduce its backlog of orders. Arguably, the timing of this latest incident involving its flagship aircraft could not have been worse.  Whatever the cause, it is likely to create further anxiety around the already-damaged 737 Max brand, particularly among passengers.",

            "title": "Garda age limit: How old is too old to join a police force?",
            "text": "The Irish police force, An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, announced this week it is raising its upper age limit for recruits from 35 to 50. People on the cusp of half a century can now compete for a place at the Garda College, alongside candidates as young as 18. It follows a legal case taken by two men who successfully claimed they were victims of age discrimination as they could not apply to join after the age of 35. But the rule change also comes amid an ongoing police shortage -  the force recently failed to meet a workforce target of 15,000 officers by 2021. Its current membership is just more than 1,000 short of that target. The move has faced opposition in the past, notably from the head of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, Commissioner Drew Harris, who argued the age limit was necessary to ensure officers are physically able for the job. However, the low cut-off point was out of step with other nearby forces - the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) accepts applications from candidates up to 57, while the Metropolitan Police's age limit is also \"typically\" 57. Police Scotland has no upper age limit. Having recently celebrated his 50th birthday, County Donegal Garda (police officer) Brendan O'Connor would now be too old to apply for the job he has held since he was 24. As well as being a front-line officer in Dunfanaghy, he is also president of the Garda Representatives Association (GRA), a union-like organisation which promotes the interests of rank-and-file officers. Mr O'Connor told BBC News NI he does not object to widening the recruitment age bracket, but argued it will not fix staff shortages. \"We don't believe there's a pool of people in that age group who would be in a position financially, or with family commitments, to take that option,\" he said. \"Of course, anyone who meets the criteria and can do the job will be welcome, but we don't believe it's going to be any significant part of the solution to the problems we face.\" He explained officer numbers are being depleted by early retirements and \"an unprecedented level of resignations\". The GRA president believes money will be the biggest deciding factor in how many middle-aged candidates apply. \"We imagine that most people in that age bracket may have financial commitments, may have dependents, may have mortgages, and will possibly be be seeing a significant drop in their income if they were to start training.\" The starting salary for a newly qualified garda is just over \u20ac35,000 (\u00a330,000) in a  country with extremely high housing costs. Recruits must also spend their first 36 weeks in the Garda College on a training allowance of \u20ac305 (\u00a3262) a week, well below minimum wage levels. Justice Minister Helen McEntee said this \"significantly increased\" payment followed the government's allocation of \u20ac2.3bn (\u00a32bn) to the force for 2024 - its highest ever annual budget. She added the age limit change would open policing \"to a new cohort of people who will bring a range of different life and career experiences to the table\". But Mr O'Connor said the \u20ac305 allowance was \"wholly inadequate,\" and a \"paltry sum for anyone to try to exist on with the cost-of-living crisis\". In terms of the age limit, the GRA president accepts it is \"part of the inevitable evolution of the workplace\". He also believes it may be linked to the successful age discrimination challenge. That long-running battle was fought by Ronald Boyle, who was 48 when he sought to join the garda\u00ed in 2005, and Brian Fitzpatrick who was 37 when he wanted to apply in 2007. The pair won their case in 2020 when the Workplace Relations Commission ruled they had been discriminated against on age grounds. That ruling was appealed by the Department of Justice and the Garda Commissioner but that was rejected last year. Mr Harris had defended the age limit of 35 as \"essential\", telling the Labour Court garda\u00ed needed operational resilience to protect the people of Ireland. He listed several duties requiring a high level of physical agility, pointing out the force is responsible for national security, counter terrorism and major crime investigation. The commissioner said officers required the stamina to be as alert at the end of a shift as they are at the start. But Mr Boyle told the Labour Court he was still physically fit - one of his jobs was as a swimming instructor. The court ruled in the men's favour, saying the age limit of 35 was \"not appropriate or necessary\". But fitness is still essential for all front-line officers who may have to chase down suspects or quell a riot like the one that erupted in Dublin last November. Under the new Garda regime, middle-aged recruits must pass a physical fitness test alongside their teenage competitors.  However, the tests are adjusted based on age and gender.  As Mr O'Connor points out there are \"lots and lots of garda\u00ed in their 50s being very effective\" in their roles. \"Fifty-year-olds can do the job - I'd like to think I can do the job,\" he said. \"I mean, it's getting more and more challenging the older you get - shift work and stuff like that.  \"But individuals look after themselves, have good health and certainly there's nothing prohibiting a 50-year-old from doing the job.\" He also acknowledged older recruits could bring \"a wealth of experience\" to the Garda\u00ed, as they already do in other forces.  \"Only time will tell whether this will make any difference, but we don't believe it's the solution to our current recruitment and retention crisis,\" he added.",

            "text": "The US airline regulator has ordered the grounding of some Boeing 737 Max 9 jets after part of one plane fell off during an Alaska Airlines flight. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the inspections would affect 171 planes. On Friday the Alaska Airlines flight had to make an emergency landing after take-off from the US state of Oregon. United Airlines says it has carried out the inspections required by the FAA on some of its 79 Boeing 737 Max 9 planes. Removing some of the aircraft from service was expected to cause about 60 cancellations on Saturday, the airline said in a statement. Earlier, the FAA said it would \"order the temporary grounding of certain Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft operated by US airlines or in US territory\".  Required inspections would take around four to eight hours per aircraft, it said. Turkish Airlines has also recalled its five planes of that model for checks.  In Friday's incident, the Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to Ontario, California, had reached 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began its emergency descent, according to flight tracking data. The airline, carrying 177 passengers and crew, landed safely back in Portland. The chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is investigating the incident, confirmed on Saturday that nobody had been sitting next to the affected section. \"We are very, very fortunate here that this didn't end up in something more tragic,\" Jennifer Homendy said.  She added that investigators believed the door that came off the plane was now in the Cedar Hills neighbourhood in Portland and urged anyone who found it to contact local police.  Meanwhile, the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) confirmed that there were no UK-registered 737 Max 9 aircraft.  \"We have written to non-UK and foreign permit carriers to ask inspections have been undertaken prior to operation in UK airspace,\" it wrote on X, formerly Twitter.  Images sent to news outlets of the affected area showed the night sky visible through the gap in the fuselage, with insulation material and other debris also seen. There were no immediate indications of the cause of the apparent structural failure, nor any reports of injuries. Passenger Evan Smith said: \"There was a really loud bang towards the left rear of the plane and a woosh noise - and all the air masks dropped. \"They said there was a kid in that row who had his shirt sucked off him and out of the plane and his mother was holding onto him to make sure he didn't go with it.\" In an audio clip, the pilot can be heard talking to air traffic control requesting a diversion. \"We are an emergency,\" she said. \"We are depressurised, we do need to return back.\" According to photographs, the affected area was in the back third of the plane, behind the wing and engines. The section of fuselage involved appears to be an area that can be used as an additional emergency exit door by some operators, but not by Alaska. Terry Tozer, a former airline pilot who has written extensively on aviation safety, said the section should have been bolted into place if it was not being used as an emergency exit.  He told the BBC News Channel that the passengers would not have been able to tell the area was not a normal window from inside the cabin.  While the loss of this section would probably not have affected how the aircraft flew, Mr Tozer added, there would have been a \"huge risk\" to anyone sitting nearby. Announcing the initial grounding of 65 planes, Alaska Airlines' CEO Ben Minicucci said: \"Each aircraft will be returned to service only after completion of full maintenance and safety inspections.\" A later statement said that more than a quarter of those planes had been inspected and would return to service as there were no issues found. In a statement, Boeing said it supported the FAA's decision. and was co-operating with the National Transportation Safety Board's investigation of the Alaska Airlines incident. \"Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers,\" Boeing said. It is the latest problem involving Boeing's best-selling model, which was grounded for almost two years following crashes in 2018 and 2019. ",

            "text": "A footballer was killed in a nightclub as a \"planned act of retribution\" after a minor altercation in a late night bar on Christmas Eve, a court heard. Ex-Stratford Town player Cody Fisher, 23, was fatally stabbed at the Crane club in Birmingham on Boxing Day 2022.  Two days earlier, a \"coming together\" of Mr Fisher and defendant Remy Gordon in a busy bar was the catalyst for the attack, jurors heard. Mr Gordon and two other men all deny murder at Birmingham Crown Court. The 22-year-old of Cofton Park Drive, Birmingham, and Kami Carpenter, 21, and 18-year-old Reegan Anderson, both of no fixed address also all deny affray. Mr Fisher, of Redditch, had played for a number of non-league Midlands clubs, most recently for Southern League Premier Division Central club Stratford Town. Opening the case for the prosecution, Michael Duck KC told jurors that the three men were part of a joint attack in which they \"knew of knives and were encouraging and assisting others\".  It led to Mr Fisher being stabbed in the chest, with the blade penetrating the main valve of his heart, leaving him fatally wounded, Mr Duck said. He was \"rendered helpless\", with his girlfriend and others trying to help him as medical help was sought and administered. Despite being given medical aid, Mr Fisher died on the dancefloor, the jury heard. But \"not satisfied with the murderous attack\", the group pursued Mr Fisher's friend and also \"perpetrated a very significant act of violence\" on him by knocking him to the floor and kicking him repeatedly, Mr Duck said.  Jurors were told the men had taken such \"awful revenge\" after a minor altercation two days earlier, on Christmas Eve. Mr Gordon was with a friend in Popworld in Solihull, when he encountered Mr Fisher, who was also there with a friend, Mr Duck said. The defendant and Mr Fisher had come into contact in the \"packed\" bar, angering Mr Gordon, the court was told. Mr Gordon had decided to challenge Mr Fisher about it, using it as an excuse to threaten him with violence and to take it outside, the court heard. But they remained inside the venue before Mr Fisher, \"who had done nothing wrong\" and showed \"no hint of violence\", made his way out of the bar with his friend, Mr Duck said. Referring to Mr Gordon, the prosecutor said: \"The strength of his resentment can be gleaned from messages sent within about 50 minutes of the encounter in Popworld.\" The jury heard Mr Gordon allegedly sent messages on Snapchat to friends around 45 minutes after the initial encounter, appealing for help to identify a photograph showing Mr Fisher and threatening to \"shank him up\". \"The prosecution say within three-quarters of an hour of that minor incident taking place in Popworld, you see the way Remy Gordon felt about it and what he intended to do about it,\" Mr Duck said. He was \"set on retribution\", which would come two days later, jurors heard. In the hours before going to Crane, jurors were told of Snapchat messages between Mr Gordon and Mr Carpenter where they talked about whether masks can be worn and if weapons can be taken in. Mr Carpenter asked Mr Gordon if he can \"get my shank in\", which the prosecution said was reference to a knife. Mr Gordon said he was \"looking to snuff someone\", which Mr Duck said demonstrated his \"sinister intention\" that evening. The conversations showed Mr Gordon was intending to go to the club in disguise, had discussed which weapons to take and that they should inflict very serious harm or could kill an individual, he said. \"He intended to revisit events on Christmas Eve and Cody Fisher's fate was determined by how he reacted to Mr Gordon's approach,\" he said. Mr Gordon was searched at the door of Crane by security but his man bag was not, the court heard. Once inside, he messaged Mr Carpenter to say \"not even a metal detector\". It was difficult to provide another explanation for that conversation, Mr Duck said. \"It was not a matter of chance [Mr Fisher] was attacked in the nightclub, it was not a flash of temper, it was a planned act of retribution,\" he added.

            "text": "Bolts in need of \"additional tightening\" have been found during inspections of Boeing 737 Max 9s, United Airlines has said. United Airlines said \"installation issues\" relating to door plugs would be \"remedied\" before the aircraft type would return to service. Inspections began after a section of the fuselage fell from an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 on Friday. Alaska Airlines says it has since found \"some loose hardware\" on some Max 9s. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which regulates air travel in the US, has grounded 171 planes of the same type. United said: \"Since we began preliminary inspections on Saturday, we have found instances that appear to relate to installation issues in the door plug - for example, bolts that needed additional tightening.\" The door plug is a piece of fuselage, with a window, that fills the space where an emergency exit would be in certain configurations. It was this part of the Alaska Airlines plane which dramatically fell off mid-flight over the US state of Oregon, eventually landing in a teacher's back garden. The aircraft made an emergency landing but none of the passengers or crew were seriously injured. The plane's door plug was recovered from a teacher's backyard in Oregon and was found without the four bolts, the National Transportation Safety Board said on Monday night. Its chair Jennifer Homendy told reporters that it's possible the bolts were missing from the start but they may have come off in the descent. The vast majority of Boeing 737 Max 9s used in the US are operated by United Airlines and Alaska, while Turkish Airlines, Panama's Copa Airlines and Aeromexico have also grounded jets of the same model for inspections. United said it had cancelled 200 flights as of Monday and expected significant cancellations on Tuesday.  \"We have been able to operate some planned flights by switching to other aircraft types, avoiding about 30 cancellations each on Monday and Tuesday,\" United added. Alaska Airlines said that initial reports from technicians preparing its 737 Max 9 fleet for inspection indicated \"some loose hardware was visible on some aircraft\". \"When we are able to proceed with the formal inspection process, all aircraft will be thoroughly inspected in accordance with detailed instructions provided by the FAA in consultation with Boeing,\" it said. \"Any findings will be fully addressed in a matter that satisfies our safety standards and FAA compliance. The formal inspections will also require documenting all findings and those will be reported to the FAA. No aircraft will be returned to service until all of these steps are complete.\"  Earlier, the FAA said it had provided a checklist for operators to adhere to during inspections.  The FAA said all 737 Max 9 aircraft would remain grounded until operators \"complete enhanced inspections which include both left and right cabin door exit plugs, door components, and fasteners\". \"Operators must also complete corrective action requirements based on findings from the inspections prior to bringing any aircraft back into service,\" the statement added. Flight 1282 reached 16,000ft (4.8km) when it began its emergency descent on Friday evening, according to flight tracking data. Images shared online - and later by investigators - showed a wide hole in the side of the craft, with oxygen masks dangling from the ceiling. Passengers were quoted by The Oregonian newspaper as saying that a young boy seated near the affected area had his shirt ripped off by the force of the decompression. The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is leading an investigation into the incident, said pilots had reported pressurisation warning lights on three previous flights made by the specific Alaska Airlines Max 9 involved in the incident. The jet had been prevented from making long-haul flights over water so that the plane \"could return very quickly to an airport\" in the event the warnings happened again, NTSB chief Jennifer Homendy said. It is not clear if there is a link between the issues that led to those warnings, and the issue that caused the blowout on 5 January.  Alaska Airlines said in its most recent statement: \"While we await the airworthiness directive (AD) inspection criteria from the FAA and Boeing, our maintenance teams are prepared and ready to perform the required inspections of the mid exit door plugs on our 737-9 Max fleet. \"The 737-9 Max grounding has significantly impacted our operation. We have cancelled 170 Sunday flights and 60 cancellations for Monday, with more expected.\" Boeing said in a statement: \"Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers.\"  The company's 737 Max has been described as \"the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history\" after a series of safety issues. In late 2018 and early 2019, two of its aircraft were lost in near identical incidents, off the coast of Indonesia and outside the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. A total of 346 people were killed. Both crashes were caused by flawed flight control software, which ultimately forced the planes into catastrophic dives, despite the best efforts of the pilots.",

            "title": "Why the hovercraft's time might have finally arrived",
            "text": "Hovercraft were a quick way to zip across the world's waterways but were noisy and expensive to operate. Could they be about to enjoy a second wind? The 12.30pm midweek hovercraft departure from Portsmouth is already respectably half-full when we step on board. Marketed as the world's only year-round scheduled passenger hovercraft service, the Union Jack-emblazoned machine flies for a thrilling 10 minutes, hovering just inches above the water\u2019s surface. It is the fastest way to reach Ryde on the Isle of Wight, a Detroit-sized island off the south coast of England. A rival vehicle, the FastCat ferry, takes more than twice as long, around 22 minutes. The hovercraft's engines roar (no louder than an airliner on take-off) as its beefy cushion inflates, lifting the vehicle gently five feet (1.6m) into the air. Then, it turns and slides seamlessly into the sea on its dash to Ryde. The 78-seater craft's unique ability to fly over sand and mud without damaging the fragile ecosystems underneath means that passengers may board even at low tide. Hovertravel, which runs this service, is the sister company of Griffon Hoverwork, a British manufacturer that traces its roots back to Sir Christopher Cockerell's invention of the hovercraft in the 1950s. This mode of transport may be more than 70 years old but it could be about to enjoy a second wind. The global rise in sea levels, and the blurring of the boundary between land and sea that will result, is set to grow its niche further. \"It makes you feel very free,\" says Griffon's chief pilot Ben Avery. \"You can climb straight out of the sea onto the sand, and it's one of the few machines that doesn't have anything in the way of automatic control, so you drive it by the seat of your pants. It's all done by feel and reaction. \"The older models, you have got to grab by the scruff of the neck and drive because they have mechanical controls.\" \u00a0 Hovertravel likes to bill this as a unique service but in October 2024, a second year-round scheduled passenger hovercraft service will launch in Japan. \"There are more passenger hovercraft services around the world than people realise,\" says Avery. \"There's quite a lot of passenger services that operate between China and Russia. We've got a customer out in Canada, who operates a year-round service. It's also not scheduled, but it is year-round.\" Fifty-sixty years ago, the hovercraft was the future of transportation. We were promised hoverscooters, hovercars, hovertrains and hoverships. The Ford Motor Car Company unveiled the Ford Mach I hovercar concept and Popular Science, a US magazine, heralded a future of \"Cars Without Wheels\". But when a massive and popular hovercraft that transported people and their cars between England and France retired in 2000, many felt the final curtain had fallen on a technology that hadn't really delivered on all the hype. With the humble hover mower the only mainstream bit of hovercraft technology in existence, it seemed to have become just another dead-end technology. \"Hovercraft were noisy as hell and expensive to operate but there were some advantages to the technology,\" says John Geoghegan, author of White Elephant Technology, a book about failed technologies. \"They were fast and could operate on land and sea. They were also as cool as heck.\" Just down the coast from Portsmouth lies The Hovercraft Museum, overlooked by giant propellers that rise above a new housing estate nearby like an executioner's axe. Adjacent is the massive concrete ramp or apron that runs down to the Solent from the hangars of the old Royal Naval Air Service Lee-on-Solent base. Inside the gates of \"the world's only hovercraft museum\" I find a cornucopia of hovercraft, large and small, military and civilian, in various stages of restoration, as well as two machines from the James Bond movie Die Another Day. \u00a0 The blue and white Princess Anne is a hefty beast. Nearly as long as a Boeing 747's wingspan and as wide as two large sea containers, it is the only surviving example of the SRN.4 (Saunders-Roe Nautical 4), the largest commercial hovercraft ever built. Its air-screw propellers, powered by Rolls-Royce turboprop engines, are the largest in the world at a massive 21ft (6.3m) in diameter. But all the excitement seemed to fizzle out in the year 2000. \"They were only ever designed to last 10 to 20 years but they ended up lasting 30,\" says Alex Walker of The Hovercraft Museum. \"The SRN.4s were using aircraft engines. There was asbestos. The electrical systems. Compliance with the regulations \u2013 or mitigation \u2013 was getting more and more onerous and then there was the abolition of duty free [tax breaks for travellers]. \"By then, [hovercraft] were also competing with the Channel Tunnel, and new ferries, which were easier to use and operate. So, there was no one thing they could do to fix the problem.\" In nearby Trafalgar Wharf, Portchester, a huge metal hangar-like structure known as the Hovercraft Shed because of the machines built there in the past, is the home of Griffon Hoverwork. The company has delivered around 200 hovercrafts in the last 50 years to 41 countries including Canada, New Zealand, Colombia and Japan. The majority of these vehicles have been ordered by militaries. The first thing I see when I step into the shed's cavernous interior is a large, brand new hovercraft surrounded by scaffolding and engineers busy prepping it for its next sea trial. The machine is the last of an order worth more than $32m (\u00a325m) for three hovercrafts to link the city of Oita in northern Japan to its airport across the bay. It is like a stretched version of the HoverTravel craft. Close to half the length of The Princess Anne, it's Griffon's latest example of a new generation of quieter, more fuel-efficient hovercrafts under construction. It uses lightweight materials and two industrial diesel engines to make it competitive with rival high-speed craft such as catamarans. In this case, it is to deliver passengers straight to the doors of the airport terminal across the Oita Bay without the need for a quay or even a connecting bus. Opposite is the jig for the next hovercraft to be built. This will be the first of two smaller machines for the Polish border guard, a repeat customer. \"Everybody seems to think that hovercraft died when the cross-Channel service stopped, but they didn't,\" says Ben Avery. \"The problem was that hovercraft were quite badly mis-sold in the early days, and we still suffer from that legacy today. So we have worked very, very hard to bring the third generation of craft along that aren't the gas guzzlers they used to be, and nor do they leave your ears bleeding.\" Griffon isn't the only company in the world building hovercraft. The Textron shipyard in New Orleans in the US is busy constructing an initial order of 24 (expected to grow to 73) next-generation Ship-to-Shore Connector (SSC) craft for the US Navy and Marine Corps. The vessels have the ability to land on 80% of the world's shorelines and will have an expected service life of 30 years. They are designed to replace a fleet of 91 vessels evolved from an earlier American design from the 1960s. That hovercraft, the Hydroskimmer, was the largest air-cushion vehicle ever built in the United States. Russian and Chinese companies continue to build hovercraft largely for their own markets. The heavily armed Russian Zubr class of air-cushioned landing craft is currently holds the title of largest hovercraft in the world. \u00a0 The Iranians have also been busy building their own, which may be based on British hovercraft designs sold to Iran before the 1978 revolution. Then there are the manufacturers of small or light hovercraft. They often employ one or two people, and don't tend to stay around for long, but some of these start-ups have grown into established businesses. Since 1976, the Indiana-based Neoteric Hovercraft has produced more than 1,000 different hovercrafts of 20 different designs. They are intended for personal use, such as racing, as well as tasks such as search and rescue, environmental studies and \u2013 equipped with magnetometers \u2013 detecting unexploded ordnance, as well as military training. The company's unique selling point is that it manufactures \"the only light hovercraft with the ability to brake and reverse\". The concept of the hovercraft is older than you might think. Hundreds of years ago, boat builders realised that ships could travel much faster if they were able to lift their hull, or part of it, out of the water. The first\u00a0mention of an air cushion vehicle was in 1716. In the 1870s, British shipbuilder John Thornycroft came up with the idea of injecting air underneath his boats to reduce the amount of friction. He was able to prove that his air-lubricated hulls were effective with small models, but the technology wasn't developed sufficiently to work on full-size vessels. In the 1930s, Soviet engineer Vladimir Levkov assembled about 20 experimental \"air-cushion boats\" that he envisaged as fast attack or torpedo boats, including the long, shark-like L-5, which achieved an impressive 81mph (130km/h) in sea trials. In the early 1950s, British engineer Christopher Cockerell decided to channel the air into a narrow jet around the edge of the craft's perimeter, forming a curtain of moving air that would limit leakage. By 1955, he had built a working model of his \"hovercraft\" from balsa wood. He came up with the name, which was later trademarked, meaning that there are certain sensitivities around its use today. Four years after his invention, with the support of the government-backed National Research Development Corporation, Cockerell built the SRN.1, which resembled a flying saucer with a huge air intake in the middle. On 25 July 1959, the 50th anniversary of the first aeroplane flight over the Channel, he crossed the same body of water \u2013 albeit at a much lower altitude. The SRN.1 struggled to overcome waves, so his solution was a rubber skirt around the rim of the craft to boost its height.  Only 10 years later, much larger hovercrafts were in service, ferrying cars across the Channel. The British inventor wasn't alone in seeing the potential of air-cushion vehicles. American engineers also realised their usefulness, but the craft they designed, built, and sold were largely overshadowed by rival British models. \"I was sitting at home watching television when I was quite young in 1959, and I saw the SRN.1 crossing the Channel \u2013 and that's what got me interested in hovercraft,\" says Chris Fitzgerald, president of Neoteric Hovercraft. \"But there were many other people finding similar solutions to the same problem. There were people playing with this concept for a long time.\" The era of the eccentric hovercraft inventor isn't over yet. The first hovercraft race was in Canberra, Australia in 1964 but racing \u2013 and cruising \u2013 hovercrafts continues to be popular. Competitors are often innovators who work on their vehicles in their garden sheds and garages. \"Racing is how my parents met \u2013 and I've been going since I was born,\" says Hannah Deacon, marketing director of the Hovercraft Club of Great Britain (HCGB), and runner-up in the 2022 Formula 50 World Hovercraft Championship in Sweden. \"At races you don't talk about what you do outside of racing. You just focus on fixing the craft, making it better, making it go faster, getting back out there and trying it out. You might also like: \"We are worried about the carbon emissions from racing,\" adds Deacon. \"So it's great to see that electric hovercraft are now being developed. But this kind of innovation is horribly expensive for individuals.\" The future of the hovercraft is clear. It is unlikely there will ever be another huge machine like The Princess Anne. \"But climate change is happening and we're getting more intertidal zones,\" says Avery. \"So there will be more rescue craft, more survey vessels; and more craft will be needed that have this amphibious ability. We have built one hybrid craft already, and we will see hovercrafts that are fully electric and even hydrogen powered.  \u00a0\"The niche hovercraft operate in is only going to grow.\" --  If you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

            "text": "A US lunar lander has \"no chance\" of making a soft landing on the Moon due to a fuel leak, the company behind the mission says. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic said there was enough propellant to operate its Peregrine lander as a spacecraft.  The lander is expected to run out of fuel in about 40 hours, the firm said shortly after 17:00 GMT on Tuesday. Peregrine ran into trouble almost as soon as it came off the top of its launch rocket on Monday. \"Given the propellant leak, there is, unfortunately, no chance of a soft landing on the Moon,\" Astrobotic said in a statement posted on X, formerly Twitter.  \"The team has updated its estimates, and we currently expect to run out of propellant in about 40 hours from now - an improvement on last night's estimate.  \"The team continues to work to find ways to extend Peregrine's operational life.\" The 1.2-tonne lander was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 02:18 ET (07:18 GMT) on Monday, with the intention of landing in late February. But in the first few hours of its journey, engineers noticed the would-be Moon lander was struggling to keep its solar panels looking in the direction of the Sun to charge its battery. The cause was quickly attributed to a major leak in the propulsion system that was pushing Peregrine out of alignment. To maintain the correct orientation in flight, Peregrine's thrusters are now having to work overtime, consuming even more of the diminishing fuel supply. Astrobotic calculates the craft has under two days' worth of propellant left before reserves are exhausted and the spacecraft starts tumbling. When that moment arrives, Peregrine, with its solar panels no longer collecting sunlight, will rapidly lose power. Even before Tuesday's announcement from Astrobotic, it had become clear that a touch-down on the lunar surface - the first for the US in half a century - was all but impossible. The US space agency, Nasa, had purchased capacity on the lander for five instruments to study the lunar surface environment ahead of sending astronauts there later this decade. Astrobotic is the first of three US companies to send a lander to the Moon this year under a new private-public partnership with Nasa. Alongside two other commercial ventures - Intuitive Machines and Firefly - they had planned six missions to the lunar surface in 2024.  Nasa believes its new lunar partnership with the private sector will introduce more innovation and reduce costs over time. And the agency says it is prepared for some of these missions not to work. The Peregrine craft was launched aboard the first flight of Vulcan, a rocket that had been under development for a decade by United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.",

Evan Smith, one of the 171 passengers on board, said: \"There was a really loud bang towards the left rear of the plane and a woosh noise - and all the air masks dropped.  \"They said there was a kid in that row who had his shirt sucked off him and out of the plane and his mother was holding onto him to make sure he didn't go with it.\" Diego Murillo said the gap was \"as wide as a refrigerator\". Fellow passenger Elizabeth Lee added: \"Part of the plane was missing and the wind was just extremely loud. but everyone was in their seats and had their belt on.\" Jessica Montoia described the flight as a \"trip from hell\" adding a phone was taken out of a man's hand by the wind. Announcing the initial grounding of 65 planes, Alaska Airlines' CEO Ben Minicucci said: \"Each aircraft will be returned to service only after completion of full maintenance and safety inspections.\"  A later statement said that more than a quarter of those plans had been inspected and would return to service as there were no issues found.  The flight to Ontario, California, had reached 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began its emergency descent, according to flight tracking data. Images sent to news outlets show the night sky visible through the gap in the fuselage, with insulation material and other debris also seen.  Other pictures show the seat closest to the affected section, a window seat that passengers said was unoccupied, leaning forward without its cushion. \"My heart goes out to those who were on this flight - I am so sorry for what you experienced,\" Mr Minicucci said. \"I am so grateful for the response of our pilots and flight attendants.\"  In an audio clip, the pilot can be heard talking to air traffic control requesting a diversion.  \"We are an emergency,\" she said. \"We are depressurised, we do need to return back.\"  According to photographs, the affected area was in the back third of the plane, behind the wing and engines. The section of fuselage involved appears to be an area that can be used as an additional emergency exit door by some operators, but not by Alaska. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 \"returned safely... after the crew reported a pressurisation issue\". Boeing said a \"technical team stands ready to support the investigation\". Flydubai told the BBC that its three Boeing 737 Max 9 had a \"different configuration with mid-aft cabin exits\" compared to the Alaska Airline planes and have completed recent safety checks.  \"We will follow any guidance issued by Boeing once more information is available,\" a spokeswoman added. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident.  The Boeing 737 Max has been described as \"the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history\" after a series of safety issues. The Max was grounded in March 2019 for a year-and-a-half after two of the type crashed in similar circumstances to each other killing those on board. Aviation expert John Strickland said the Alaska Airlines incident was very different to those crashes, adding that since the 737 Max came back into service it had a \"very good safety record\". \"While we know little evidence of why this section of the fuselage has come out - this has nothing to do with the aircraft being grounded for 18 months,\" he told BBC News. \"But, it is natural Alaska Airlines is taking a cautious approach grounding its fleet\" More recently, Boeing said it would increase the pace of 737 Max deliveries after resolving a supply error that required it to conduct lengthy inspections of new planes and its inventory, Reuters news agency reported. About 1,300 737 Max aircraft have been delivered to customers, Boeing data shows. Last month, the FAA urged airlines to inspect Max models for a possible loose bolt in rudder control systems.

            "title": "Japan jet crash: How crew pulled off flawless evacuation from plane inferno",
            "text": "Passengers dashed to the emergency exits of a burning Japan Airlines jet without their hand luggage, in compliance with the flight crew's instructions. The simple act of leaving their valuables behind would be a \"major factor\" behind the speed of the evacuation, with the last person escaping just before the aircraft was engulfed in flames on the runway of Tokyo's Haneda Airport on Tuesday, aviation experts say. Japan Airlines Flight 516 turned into a fireball after it collided with a coastguard plane as it landed. Five of the six people on board the smaller aircraft - which had been due to deliver aid to victims of the powerful New Year's Day earthquake - died. But everyone on Flight 516 survived, with the flawless evacuation from the cabin as it filled with smoke astounding the world and winning praise from many. Aviation experts and industry professionals told the BBC it boiled down to staff on board putting their rigorous training into practice and \"well-behaved\" passengers who obeyed safety protocols. \"I don't see a single passenger on the ground, in any of the videos I've seen, that has got their luggage with them\u2026 If people tried to take their cabin luggage, that's really dangerous because they would slow down the evacuation,\" said Prof Ed Galea, director of the fire safety engineering group at the University of Greenwich in London. To see what happens when passengers try to take their luggage with them, one only has to look back to a crash landing in Dubai in 2016. Footage from inside the Emirates Boeing 777 involved shows people panicking as they clamber to grab their possessions, before they fled down emergency slides. The crew were praised for their efforts to evacuate passengers, and luckily all 300 on board the Dubai flight survived - but the video from inside that aircraft contrasts starkly with the well-drilled scenes witnessed in Tokyo on Tuesday. A former Japan Airlines flight attendant told the BBC that passengers on Tuesday's flight - which had departed from Sapporo's New Chitose airport at 16:00 local time (07:00 GMT) and landed at Haneda shortly before 18:00 - were \"incredibly fortunate\".  In the end, just one passenger on board flight 516 sustained bruises and 13 others requested medical consultations due to physical discomfort, the airline said.  \"I felt relieved to find out that all the passengers were safe,\" the former flight attendant said. \"But when I started thinking about the emergency evacuation procedure, I suddenly felt nervous and fearful. \"Depending on how the two planes collided and how the fire spread, it could have been a lot worse.\" According to the former attendant, all new crew members undergo stringent evacuation and rescue training for up to three weeks before they are allowed to serve in commercial flights. The training - which extends to how you control the tone and volume of your voice so you can be best heard by passengers - is repeated every year. \"We go through a written exam, case study discussions and practical training using different scenarios, such as when the plane has to make a water landing or if there is fire on board. Maintenance staff are also involved in such training,\" said the former flight attendant, who left the airline 10 years ago. On top of this, all aircraft manufacturers must show that everyone aboard can leave the plane within 90 seconds for their planes to be internationally recognised. But even so, in real-life situations, it can be difficult to ensure that passengers do not panic, said the former flight attendant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"What they achieved is harder than one can imagine. The fact that they managed to get everyone to escape is a result of good co-ordination among crew and passengers following instructions,\" she said. A pilot for a South East Asian airline, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, agreed that the flight crew's rigorous training was key to the passengers' escape. \"I must say it was amazing,\" he told the BBC. \"You really don't have time to think in a situation like this, so you just do what you were trained to do.\" It is all the more impressive when you take into account the position and condition of the aircraft, which - according to Prof Galea - would have made the evacuation all the more tricky. \"This accident was far from ideal. The aircraft was nose down, which meant it was difficult for passengers to move,\" he said. Only three inflatable slides could be used to evacuate passengers, but they were not properly deployed because of how the jet landed. The rear slide was very steep, which could have been dangerous. The aircraft's announcement system also malfunctioned during the evacuation, so the flight crew had to convey instructions using a megaphone and by shouting, Japan Airlines said.  But there were also signs the aircraft's design was working to give those on board the best chance of escape. Prof Graham Braithwaite, director of transport systems at Cranfield University in the UK, told the BBC it looked like it \"has done what it is designed to do, which is protect the occupants and allow a fast evacuation\". The role of the airport's fire crews on the ground - who, according to Prof Braithwaite, aim to get to any fire within two minutes - would also have been key in ensuring there was time to escape. \"The fire service focus will absolutely have been on protecting the exits and making sure there was a clear path for people to evacuate,\" he said. The larger fire, he explained, would only have been dealt with after the last person escaped. Lessons have also been learned from the past, with aviation safety regulations significantly strengthened after previous accidents, the pilot told the BBC. For instance, the collision of two Boeing 747 jets at Los Rodeos Airport in Tenerife in 1977 - which killed 583 people and remains the deadliest accident in aviation history - led to a review of cockpit procedures and radio communications. The crash was found to be due to miscommunication between flight crew and air traffic controllers.  An investigation is currently under way into what caused Tuesday's runway collision in Tokyo but, according to transcripts of conversations with the control tower which emerged on Wednesday, the coastguard plane had not been cleared for take-off while the passenger plane was given permission to land. Japan Airlines experienced its own catastrophe in August 1985, when Osaka-bound Flight 123 crashed into a mountain shortly after take-off from Tokyo Haneda. It was later attributed to faulty repair work by Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer. Only four out of 524 people on board survived the crash. The airline's record has been \"blemish free\" since then, Prof Braithwaite told the BBC, and it is a \"world leader\" when it comes to safety. Management at the company are so dedicated that in 2006, Japan Airlines opened a museum-like facility near Haneda displaying wreckage from the incident, aimed at promoting safety awareness among its employees.  \"In face of the pain and grief of the bereaved families and public distrust in airline safety [after the 1985 crash], we pledged that we would never again allow such a tragic accident to occur,\" Japan Airlines wrote on the facility's webpage.  \"Every member of staff is reminded that valuable lives and property are entrusted to us in our work.\" Additional reporting by Mariko Oi Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",

The airplane maker called for the inspections after an international operator discovered a bolt with a missing nut, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said. An airplane's rudder is used to control the aircraft while in flight. \"The issue identified on the particular airplane has been remedied,\" Boeing said.  \"Out of an abundance of caution, we are recommending operators inspect their 737 Max airplanes and inform us of any findings. We informed the FAA and our customers and will continue to keep them aware of the progress.\" The FAA said it was \"closely monitoring targeted inspections of Boeing 737 Max airplanes to look for a possible loose bolt in the rudder control system\". Boeing has recommended that the checks - which take only about two hours - happen within the next two weeks.  Any problems involving a faulty rudder would likely be identified in a pre-flight check, as crews routinely examine the rudder system before flying, Boeing said. Anthony Brickhouse, an air safety expert at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said that airlines \"need to take it seriously\". \"But as a member of the flying public, I don't see this as an issue to be concerned about,\" he told Reuters news agency. Boeing shares were down 1% in midday trade. Boeing's 737 Max was cleared to fly passengers again by US regulators in 2020 having been grounded for 20 months worldwide after two catastrophic accidents killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia.",

            "text": "Pilots of a Japanese airliner that collided with a smaller plane at Tokyo Haneda Airport were initially unaware that their jet was on fire. It was a flight attendant who informed them of the cabin fire, a Japan Airlines spokesperson told the BBC. After that, the evacuation of all 379 on board Japan Airlines Flight 516 proceeded with life-saving precision. Five of six people on board the smaller coastguard plane, a Bombardier Dash-8, died. \"Right after the plane touched down, the pilot felt a sudden shock, and lost control to stay in the runway. A fire took place but the pilots didn't recognise it in the beginning and learned about it [through the] cabin attendant,\" the JAL spokesperson said.  There were three pilots and 12 flight attendants on board when the incident took place. The aircraft's announcement system was damaged, leaving the crew to use megaphones and their own voices to shout instructions. \"The first thing cabin attendants did [after they realised there were] passengers who recognised that their plane was on fire, was to make them stay calm and not to stand up, which could make the escape very difficult.  The announcement system was unusable so these instructions were made without it.\"  Japanese media have described the evacuation as a \"miraculous 18 minutes\". Passengers left their hand luggage, dashed to emergency exits and slid out of the aircraft before it was engulfed in flames. \"[As] smoke started to come into the cabin and spread out... cabin attendants [began shouting] at passengers, [saying]: 'Leave your belongings!', 'Take off your high heels', and 'Head down',\" said the spokesperson.  Their \"co-operation... was [the] key for all passengers [being able] to escape quickly and safely\", they added.  Japanese authorities said late on Wednesday that the coastguard plane was not cleared for take-off on Haneda's runway. The plane was scheduled to deliver relief supplies to earthquake-hit areas. According to officials, the JAL flight was cleared to land on runway 34R at Haneda while the coastguard aircraft was told to \"taxi to holding point C5\" - a place on the airfield's taxiway system where aircraft await permission to enter the active runway for take-off. The transcript shows the coastguard aircraft acknowledged the call from air traffic to taxi to the holding point - its last transmission before the collision. The transcripts appear to contradict the coastguard plane's captain - the only one of the six crew to survive - who told investigators he had been given permission to enter the runway which the JAL airliner was approaching. The BBC has also found information that suggests the series of lights at the relevant holding point may not have been working. But experts point out there are other visual cues like painted markings which would show where aircraft needed to stop short of the runway. The well-drilled scenes on the Japan Airlines plane contrast starkly with aircraft evacuations that fail to strictly adhere to safety protocols. In 2016, an Emirates Boeing 777 crash landed in Dubai and video footage showed chaotic scenes of passengers trying to take their luggage with them as they fled to the emergency slides. The crew were praised for their efforts to evacuate passengers, and luckily all 300 on board the Dubai flight survived. Tuesday's incident is the first major accident involving an Airbus A350, one of a new breed of aircraft built largely of advanced materials such as carbon fibre-reinforced plastic. The aircraft manufacturer is sending a team of specialists to assist in the investigation of the Japan Transport Safety Board.",

            "title": "Letchworth hospice donations keep frail patients out of hospital",
            "text": "A hospice has launched the first scheme of its kind in England, providing beds and ongoing care to frail people who do not have a terminal diagnosis. Garden House Hospice Care in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, wanted to reduce the time patients spent in hospital and prevent stays altogether. The hospice has financed it through a \u00a3300,000 fundraising campaign. One of the first patients, Connie Yearley, 86, said it was \"an excellent idea\". Hospices traditionally help patients towards the end of their lives. However, the new service helps those living with long-term conditions that need medication, patients who have had falls, and helps people with urinary tract infections or who need care after becoming ill.  Mrs Yearley, who used to be a midwife, was transferred from The Lister Hospital in Stevenage after contracting bacterial pneumonia. She is also on the waiting list for hernia repair. \"I've lost mobility and muscle tone, and getting back on my feet doing normal things is going to be a great help,\" she said. If it can attract funding, the hospice hopes to provide ongoing appointments to manage patients, reducing the need for GP visits.   Mrs Yearley said it was \"very, very difficult to get a GP appointment\". She revealed \"she would sooner die than go to A&E again\" after a nine-hour wait on a separate occasion last year for a blocked stoma. In partnership with Lister Hospital, nurses from Garden House visit frailty wards and the emergency department every weekday to pick out patients to safely transfer to hospice beds. Garden House has a team of occupational therapists and physiotherapists for rehabilitation, but another patient, 81-year-old Robert King, said more should be done within the NHS to help patients. \"Years ago people would never go straight home - they'd go to a nursing home to rehabilitate. Somehow that's all disappeared.\" He believed more ideas like this would \"give the NHS a better chance\". But a report by the County Councils network said that employing more physiotherapists to help the frail become mobile in their own homes was just as important as beds. Donations will fund Garden House's service until April. Health officials in Hertfordshire and west Essex said population data predicted in the 25 years up to 2043 there would be a 73% increase in people aged over 85. The local Integrated Care Board oversees healthcare. One of its clinical managers, Dr Mark Andrews, described the statistic as \"quite worrying\". He said: \"This older population with long-term conditions is going to need a lot more support.\" When asked why the NHS was not funding the hospice scheme, he said the system was under \"huge financial pressure\". The hospice also runs weekly exercise groups, using them to identify those needing help. Irene Park, 87, said: \"I came here this morning and someone said 'you look really well' - it's because we come here. There's a guy here who's 100 and he can do more than I can.\" Pat Lade, 85, who is recovering from a mini stroke, added: \"It gets me out, because I live on my own.  \"You sit in a chair all day and you just stiffen up. It is important to keep yourself going, as I don't want to end up in a home or hospital.\" Hospice chief executive Lisa Hunt believed there were thousands of local patients with long-term conditions who visited hospital about 15 times a year. \"By the age of 60, some of us can have as many as eight health conditions, including asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure or heart failure, and often they do not know where to turn,\" she said. \"It is therefore an inevitable side-effect of a system where people with frailty are not being supported, that it's the frail often blamed for bed-blocking and filling up A&E every winter.\" Garden House is the first hospice to provide a specific frailty service incorporating inpatient beds, exercise groups and ongoing care.   The Hospice UK charity said frailty was a cause of death in older people, and those people were less likely to be helped by hospices than advanced cancer patients.  It has been running smaller pilot projects across England to change that. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

Bedfordshire Police dispatched officers to Woodcock Road, Luton, at about 03:10 GMT on Tuesday. The alleged victim, who is in his late teens, was taken to hospital, where he remained in a stable condition. A 23-year-old man and a 17-year-old boy were arrested and remained in police custody, the force said. Officers said they want to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time or who may have doorbell or dashcam footage. Det Insp Jon Wheeler from Bedfordshire Police said: \"I would urge anyone who can assist us to get in touch immediately to shed some light on the situation. \"Knife crime remains an area of concern and priority across the county, but we are working hard to keep Bedfordshire safe by challenging those that choose to carry weapons and use them to incite fear and harm others.\" Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "text": "Thames Water has apologised following \"hugely inconvenient\" supply issues in a town on Boxing Day. It comes as chancellor Jeremy Hunt, MP for South West Surrey, criticised the supplier for the outages in parts of Guildford.  \"I have to say I am beside myself with frustration that this is happening *again* and over Christmas,\" he said in a post on X. Alastair Cochran, interim co-chief executive officer of the water firm, said he was \"very sorry\" for the disruption. Residents in parts of the GU4 and GU5 postcodes have experience no water or low pressure. In another post to X, Mr Hunt said: \"I know many of you are hosting friends and family and this water outage is hugely inconvenient.\" He added he had raised the question of bottled water in impacted areas and requested Thames Water ensured vulnerable people were looked after.  A spokeswoman for the firm said: \"We know how disruptive and inconvenient this can be, especially on a festive holiday.  \"Our engineers are on site and have stopped the flow of water which will reduce the number of properties affected.\" The supplier said it would be carrying out repairs \"as quickly as possible\" and would be using tankers to help keep customers in supply in the meantime. Mr Cochran added: \"As soon as we have an update, we\u2019ll let you know how soon we\u2019ll get things back to normal.\" In November, a major incident was declared after thousands of customers in the Guildford and Godalming area were left without water for several days. Thames Water apologised and said Shalford treatment works in Guildford had faced issues after Storm Ciar\u00e1n.  In response, Mr Hunt and fellow Conservative MP for Guildford, Angela Richardson, organised a public meeting where Mr Cochran said the company had failed to communicate with customers. In June, Sarah Bentley, the former CEO of Thames Water, resigned with immediate effect over the company's poor performance. Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

More than 750 of them ran into the bracing waves from The Stack in Seaburn, Sunderland.  The event, organised by the Sunderland Lions Club and the Red Sky Foundation, has been a tradition at Seaburn since the 1970s.  At England's most northerly beach, at Spittal, Berwick-upon-Tweed, hundreds also took the plunge. Sergio Pettrucci, MBE, founded the Red Sky Foundation after his daughter underwent life-saving heart surgery in 2015. It raises money to buy equipment, such as defibrillators, to treat people with heart conditions. He said: \"It was fabulous to see all these people come down here today to celebrate Boxing Day, it's just what we do best. \"I'm ecstatic with the turn out of people to enjoy a great day. \"The spectators have also turned out in their droves to enjoy it.  \"It's the best feeling in the world seeing all those smiling faces, so if you've missed out this year, get yourself signed up for next year.\" Last year, the event raised more than \u00a340,000 for causes throughout the region with 300 participants. Mr Pettrucci said he hoped that with more than double the participants in 2023, the event would raise even more money.  The Sunderland Lions Club had been running the event since it began, but teamed up with the Red Sky Foundation last year in a bid to attract greater numbers of dippers.  Jacqueline Robson from the club said: \"The dip gives the lovely people of Sunderland and the North East the chance to get out and raise money for charities that are very dear to their hearts.  \"We are hoping to build on the success of this year.\" Peter Spain did the dip to raise money for The Stroke Association in memory of his friend Adam Bosher who died in 2020. He said: \"The conditions were fresh and I got hit in the chest by a big wave which took the wind out of me, but it was great. \"Once you get in it's freezing and it doesn't get any warmer, but it's fantastic.\"  People who turned up at the event in Berwick were entertained by piper Andrew Smith who played as the dippers ran into the water. They were watched by volunteers from the RNLI who were on standby to make sure they were safe.  Follow BBC North East  on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

            "text": "The post-Christmas sales may be getting into full swing, but research suggests shoppers will be spending less than they did last year. Consumers are forecast to spend \u00a33.7bn on Boxing Day, according to research for the VoucherCodes website, which is down 2.9% on a year earlier. Early indications are that the number of shoppers visiting stores on Boxing Day is up slightly on last year. However, Boxing Day sales are no longer seen as the major event they once were. That is largely because of pre-Christmas events such as Black Friday, as well as the availability of early discounts online. This year, major retailers such M&S, Next and John Lewis are not reopening their stores until 27 December. Analysts say the rise in prices over the past year - which has squeezed households' incomes - means people are likely to be cautious in the sales. \"The Boxing Day sales provide shoppers with a last-chance opportunity to splurge on themselves for the year,\" said Anita Naik from VoucherCodes. \"However, this is now a luxury many people are currently refraining from as the nation continues to contend with inflated prices amidst the cost-of-living crisis, therefore it's no surprise that this year, fewer of us will be splashing out in the sales.\" The VoucherCodes report, produced using research from GlobalData, predicts that the amount spent on every day from Christmas Day through to New Year's Eve will be lower than last year. Overall, \u00a313.5bn is expected to be spent over the week, down 3.8% from the year earlier. By 3pm on Boxing Day, footfall among shoppers was up 2.3% compared with a year earlier, according to data from retail research firm MRI Software. This was largely driven by more people visiting High Streets and retail parks. However, compared with 2019 levels, footfall was still down by about 20%. \"This suggests the continued rise of online shopping as many consumers may have started yesterday evening, and with Black Friday only a few weeks ago many will have grabbed their bargains back then,\" the company said. Separate data from Mastercard indicated that spending between 1 November and Christmas Eve was up 2.6% from a year earlier. However, Kien Tan, a senior retail adviser at PwC, told the BBC that many retailers still have \"a lot more stock on their hands\". \"The good news for you and me is there'll be bigger discounts post-Christmas,\" he said. The popularity of the Boxing Day sales has been waning for some time, with Black Friday starting to become the bigger sales event. People are also more likely to spread their spending over the post-Christmas period. \"The changes in consumer behaviour over the Christmas shopping period that we've seen for the last decade will continue this year, with demand from shoppers steadily shifting away from Boxing Day to the three days between 27th and 29th December,\" said Diane Wehrle, chief executive at Rendle Intelligence and Insights. Given the increase in shopping online, Ms Wherle says \"it's no surprise that Boxing Day is less of an iconic day than in the past\". \"For many consumers that do venture out, it is much more of a leisure trip, with the focus on dining out and the top up being the opportunity to browse the shops.\"",

The plane landed off the runway of Zyryanka airport. Initial inquiries said pilot error was to blame, prosecutors said. Thirty passengers and four crew were on board. Flight PI217 left Yakutsk, the capital of the Sakha republic in Russia's Far East, early on Thursday. It was bound for Zyryanka, 1,100km (685 miles) to the north-east, and was due to fly on to another small town in Srednekolymsk before returning to Yakutsk. Video from one of the passengers showed the plane almost in the centre of the frozen River Kolyma in eastern Siberia. Temperatures in Zyryanka dip to around -40C at this time of year. Prosecutors said the plane had landed on a sandbank in the river. A trail in the snow revealed how long it had taken to come to a standstill. ",

            "text": "With a great many of us now trying to lose weight as a New Year's resolution, can artificial intelligence (AI) personal trainers replace human ones? \"I'd never set foot in a gym before,\" says Varun Bhanot, the chief executive of AI fitness software firm Magic AI. \"I found it too intimidating. It's also very expensive, and inconvenient when you've got to travel to get there.\" When Mr Bhanot was told a few years back that he needed to lose weight or face health problems, he transformed his life with the help of a personal trainer - a human one.  But it dawned on Mr Bhanot that advice from an AI fitness chatbot, available to people in their own homes, could make a healthy lifestyle more accessible. So, in 2021, he set up Magic AI. Its main product, the Magic Mirror, is a touch-screen mirror that also plays a video of an AI-powered trainer in human form.  \"When you log in you put in all of your biometric information, and then the AI generates a personalised programme, just like a human personal trainer,\" says Mr Bhanot.  The AI trainer can talk to you via loudspeakers and, using cameras to track your workout movements, it offers instant feedback and suggestions. As you progress it devises new workouts. It comes as the use of AI in the global fitness and wellbeing sectors is continuing to soar. One report estimated that the market was worth $7.8bn (\u00a36.1bn) in 2022, and forecasted that the value would to jump to $35.6bn by 2030. The number of fitness apps that use AI is multiplying and includes Aaptiv, FitnessAI, Fitbod, Freeletics, VI Trainer, and Whoop. Meanwhile, some people are said to be simply asking popular AI chatbot ChatGPT to devise workouts for them. The rise in AI-powered fitness apps suggests that some people feel more comfortable interacting with a computer than they do with a human. While for others it might just be about the convenience of having a fitness coach in their pocket. But can AI really replicate the motivation that comes from human interaction? Pilates teacher and physiotherapist Esther Fox doesn't think so. \"People want to speak to somebody they know and trust,\" she says. \"AI is not something I would particularly want to use.\" The way to get results, Ms Fox says, is by connecting with people. \"When people feel heard and understood, they listen to you - and they do what you want,\" she says. \"It's a very human experience. \"There's a lot of emotional intelligence that goes into health and fitness that you just can't replace with AI.\" By contrast, British sprinter and Olympic bronze medal winner Desiree Henry is one of the voices and bodies of the AI trainers that appear on the screen of the Magic AI fitness mirrors. \"Even if you're doing a home workout alone, it feels like someone is supporting you through the session,\" she says. Mr Bhanot says that the idea is not to replace gyms, but to work alongside them, \"like Netflix and cinema, food delivery and restaurants. AI offers another option for people who value flexibility and convenience\". While most AI fitness apps are designed as a solitary pursuit, now the first gym has opened where people can exercise together, all trained by AI coaches.  Read additional stories on artificial intelligence In Lumin Fitness' darkened studio space in Dallas, Texas, LED screens line the walls from where AI personal trainers guide up to 14 gym goers at a time through personalised workouts or high-intensity interval training. Each person has their own designated station where a screen masks sensors that track both the motions of the exerciser as well as the gym's specially built equipment, including dumbbells, medicine balls and skipping ropes. They then get verbal feedback from the AI, via headphones. \"Sensors in the studio can watch every member of the class, monitoring form, and giving feedback on every movement,\" says Brandon Bean co-founder and chief executive of Lumin fitness. However, a human trainer is also in the room. \"We're not trying to replace the talent of the trainers,\" adds Mr Bean. \"We're giving them tools to provide a better experience.\" \"The coach is so important in building a community. Those in person high-fives, the smiles. There are certain things you can't replicate.\" Physiotherapist Lucy McDonald says that \"if AI is programmed properly, then I can see a huge amount of potential for it to help people to progress their exercises\".  However, she cautions that AI might not always get things right, and so people should still check with a human expert before they risk over-training or injury. Mr Bean argues that AI fitness apps will only continue to improve. \"From an industry perspective, we're very early on,\" he says. \"But one of the brilliant features of AI is its ability to learn. It's not perfect now, but as it learns over time, AI fitness will get better and better.\"",

            "text": "Consumers flock to health, finance and learning companies to reach their goals. These firms are well aware \u2013 and many are seizing the moment to profit. Get fit. Improve mental health. Make a budget. Learn a language.\u00a0 New year's resolutions provide an opportunity for brands to pitch consumers on products or services that will help them achieve their goals. Companies know there's revenue potential, especially in membership-based models; many say the start of the new year is an important time to attract new users whom they hope will convert to long-term active paying customers.\u00a0 \"There are specific spikes in demand for certain products around new year because of resolutions,\" says Neil Saunders, US-based managing director at GlobalData, a consulting firm.\u00a0 If these subscription-based companies can manage the careful balancing act between spending on customer acquisition through discounts and promotions, while considering return on investments in the months to come, they can cash in on the people eager to spend on platforms, services and products that can bring them closer to success. The habits of US consumers serve as an example of how resolutions can be major commercial moments. Analysts say the start of the new year is an important time for health-focused businesses. Nearly half of Americans polled in an October 2023 Forbes Health-OnePoll survey said they were prioritizing fitness in their new year's goals.  \"People have been through the holiday season, they've probably been overindulging,\" says Saunders. \"They're now focused on new year's resolutions to do with wellness and losing weight.\" New York Sports Club, which operates chains of gyms and fitness facilities in the US \u2013 such as popular brands including its eponymous club, Lucille Roberts and Fhitting Room \u2013 says January is a critical time for customer acquisition, with new member sign-ups as high as two-times a typical month. Kari Saitowitz, chief marketing and creative officer of New York Sports Club, says the club banks on the new year's period as new business driver: targets for new sign-ups are two-to-three times the goals for most other months. It's not necessarily a revenue play at first; the company offers discounted memberships for new joiners to get them through the door. Last year, New York Sports Club offered new members a $1 joining fee and complimentary membership for the first month. The long-term profit lies in continued conversion. With the influx of sign-ups, New York Sports Club \u2013 and similar membership-based businesses \u2013 are hoping these new faces will go on to become loyal customers who pay the standard, higher monthly membership fee after joining on a discount.\u00a0 \"The idea is to get people started off with a really compelling offer for January\u2026 you've got to win them over month after month,\" says Saitowitz. At New York Sports Club, a key part of this is ensuring they have free orientation sessions with trainers. They must look at strategy for retention after the new year's rush, too: for instance, she says, the company is in the process of revamping its referral and incentive-based rewards programmes. New York-based Talkspace \u2013 which works directly with consumers and employers to provide mental-health counselling \u2013 says January is a natural time for people to seek out therapy, especially after spending time with family or friends during the holidays. \"November and December are often very slow months for therapy. Clients have a lot going on as the holidays are happening,\" says Liz Colizza, director of research and programmes at Talkspace. \"January comes, and people start to look at their lives differently. Everyone takes a look at what the next year is going to hold.\" At the kick-off of a new year, the company has invested in resolution-related marketing to bring in users. Since 2018, Talkspace has organised ongoing brand campaigns with ambassador and American Olympian Michael Phelps, which help users set new year's intentions and prime them to continue throughout the year \u2013 which the mental-health company, too, hope leads to ongoing business. In January 2023, would-be users were encouraged to engage with an Instagram post from Phelps as part of a contest to win free therapy sessions. \"It's pretty common for us to have some sort of [theme] around, setting your intentions \u2026 thinking about your behaviour and what you want to do in the coming year,\" says Katelyn Watson, chief marketing officer at Talkspace. In Q1 2023, the platform reported a 34% increase in the number of therapy sessions covered by insurance, compared to the prior quarter. Personal-finance platforms often experience similar consumer interest during this time, says Jesse Mecham, founder and CEO of global digital budgeting platform YNAB. \"[With] gyms and personal finance, we share so many relations, where people know that they're not doing it right, and they could be doing better,\" he says. YNAB is a subscription business, billed monthly or annually. The \"New Tear's bump\", as Mecham calls it, can result in around a 25-to-50% boost in new member sign-ups in January. The company typically increases its advertising spend in the lead-up to New Year's Day to capture more interest in the platform. Similarly, Eric Dunn, CEO of personal-finance platform Quicken, says the company typically gets around 15% of its customers in January. New customer revenue, however, represents, only 10% of the company's revenue, with 90% coming from renewals. These re-ups can happen throughout the year, but are weighted more heavily around the first two calendar quarters, with Q1 being the largest renewal quarter, says Dunn. As people also seek personal enrichment, Berlin-based language app Babbel sees an opportunity. \"New year's resolutions are a huge boon to language learning, as with so many self-improvement activities,\" says Julie Hansen, Babbel's US CEO and CRO. The company offers price promotions around the new year, driving a \"significant boost in Q1\", with January being the peak month for US revenue and sales, says Franka Schuster, the company's principal corporate communications manager. Hansen adds, \"For Babbel, January is the largest month of the year by far.\"\u00a0 Duolingo, based in Pittsburgh, US, also offers a discount on its premium subscription only once per year: in January. Consequently, the new year's period is one of the company's biggest customer growth periods of the year, according to Sam Dalsimer, Duolingo's global communications director. Not every company that might see a boost from resolutions uses goals as a marketing tool, however. For global fitness-and-health company Equinox, 2024 marks the second year they are running an anti-new year's resolution campaign called \"We Don't Speak January\", in which they don't allow signups on the first of the year. \"Our members commit to being in our club every day, and so when we look at what the mainstream fitness industry is doing around [1 January] ... they're driving new year's resolutions and using that as a gimmick to sell memberships,\" says Jeff De Korte, chief marketing officer at Equinox. (Some people have criticised the move as a \"stunt\".) Whatever way consumers receive the marketing approach, Equinox still sees strong member uptick for the remainder of the month \u2013 the company says in 2023, Equinox had its largest January sales month in history, approximately 20% higher than January sales prior to the pandemic. And due to the company's membership model of only year-long contracts \u2013 something De Korte says he believes promotes a long-term investment in wellness \u2013 this spike in sign-ups represents a full-year revenue boost. Ultimately, despite the surge in resolution-related business early in the year, sustained revenue isn't a given. Companies that see mass sign-ups still must retain customers \u2013 especially as they drop off when giving up on their new year's goals. \"They're trying to lock customers in, because one of the problems with resolutions is people make them, they kind of stick to them in January and as the year goes on, they kind of fade into the background,\" says Saunders. Especially right now, promotions around the new year's period might be important to some inflation-weary consumers \u2013 but during an economy in which consumers are conscious of their discretionary spending, companies will be eager to see if new members stick with self-improvement, and invest beyond the first quarter of the year.",

            "text": "When you think of cork, you might think of that pop of champagne on New Year's Eve \u2013 but some of this versatile tree bark will also be keeping astronauts safe as humanity returns to the Moon. The space age has brought the world many cutting-edge gadgets and innovative new materials \u2013 from super-strong alloys and memory foam to freeze dried foods and the sensors in your mobile phone camera. Advanced technologies such as these have helped Nasa and its fellow space agencies push ever further into the vastness of outer space. So, it might be something of a surprise to see the next era of space exploration relying on a much humbler substance as humans aim to return to the Moon and even beyond to Mars \u2013 cork. This ancient material \u2013 which is harvested from the bark of trees that grow around the Mediterranean \u2013 is probably most familiar as stoppers in wine and champagne bottles. But its extraordinary properties has seen it used in crucial bits of space rocket hardware and it could come to play an even greater role in years to come. The world is currently witnessing an \"exponential\" growth in space travel as commercial space companies make firing satellites, spacecraft and even people into orbit ever cheaper. But rocket launches can take a considerable toll on the environment, so scientists and space agencies are hoping to find ways of making space flight more sustainable. Many are looking to natural materials as a way of minimising their impact on the Earth and beyond. But are trees really up to the extremes of space? And what does sustainability actually mean to the aerospace industry? Materials that can withstand the extremes of space travel must be able to multitask. They need to be lightweight but also super strong, temperature and radiation resistant \u2013 and even capable of transforming in response to their environment. That's why researchers are experimenting with emerging materials with unusual properties. But they are also reverting to some that have been used by humans for thousands of years. Grown mainly in southern Mediterranean countries, cork has been used by humankind for 5,000 years. In recent decades, it's been used in a multitude of applications from refrigerators to polar research ships and submarines. \"The cork forest is a unique ecosystem,\" says Antonio Rios Amorim, chief executive of Portuguese cork producers Corticeira Amorim. \"It is one of the world's 36 biodiversity hotspots. It contributes to climate regulation, is a driving force for sustainable development and plays a crucial role in the world's ecological balance.\" Corticeira Amorim has been producing cork for more than 150 years, and has been supplying the aerospace industry since the 1960s. \"70% of the cellular structure of cork is air,\" says Amorim. \"For every cubic centimetre you have 40 million cells. This means it's a very light material, and it has extremely strong cell walls. This makes it a very good insulator.\" Cork, he adds, can withstand extreme temperature changes. \"This is not done by us, this is a gift from nature.\" In the 1960s, sheet cork was used to insulate the Minuteman Missiles, the American long-range missiles designed to carry thermonuclear warheads during the Cold War. Boeing used cork mixed with resin in their expendable launch system, Delta IV, due to its anti-charring properties. In 2020, the European Space Agency (Esa), also tested cork as an insulator for re-entry when the Qarman\u00a0satellite was dropped from the International Space Station, gathering data on atmospheric re-entry as it fell back to Earth. And cork is currently used in United Launch Alliance's Atlas V, the main launch vehicle used by Nasa over the past 21 years that has carried robotic missions to Mars and Jupiter. Now, Nasa hopes to send humans to the Moon using a rocket insulated with cork. Nasa's new heavy-lift rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS) accelerates from 0-17,400mph (0-28,000km/h) and soars to more than 100 miles (160km) above Earth in just eight minutes. As it flies, it builds up extraordinary heat. But the cryogenic fuel \u2013 made of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen \u2013 that powers the rocket must remain cold. If temperatures rise too high, the fuel becomes a gas The third Artemis mission will see the SLS launch astronauts in Nasa's Orion spacecraft on the first ever mission to the Moon's South Pole. Without sufficient insulation, the rocket's structural integrity would be compromised \u2013 and those astronauts' lives would be at risk. Michael Alldredge is a materials engineer at Nasa. His job is to select the materials that will go into the thermal protection systems applied to the Moon rocket hardware. These will be crucial to \"maintain structural temperatures during the ascent and operation of the vehicle\", he says. He watched the launch of Artemis I in November 2022 and says it was hard to process that, after years of work, it was finally leaving the launchpad. But with Artemis II in November 2024, then Artemis III in 2025 the stakes will be much, much higher \u2013 when humans will be on board. \"Everybody's got to stay calm and cool because, you know, we're still on console, watching the rocket, watching the performance,\" he says. \"But we'll be trying to hold back the giddiness that comes with watching this mammoth vehicle just rip off the pad \u2013 all that power and thrust and force. It's breathtaking.\" Currently planned for 2025, the mission will be the first time humanity will set foot on the lunar surface in more than 50 years. Four astronauts will depart from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, sitting on top of Nasa's SLS \u2013 the only rocket powerful enough to send Orion, its crew and their supplies to the Moon in a single launch. The SLS\u00a0will have to endure extreme temperatures as it flies from the Earth, ranging from -423F (-253C) to more than 200F (93C). To cope, Nasa is advancing state-of-the-art technology for thermal protection \u2013 a spray-on foam insulation, along with other traditional insulation materials including cork \u2013 which promise to protect it from both fire and ice. Cork, although heavier than the foam, provides stronger protection. Sheets and blocks of cork will be applied to areas of the SLS that have high predicted heat loads, says Alldredge. Take the core stage engine section, where four RS-25 engines will produce almost nine million pounds (40 million newtons) of thrust during launch and ascent. Cork will be laid under the solid rocket boosters, on the fairings, and the areas where feed-lines run down the rocket to connect to other hardware. Prior to the flight, there will be one final test of the insulation \u2013 when all four RS-25 engines will be fired up, the foam and cork will be guarding the hardware \"as hot and cold collide\". \"Down at the base of the vehicle it gets very hot during ascent,\" says Alldredge. \"You've got the engines burning, and you have a lot of heat coming off the engines and the solid rocket boosters on the sides. So, we needed a material that was strong enough to deal with the heat loads at the base of the vehicle, and one that would ablate.\" During ablation, explains Alldredge, some of the material on the outside of the vehicle burns up, taking the heat with it, allowing the underlying vehicle structure to remain cool. But is sustainability top of Nasa's agenda when it comes to choosing the materials for its rockets? Not in terms of environmental impact, says Alldredge, but in the sense of reliable, long-term availability. \"Sustainability is not necessarily something that we seek from the outset,\" he says. \"We look for what materials would work. Which ones can we get? Which ones are readily available? Which will be hard or expensive to get in the future? When you've got systems as complex as we deal with, the more things you can hold constant, the better.\" The UK Space Agency (UKSA), on the other hand, says it is taking steps towards reducing its environmental impact, with plans to use recycled materials \u2013\u00a0including cork \u2013 to insulate their launcher propulsion systems. \"We are focusing on environmental as well as economical sustainability,\" says Mauro Augelli, launch systems lead and engineer at UKSA. \"It's about respect for the for the planet, and respect for the resources.\" However, he adds, natural materials \u2013 which he defines as materials with minimal processing such as cork \u2013 can be unpredictable. You might also like: \"If you don't process them very much, you can have uncertainties about the behaviour,\" he says. \"Plus, when you consider exploration or life support for astronauts, biomaterials can catch fire, they have permeability. These are not qualities you want to have, for example, if you are creating a Moon base.\" UKSA are currently assessing the lifecycles of the materials they use. The preference, he says, should go to materials with a lower environmental impact for the overall lifecycle. \"It's a trade-off between the objectives of the mission and [sustainability]. When we talk about lifecycle assessments, natural materials are better than other materials,\" he says. However, he adds, UKSA are also exploring materials such as polymers which, when recycled, can be combined with other materials for use in thermal protection. For now, however, trees are not only going to continue being important for life here on Earth, some are also destined for the stars. -- If you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

            "text": "Spaceport Cornwall says it can \"confidently look forward\" following a year that saw it facilitate the first rocket launch into space from UK soil, despite it ending in failure. Virgin Orbit's January launch failed when the rocket suffered an anomaly, but bosses say the process attracted potential partners for future launches. No launches are planned for 2024, but 2025 is a possibility. Head of engagement Ross Hulbert said it \"achieved what we needed to achieve\". A new operation facility opened in April and already has 13 tenants from the space sector, along with others on the wider site, at Cornwall Airport Newquay. \"Spaceport Cornwall's business model has always been to maximise the excitement we get from the launch activity to bring other partners in,\" Mr Hulbert said. On 9 January, Virgin Orbit launched its Start Me Up mission, carrying its launcher vehicle beneath a jumbo jet. The vehicle was successfully released and reached space, but an anomaly occurred before the satellites inside could be deployed into orbit. The plane returned to the Spaceport where a team of about 60 Virgin Orbit engineers were based, alongside Spaceport staff. In the weeks that followed, news of Virgin Orbit's financial troubles surfaced, culminating in the company shutting down in May. Mr Hulbert said: \"We woke up the next morning and we were the first licensed UK spaceport, we were fully operational and ready to work with a whole host of partners.  \"So yes, it was clearly disappointing in one sense, but we proved our capability on that pathfinder launch, and it enabled us to move on.\" New partners include Canadian company Space Engine Systems which is using a hardened aircraft hangar at the airport to test its single stage orbit space plane known as the Hello Series. \"This is much more sort of what you'd imagine when you were a kid about what a space plane is,\" Mr Hulbert said. \"It takes off from a runway, it goes and conducts its missions into space or does hypersonic travel as well.  \"And then it will return to the runway in Cornwall.\" No space launches are expected in 2024, but there is another unnamed partner expected to join in the coming weeks that has aspirations of taking off in 2025. The space cluster in Cornwall is growing, but Mr Hulbert accepts it is launching to space that really captures the imagination. \"We know that's what the public expect, and our fans expect to see from a spaceport.  \"You know it's great that we are offering all these economic opportunities, and our buildings and people are being employed here.  \"But of course, when they think of a spaceport they expect to be able to see launches going into space. So it's great that we definitely will still be able to support that activity.\" He added: \"So while Virgin themselves will not be returning here, the eyes of the space launch world have been on us, and anyone that wants to launch anything into orbit in Europe will have to do it from Spaceport Cornwall. \"We're still very much the premier choice for anyone looking at doing any sort of European mission.\" Earlier this month, the SaxaVord site in Shetland became the second UK spaceport licensee, and the first for vertical launches. Rather than any competition in a UK space race, Mr Hulbert said he was \"so so pleased for them to have reached that exciting milestone\". \"We are absolutely sharing in their success and toasting UK space excellence - it's absolutely a good thing for us to see SaxaVord doing well as well.\" Follow BBC News South West on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

            "text": "London has helped boost the increase in shoppers hitting the UK's high streets on Boxing Day, data suggests. Compared with last year, footfall was up 10% in central London and 8.8% nationally, retail analysts MRI Software said.  But when taking into account data from retail parks and shopping centres, footfall was only up 4%. Pre-Christmas events such as Black Friday mean Boxing Day sales are no longer seen as a major shopping event. Early online sales as well as major retailers such M&S, Next and John Lewis not reopening their stores until 27 December, have also had an impact on footfall. Compared with 2019, Boxing Day footfall remained 14.9% lower nationally, but was up 1.6% in central London. The footfall data was collated by MRI software using 3,600 counting points in 1,300 shopping locations across the UK. Jenni Matthews, from the company, said: \"Many people may be tightening their purse strings given the cost-of-living status, or may still be spending time with their families on Boxing Day and not be heading out to stores. \"It will be interesting to see how the rest of the week pans out for retail as we close out 2023.\" Retail group the New West End Company, which represents businesses on Oxford Street, Regent Street and Bond Street, confirmed the West End had seen a \"bumper\" Boxing Day. It added that December footfall in the area was also up 20% on November. Its chief executive Dee Corsi called the West End \"world-class\". \"More than just shopping, many flock here to enjoy all that the area has to offer across the festive season,\" she said. \"Little wonder then that we have had a busy December, rounded off with a bumper Boxing Day to set the West End up for a positive start to 2024. \"However, we cannot afford to ignore that it is international visitors driving our recovery this winter, particularly on Boxing Day. \"The cost-of-living crisis is squeezing domestic spending and dampening consumer confidence.\" Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

            "text": "Swimmers have taken a Boxing Day dip in a town lido, which is set to host more cold-water swimming sessions in 2024. Shaftesbury Town Council opened the lido for four weekends in November to December as part of a trial. Following the popularity of these sessions they will now continue every Saturday from 6 January through to March. There were three sessions on Boxing Day at the only public outdoor pool of its kind in Dorset. Town clerk, Brie Logan, said: \"We have been so blown away by the positive response to our cold-water swimming trial and are over the moon that these sessions will help the Lido to become a true community facility that is open all year round.  \"We could not have had this success without the support of our Pool Attendants, Adam and Alice, and our cold-water experts, Harriet and Lindsay.  \"They have made the experience what it is and have proved very popular with our swimmers.\" Open water swimming coach Harriet Green, who is supporting the winter trial, said there had been a \"great turnout\" on Boxing Day. She said swimmers in the area were \"trying to make it even better, more popular and create a social community around it\". Shaftesbury's outdoor pool is one of the oldest in the country, dating back to the mid-19th Century when the town's water works was built to provide a water supply for the poor. The town's first swimming club was formed in 1891, with members using the pool, carved out of solid greenstone, known as The Tank. The town council took over its running and refurbished the pool in 2016 as a \"much-treasured community asset\" offering swimming classes and private hire.

            "text": "Many of Boxing Day's front pages feature images of members of the Royal Family after they attended the Christmas Day church service in Sandringham alongside the King and Queen. The Sun's lead focuses on Sarah, Duchess of York being publicly back at the heart of the royal family as she waved to fans in Norfolk. She appeared alongside her ex-husband Prince Andrew, having not accompanied the family on a walk to the church service for more than three decades. Keeping with the Royal Family theme, the Daily Mirror focuses on King Charles delivering his second Christmas speech, in which the monarch praised the UK as a caring and compassionate country and reminded us to \"care for the Earth\". The Daily Mail also notes King Charles's message as he hails Brits who dedicate themselves to \"service\" - he also urged for peace in the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas, as well as the war in Ukraine. Elsewhere, the Times leads on a report Labour is considering plans to process claims from asylum seekers overseas. The party is said to be looking for what the paper calls \"legally watertight alternatives\" to the government's Rwanda scheme which aims to deter migrants arriving in small boats.  According to Tuesday's Daily Telegraph, the NHS is \"under fire\" for what it describes as a \"menopause drug lottery\". It says analysis of health service figures suggests women are up to three times more likely to be offered hormone replacement therapy in some areas than others. Sticking with health news, the Guardian cites government-commissioned obesity research which says in a report that children in England are at risk of a \"health timebomb\" of diabetes and heart disease. But, the government tells the paper it's delivered dramatic reductions in the amount of sugar in children's foods, such as breakfast cereals and yoghurts. Finally, the Daily Express reports on calls by some Conservatives for an urgent cut in the Bank of England's main interest rate. The Centre for Economics and Business Research suggests the current rate is stifling investment and some Tory backbenchers - including John Redwood - warn it could lead to a recession.

            "text": "Are you planning on going on a Boxing Day walk in the mountains to blow away the cobwebs after some Christmas Day indulgence? Many of us enjoy the views, the fresh air, the wildness. But during a leisurely hike earlier in the year I also enjoyed a rare weather phenomenon known as a Brocken spectre after summiting Mount Errigal. According to the Met Office, a Brocken spectre is a large shadow of an observer cast onto cloud or mist and is named after the German mountain on which is was first noted. It was spellbinding. The skies were mostly clear and the summer sun was glistening on Dunlewey Lough, at the foot of the renowned mountain in County Donegal, in the Republic of Ireland. The 751m (2,464ft) peak had delivered a breathtaking 360 degree vista. But the weather does not tend to stay the same for too long on the high ground and a cover of cloud began closing in and rising towards the back of the mountain. Heading back down the mountainside, with two young lads from Omagh, County Tyrone, who were making their first 'pilgrimage' to the majestic mountain, we were still taking in the clear views out towards the Atlantic Ocean when I glanced sideward and there it was, a Brocken spectre. I was torn. Should I take out my phone and capture it or just stare and study this gift of nature? I couldn't resist, so the phone came out. It felt other worldly as I observed what looked like my own shadow inside this circular rainbow. I was awestruck. There were clear views to the front and a Brocken spectre at the back of the mountain. It was nature delivering two very different kinds of beauty, side by side. But how does it happen? According to the Met Office, \"When an observer stands on a hill which is partially enveloped in mist and in such a position that their shadow is thrown on to the mist, they may get the illusion that the shadow is a person seen dimly through the mist. \"The illusion is that this person or spectre is gigantic and at a considerable distance away from them. \"The sun shining behind the observer projects their shadow through the mist, while the magnification of the shadow is an optical illusion which makes the shadow on nearby clouds seem at the same distance at faraway landmarks seen through the cloud.\" It further explains: \"Similarly, the shadow falls upon water droplets of varying distance which distorts perception and can make the shadow appear to move as the clouds vary and shift. \"This all combines to make the rather disorienting effect of a giant shadow moving in the distance.\" So if the mountains don't deliver the crystal clear views we hope for over the holiday season, we might just find another wonder of nature in the clouds.",

Ron Fealey, 82, was struck while crossing the street in Merthyr Tydfil on Christmas Eve 2022. His son Mike urged people not to get behind the wheel after drinking or if they had taken drugs.  Katrina Mahoney, 34, was given a five-year jail sentence after failing to stop at the scene of the crash. She admitted death by careless driving while under the influence of alcohol for killing Mr Fealey, a former nurse, who was walking home after attending a Christmas Eve church service.  Mike said his last Christmas was spent making the difficult decision to turn off his father's life support.  \"The fact that the accident happened the way that it did felt like such a waste,\" he said. \"It's just such a stupid decision to make for no good reason which ends up with all this heartache. \"Christmas normally would be something really good to look forward to, now there's that sense of dread because you know what's coming and who's not going to be there.\" The family described Ron as \"funny, intelligent and caring\".  Mike added: \"I think if anyone's making the decision to drink and drive, or take drugs and drive, it's just a no-win situation. \"For the simple sake of a decision that'll take seconds, you are possibly going to ruin your own life as well as somebody else's.\" South Wales Police urged people not to drive if they have consumed drugs or alcohol this Christmas after an increase in drink drive arrests this month.  Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said: \"Increasingly we are seeing people make the decision to take drugs or drink alcohol and drive.  \"In our last set of tests one in 20 came out as positive. That is too high. People's attitudes towards taking intoxicants and driving needs to change.\" He said roads were safer than ever before but added driving was \"one of the riskiest things people will do in their lives\"",

The Wild and Woolly event has been running at different Northamptonshire locations since the 1920s and is believed to be the oldest motorcycle scramble in the world. The club which runs the event says it is \"absolutely gutted\". Organisers hope to make a comeback in 2024, if a suitable venue can be found. Hundreds of spectators usually line the course to watch riders compete over 20 laps, facing freezing weather, deep mud and stream crossings. Some riders do not make it through the compulsory two laps of practice before the race starts. In a statement the organisers Northampton Motorcyclists Club (NMCC), said: \"It is with regret that we have to inform you all that there will be no Wild & Woolly 2023, due to our current venue at Long Buckby not being available to us this year.  \"The landowner wants the track and parking areas for the sheep throughout the winter period and we have to respect that.\" The statement goes on to say that another venue was offered, but the landowner wanted to know how many spectators would attend and the club felt it could not predict the answer. The NMCC said the possibility of running the event every two years to give the land a chance to recover was being discussed. \"We are absolutely gutted as a club to not be able to run this year,\" the club added.

            "title": "The secret sauce for Taiwan's chip superstardom",
            "text": "When 23-year-old Shih Chin-tay boarded a plane for the United States in the summer of 1969, he was flying to a different world.  He grew up in a fishing village surrounded by sugarcane fields. He had attended university in Taiwan's capital Taipei, then a city of dusty streets and grey apartment buildings where people rarely owned cars.  Now he was off to Princeton University. The US had just put a man on the Moon and the Boeing 747 in the skies. Its economy was larger than those of the Soviet Union, Japan, Germany and France combined.   \"When I landed, I was shocked,\" Dr Shih, now 77, says. \"I thought to myself: Taiwan is so poor, I must do something to try and help make it better off.\" And he did. Dr Shih and a group of young, ambitious engineers transformed an island that exported sugar and t-shirts into an electronics powerhouse.  Today's Taipei is rich and hip. High-speed trains zip passengers along the west coast of the island at 350km/h (218mph). Taipei 101 - briefly the tallest building in the world - towers over the city, an emblem of its prosperity.  Much of that is down to a tiny device no larger than a fingernail. The silicon semiconductor - wafer-thin and best-known now as a chip - sits at the heart of every technology we use, from iPhones to airplanes.  Taiwan now makes more than half the chips that power our lives. Its biggest manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), is the ninth-most valuable business in the world.  That makes Taiwan nearly irreplaceable - and vulnerable. China, fearing it could be cut off from the most advanced chips, is spending billions to steal Taiwan's crown. Or it could take the island, as it has repeatedly threatened to do.  But Taiwan's path to chip superstardom will not be easy to replicate - the island has a secret sauce, honed through decades of laborious work by its engineers. Plus, the manufacturing relies on a web of economic ties that the escalating US-China rivalry is now trying to undo. When Dr Shih arrived at Princeton, \"the US was just beginning the semiconductor revolution\", he says.  It had just been a decade since Robert Noyce made the \"monolithic integrated circuit\", packing electronic components onto a single wafer of silicon - an early version of the microchip which kickstarted the personal computer revolution. For the two years after Dr Shih graduated, he designed memory chips at Burroughs Corporation, second then to IBM in computer-making.  At the time, Taiwan was hunting for a new national industry following an oil crisis that had pummelled its exports. Silicon seemed like a possibility - and Dr Shih thought he could help: \"I thought it was time to come home.\"   In the late 1970s, he joined Taiwan's best and brightest electrical engineers at a new research lab - the staid-sounding Industrial Technology Research Institute would play an outsized role in recasting the island's economy.  Work began in Hsinchu, a small city south of Taipei - today it's a global electronics hub, dominated by TSMC's enormous fabrication plants. These chip factories, each the size of several football fields, are some of the cleanest places on earth. The finer manufacturing details are a well-guarded secret, and no outside cameras are allowed.  The newest factory - the nearly $20bn fab 18 in southern Taiwan - will soon start producing three-nanometre chips destined for next-generation iPhones.  All of this is far beyond what Dr Shih and his colleagues imagined when they opened an experimental factory in the 1970s. They were hopeful because they had technology licensed from a major US electronics maker - but to everyone's surprise, the factory outperformed its parent. It's hard to explain why and, to this day, the precise formula for Taiwan's success remains elusive.  Dr Shih's recollection is more prosaic: \"Output was better than the original RCA plant, with lower costs. So, this gave the government confidence that maybe we really could do something.\" The Taiwanese government put up the initial capital - first for the United Micro-electronics Corporation, and then in 1987 for what would become the world's biggest chip factory - TSMC.  To run it, they recruited Morris Chang, a Chinese-American engineer and former executive at US electronics giant Texas Instruments. It was a stroke of luck or genius, or both - today the 93-year-old is known as the father of Taiwan's semiconductor industry. Back then, he quickly realised that taking on US and Japanese giants at their own game was a losing proposition. Instead TSMC would only manufacture chips for others, and not design its own. This \"foundry model\", which was unheard of in 1987, changed the landscape of the industry and paved the way for Taiwan to become the pack leader.  And the timing couldn't have been better. Silicon Valley's new crop of start-ups - including Apple, Qualcomm, Nvidia - did not have the funds to build fab plants of their own. And they would struggle to find manufacturers for the chips that they couldn't function without.  \"They would have to go to leading semi-conductor companies and ask if they had any excess production capacity they could use,\" Dr Shih says. \"But then TSMC came along.\"  Now California's \"fabless\" companies could partner with Taiwan's chip makers, who had no interest in stealing their designs or competing with them.  \"Rule number one at TSMC is don't compete with your customers,\" Dr Shih says.  The world produces more than a trillion chips a year. A modern car has anywhere between 1,500 to 3,000 chips. The iPhone 12 reportedly had around 1,400 semiconductors. A shortfall in 2022, driven by soaring demand for electronics during the pandemic, hit sales of washing machines and BMWs alike.   Taiwan's extraordinary success - the island ships more than half of those trillion-plus chips, and nearly all of the most advanced ones - has been driven by its mastery of volume. In other words, Taiwanese manufacturing is incredibly efficient.  Making silicon chips is expensive and painstaking. It starts off with a large ingot of ultra-pure silicon grown from a single crystal. Each ingot may take several days to grow and could weigh up to 100kg.  After a diamond cutter slices the slab into skinny wafers, a machine uses light to etch tiny circuits onto each wafer. A single wafer may contain hundreds of microprocessors, and billions of circuits.  What matters eventually is the yield - the area of each wafer that is usable as a chip. In the 1970s US companies had yields as low as 10% and, at best, 50%.  By the 1980s the Japanese were averaging at 60%. TSMC has reportedly surpassed them all with a yield that hovers around 80%.  Over time Taiwanese manufacturers have managed to cram more and more circuits into mind-bogglingly smaller spaces. Using the latest extreme-ultraviolet light lithography machines, TSMC can etch 100 billion circuits on to a single microprocessor, or over 100 million circuits per square millimetre.  Why are Taiwanese companies so good at  this?  No-one seems to know exactly why.  Dr Shih thinks it's simple: \"We had brand new facilities, with the most up-to-date equipment. We recruited the best engineers. Even the machine operators were highly skilled. And then we didn't just import technology, we absorbed the lessons from our American teachers and applied continuous improvement.\"  A young man who spent several years working at one of Taiwan's largest electronics companies agrees: \"I think Taiwan's companies are bad at making big breakthroughs in technology. But they are very good at taking someone else's idea and making it better. This can be done by trial and error, continuously tweaking small things.\"  This is important because in a semiconductor fab the machines need to be constantly calibrated. Making microchips is engineering. But it's also more than that. Some have likened it to cooking - like a gourmet feast. Give two chefs the same recipe and ingredients - the better cook will make the better dish.   In other words, Taiwan has a secret sauce.  But the young man, who did not want to reveal his name, or that of the company, says Taiwanese companies have another advantage. \"Compared to software engineers in the US, even at the best companies here, engineers are paid quite badly,\" he said. \"But compared to other industries in Taiwan the pay is good.  So, if you work for a big electronic company after a few years, you'll be able to get a mortgage, buy a car. You'll be able to get married. So, people suck it up.\"  He described a six-day week which began each day with a meeting at 07:30 and would usually last until 19:00. He would also be called in on Sundays or holidays if there was a problem at the plant.  \"If people weren't willing to do the job the company would be finished. It's because people are willing to put up with hardship that these companies succeed.\" In December 2022 TSMC broke ground on a $40bn plant in the US state of Arizona. It was hailed by President Joe Biden as a sign that high-tech manufacturing was returning to American soil.   Since then the headlines have been somewhat less cheery.  They Wouldn't Listen To Us: Inside Arizona's Troubled Chip Plant, read one. Another said, TSMC Struggles To Recruit Workers While Facing Pushback From Unions.   Chip production was supposed to start next year. Now it's been put back to 2025.  Former TSMC chairman Dr Chang was deeply sceptical from the start. Last year he described expanding chip production in the US as an \"expensive, wasteful exercise in futility\" because manufacturing chips in the US  would be 50% more expensive than in Taiwan. But Taiwan's chip-making prowess has put it at the centre of the tech war between the US and China.  Washington wants to prevent Taiwan supplying China with the cutting-edge chips it fears Beijing will use to accelerate its weapons programs and advance its artificial intelligence.   After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which strangled Europe's gas supply, US politicians are jittery about Taiwan. They fear that the huge concentration of high-end chip production on the island makes the US economy hostage to a Chinese invasion.   But Taiwanese companies see little economic advantage in moving production off the island. They are doing so reluctantly under political pressure.  People in Taiwan resent the idea that they should be blamed for their success - and that Taiwan should voluntarily weaken what many regard as its \"silicon shield\", while the rest of the world vacillates over whether the island and its democratic society is worth protecting from Chinese aggression.  Dr Shih says those who are seeking to forcibly restructure global chip production misunderstand its success.   \"If you look at the history of semiconductors, no one country dominates this industry,\" he  says. \"Taiwan may dominate the manufacturing sector. But there is a very long supply chain and innovation from every part of it contributes to the growth of the industry. \" Much of the world's raw silicon comes from China, although most of it goes to the solar industry. Germany and Japan lead the charge in chemicals that are necessary to process the wafers.  Carl Zeiss, a German optoelectronics company better known for making eyewear and camera lenses, produces optical devices that go into the lithography machines made by a leading Dutch company, ASML. The laborious manufacturing works to designs that originate in American companies or the UK-based Arm.  Dr Shih is doubtful Beijing can recreate this supply chain - from materials to design to high-end production - inside China.  \"If they want to create a different model then I wish them luck,\" he says with a shrug. \"Because if you really want innovation, you need everyone to work together from all around the world. It's not one company or one country.\" He is just as doubtful about cutting China out as the US has been doing.  \"I think that's probably a major mistake,\" he says. \"When I look back, I feel lucky to have witnessed the extraordinary growth of Taiwan's economy and this long period of peace. Now I see conflict in other parts of the world, and I worry it may come to Asia.  \"I hope people appreciate the precious effort that we made and won't destroy it.\"",

            "title": "Lockerbie bombing: The ultimate detective story?",
            "text": "Thirty-five years ago this week the deadliest terror attack in British history took place when Pan Am flight 103 from London to New York exploded over the Scottish town of Lockerbie. In a prison cell in the United States, 72-year-old Abu Agila Masud is waiting to stand trial, accused of making the bomb that destroyed the US airliner. The prospect of the Libyan's trial has been accompanied by a renewed surge of interest in the events of 21 December 1988. At its heart lies an atrocity which killed 270 men, women and children from 21 countries. Entire families died on the plane and on the ground. An account of the investigation that followed reads like the ultimate true crime detective story.  Everyone on board Pan Am flight 103 that night was killed - 259 passengers and crew. The oldest was 82 while the youngest was a two-month-old baby. Two thirds of the victims were Americans. It was the worst terror attack on the US until 9/11. Another 11 people perished when the wreckage fell on their homes in Lockerbie. In total, 44 UK citizens were killed. It remains the worst act of mass murder in British legal history. There will always be competing theories about who was responsible but only one version of events has been accepted by a court of law and upheld on appeal. In 2001, a Scottish court sitting in the neutral Netherlands ruled it was an act of state-sponsored terrorism carried out by the Libyan intelligence service. Three judges decided Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was part of the plot and convicted him of playing a central role in the bombing. He became known as \"the Lockerbie bomber\" but he was always accused of acting along with other Libyan conspirators, including Abu Agila Masud, the man now facing trial in the US. The case put before that court more than 20 years ago followed an international investigation that extended to 70 countries. Almost every piece of key evidence has been debated and disputed, to the exasperation of the Scots and Americans who investigated Lockerbie. Responding to accusations that Libya and Megrahi were framed, a former chief constable of Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary once declared: \"You couldn't make this up. How on earth can you set up a chain of evidence like that? It's nonsense.\" The story of that chain of evidence starts in the streets of Lockerbie and the surrounding countryside. The Boeing 747 Clipper Maid of the Seas broke up at 31,000 feet as it flew from Heathrow to New York, four days before Christmas. Approximately 319 tons of wreckage were scattered over 845 square miles - the largest crime scene in history.  A town that would normally have four police officers on duty found itself at the centre of a massive recovery operation and investigation. By the morning of 22 December, about 1,100 police officers were involved, along with 1,000 personnel from the military, emergency services, local authorities and voluntary groups. In the weeks that followed, a painstaking search recovered wreckage as far away as the coast of Northumberland on the other side of the country. Investigators found signs of an explosion on one of the baggage containers from the forward hold. Scottish police and FBI agents established the bomb had been concealed in a Toshiba radio cassette player in a Samsonsite suitcase. Initially, suspicion fell on Iran and a Syrian-backed Palestinian militant group. On 3 July 1988, a US Navy cruiser USS Vincennes had mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner over the Gulf, killing all 290 men, women and children on board. Iran swore revenge. Three months before the Lockerbie bombing, in an operation titled Autumn Leaves, West German police had raided flats in Frankfurt and arrested members of the Syrian-backed Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC). The group had been preparing bombs in radio cassette players. By December 1988, most had been released. The feeder flight for Pan Am 103, Pan Am 103a, had left from Frankfurt. Months were spent investigating the PFLP-GC group but the search for evidence then took the inquiry in a different direction - to an island in the Mediterranean. A babygro from the suitcase containing the bomb had been made in Malta. Another charred fragment from a pair of trousers bore a Yorkie label. With the input of the FBI, the inquiry traced the Yorkie brand to a Maltese clothes manufacturer. Scottish detectives visited the firm and were told Yorkie trousers had been sold to a small shop in a side street in Sliema. The officers listened in astonishment when the owner of Mary's House recalled selling Yorkie trousers to a man in the weeks before the Lockerbie bombing. It was an unusually lucrative piece of business Tony Gauci remembered well, even though it had happened nine months before. He said the customer had bought a seemingly random collection of clothes and an umbrella. Mr Gauci was certain he was Libyan and in February 1991, shown a photograph of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi supplied by the Czech intelligence service, he said it looked similar to the man who'd come into his shop. His identification of Megrahi was never absolute but records showed the Libyan was on Malta on the date Mr Gauci was alleged to have sold him the clothes. All of this was vigorously disputed at Megrahi's trial and has been ever since, but to this day that cornerstone of the prosecution case remains in place. In January 1989, detectives searching near the countryside 30 miles from Lockerbie had found another scrap of cloth. Embedded in the charred neckband of a shirt was a fragment of a green-coloured circuit board. With the help of the CIA, the FBI matched it to MST-13 bomb timers which had been seized in the African country of Togo. Then with the assistance of German police and the authorities in Switzerland, the trail led to a company called Mebo. The first interviews with the company revealed it had sold MST-13 timers to Libya. One of its owners, Edwin Bollier, knew Megrahi, who had an office next to his in Zurich. Back in Malta, an exhaustive search of immigration records established Megrahi had arrived on the island from Libya on 20 December 1988, the day before the bombing, using a false passport supplied by the Libyan intelligence service.  He travelled back to Libya on the 21st, accompanied, it was alleged, by the suspect now in that American jail - Abu Agila Masud. In November 1991, Scottish and American prosecutors announced charges which alleged that Megrahi and another Libyan, Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, were members of their country's intelligence service. Megrahi had been head of security at Libyan Arab Airlines. Fhimah was the former station manager for Libyan Arab Airlines at Luqa Airport on Malta. They were accused of placing the suitcase containing the bomb into the luggage system at Luqa for a flight from Malta to Frankfurt. Computer records printed off by a baggage handler at Frankfurt Airport after the bombing showed an unaccompanied suitcase had arrived on a flight from Malta and was loaded onto the feeder flight, Pan Am 103a.  The prosecution case was that it was transferred onto board Pan Am 103 at Heathrow. Interviewed in Libya, Megrahi and Fhimah protested their innocence. Megrahi said he hadn't been in Malta on the day of the bombing but the fake passport proved otherwise. Libya's leader Colonel Gaddafi refused to hand the men over. Years of deadlock and sanctions followed, until the involvement of Nelson Mandela and a UN-brokered deal led to a trial in a Scottish court at Camp Zeist, a former US airbase in the Netherlands. After 84 days of evidence, Fhimah was cleared. Megrahi was convicted of mass murder, lost his first appeal and was flown to Scotland to serve a life sentence. Many relatives of the American victims were furious that Colonel Gaddafi had not been in the dock with the pair. But some relatives of the British victims, led by the English GP Dr Jim Swire, believed and still believe that Megrahi was innocent, and the real culprits were Iran and the Palestinians. In 2003, lawyers acting for the victims announced they had reached agreement with Libya over a \u00a31.7bn compensation fund.  Libya accepted responsibility for the actions of its officials, although years later Colonel Gaddafi's son claimed it had only done so for sanctions to be lifted. In 2007, the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission referred the case back to the appeal court. It said it had found nothing to suggest evidence had been tampered with - a longstanding accusation from Megrahi's supporters - but believed he might have been the victim of a miscarriage of justice, principally over Tony Gauci's identification of him as the man who bought the clothes for the suitcase that held the bomb. The case was slowly working its way through the courts when Megrahi was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2008. He abandoned his second appeal in 2009 and was released on compassionate grounds by the Scottish government after doctors advised he had three months to live. The decision was supported by Dr Swire and some of the other British relatives, but it is still the cause of great bitterness among many relatives of the American victims. Megrahi outlived Colonel Gaddafi, who was killed after an uprising toppled his regime in 2011. The man called the Lockerbie bomber died in 2012, three years after his release. Gaddafi's demise gave investigators fresh hope that new light could be shed on Lockerbie. Contact was made with the new Libyan authorities and Scottish and American investigators and prosecutors travelled to North Africa to meet them. In 2015, Scotland's Crown Office and the US Attorney General announced they had evidence to treat two Libyans as suspects and were requesting permission from Libya to interview them. The suspects were Abu Agila Masud and Gaddafi's former intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi, who had picked up Megrahi at the airport in Tripoli when he arrived home from Scotland six years before. What appeared to be a major development was derailed when Libya descended into civil war but lines of communication with Libyan officials were maintained despite the bloodshed and chaos. In 2017, five years after his death, Megrahi's family lodged a new bid to clear his name. It was being considered when Scotland's national police force announced the results of Operation Sandwood - an investigation into allegations from Megrahi's supporters. Police Scotland said they had found no evidence of criminality in relation to the handling of the investigation and prosecution of the case. What they had found was new information which they passed to the Crown Office and the Scottish Criminal Case Review Commission which was looking at the case a second time. In 2020, the commission sent Megrahi's conviction back to the appeal court, having concluded that: \"No reasonable trial court, relying on the evidence led at trial, could have held the case against Mr Megrahi was proved beyond reasonable doubt.\" As ever with Lockerbie, it wasn't that simple. The commission also said it had obtained new information which, if believed, pointed at Libya and Megrahi as being responsible for bombing Pan Am 103. On the 32nd anniversary of the bombing, the US announced charges against Abu Agila Masud, who was serving a jail sentence in Libya for targeting anti-Gaddafi forces back in 2011. The FBI criminal complaint said Masud had confessed to making the bomb that brought down Pan Am 103, and had acted in concert with Megrahi and Fhimah, the Libyan cleared at Camp Zeist. The Americans alleged Masud was an ex-Libyan intelligence operative and had admitted carrying out the attack on the orders of Colonel Gaddafi, who, he said, congratulated him afterwards. Masud was also said to have admitted making the bomb used in an attack on a disco in Berlin in 1986. American and Scottish investigators believe that was the incident that triggered the whole terrible cycle of retribution and revenge that led to Lockerbie. Libya and the US were at loggerheads in the 1970s and 80s. The bombing at the La Belle disco killed two US servicemen and a Turkish woman, and injured another 229 people, 79 of them American. The then US president Ronald Reagan said Libya was responsible and 10 days later, the US air force bombed the Libyan capital Tripoli and the city of Benghazi. Widely seen as an attempt to assassinate Colonel Gaddafi, who survived, the operation killed his adopted baby daughter along with at least 15 civilians. The bombing of Libya after the bombing of the disco has been put forward as the motive for the bombing of Pan Am 103. Another theory is that Libya took on the \"task\" of avenging the shooting down of the Iranian airliner after the Palestinian cell was discovered in West Germany. A month after the charges against Masud had been made public, Scottish judges rejected Megrahi's posthumous appeal and upheld the verdict delivered at Camp Zeist 20 years earlier.  In December 2022, a few weeks before the 34th anniversary of the bombing, came the news that Masud had been handed over to American custody. The exact circumstances have not yet been explained but the head of Scotland's prosecution service has said the process was lawful. Masud's family claimed he had been dragged from his sick bed by armed militia and was a religious man who wouldn't kill anyone. Named in court papers as Abu Agila Mohammad Mas'ud Kheir Al-Marimi, the Libyan has pled not guilty to two counts of destruction of an aircraft resulting in death and a count of destruction of a vehicle resulting in death.  Assuming his trial goes ahead, the case built by Scottish and American investigators over decades will be put before a jury in a US federal court. The provenance of the alleged confession is sure to be contested by the defence. Will the trial happen? Masud is a long way from home and facing the possibility of ending his days in a foreign jail. If he does know what happened at Lockerbie, would it be in his interests to co-operate with the US authorities? As for Gaddafi's former spy chief, Abdullah Senussi, he's still alive in Libya. The prospect of him ever standing trial over Lockerbie seems far-fetched, but this case has a long history of unexpected twists and turns. Thirty-five years on, there are more chapters in this story to come.",

            "text": "British teen Alex Batty is due back in the UK in the next few days, after he was found in France having been missing for six years, police said.  The 17-year-old vanished in 2017 on a holiday in Spain with his mother and grandfather. His family in the UK is \"massively relieved\" and going through a \"whole host of emotions\", Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said.  Its priority was his safe return to the UK, the force said. He was found on Wednesday morning by a motorist close to Toulouse in the south of France.  Chris Sykes, assistance chief constable of GMP, said the force was \"relieved and overjoyed\" to receive the news that Alex is safe and well.  \"This is a huge moment for Alex, for his family and for the community in Oldham,\" he said in a press conference.  \"The young man and Alex's grandmother spoke on a video call last night and whilst she is content that this is indeed Alex, we obviously have further checks to do when he returns to the United Kingdom,\" he said.  He added that the force's main priority is now to see Alex return home.  \"We still have some work to do in establishing the full circumstances surrounding his disappearance and where he has been in all those years,\" he said.  He added that Alex's mother - who does not have parental guardianship of him - is \"part of\" the investigation. Her whereabouts are unknown. A police source earlier told BBC News the boy had been taken to a police station by a concerned motorist who had spotted him on a road in the foothills of the Pyrenees early on Wednesday morning. \"He explained that he had been walking for four days, that he set off from a place in the mountains, though he didn't say where,\" delivery driver Fabien Accidini said. \"I typed his name into the internet and saw that he was being looked for,\" he said. Mr Accidini told local media the teenager's plan had been to find a big city with an embassy to ask for assistance. Instead, Mr Accidini contacted French authorities for help. He added that they talked for more than three hours, in which Alex told him his story. The delivery driver said he lent the teenager his phone and let him use his Facebook account to contact his grandmother, Susan Caruana, who is also his legal guardian. His first words to his grandmother for six years were: \"Hello Grandma, it's me Alex. I'm in France Toulouse. I really hope that you receive this message. I love you, I want to come home.\" It is understood that Alex had been living in the remote Pyrenean valleys, travelling about from place to place in a kind of itinerant commune. The area in the foothills of the Pyrenees is known for attracting people in search of alternative lifestyles. Alex, from Oldham in Greater Manchester, will not say where his mother is or exactly where he had been living in the Pyrenees, the prosecutor's office told the BBC. Ms Caruana told the BBC in 2018 that she believed Alex's mother Melanie Batty and grandfather David Batty had taken him to live with a spiritual community in Morocco.  She said at the time they were seeking an alternative lifestyle and did not want Alex to go to school. Melanie and David Batty left Greater Manchester with Alex for a pre-agreed week-long holiday to Marbella in Spain on 30 September 2017. He was last seen at the Port of Malaga on 8 October that year, the day they were expected to return to the UK. British police were contacted via the UK embassy in Paris. In a statement, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said: \"We are supporting a British national in France and are in contact with local authorities.\" Additional reporting by Chris Bockman in Toulouse",

An Ofsted inspection \"contributed\" to the death of head teacher Ruth Perry, an inquest has ruled. The inspection at Caversham Primary School in Reading \"lacked fairness, respect and sensitivity\", senior coroner Heidi Connor said. Mrs Perry, 53, took her own life in January while waiting for the report to be published. A local radio presenter has hosted his final show for BBC Radio Berkshire. Andrew Peach's breakfast show has been a feature on the station's airwaves since 2005. He said he was \"touched and humbled that so many people got in touch to say goodbye\". Specialist bleed control kits designed to save stabbing victims have been placed in businesses throughout a town. The packs in seven locations in Slough contain dressings, scissors, gloves, tourniquets and a chest wound sealant. The kits are designed to prevent catastrophic blood loss from an injury while waiting for an ambulance. Several large sites, including office buildings and a hotel, could be converted to provide thousands of new homes in Reading.  Reading Borough Council issued a call for sites to be suggested earlier in the year, as part of its Local Plan update.  A number of the sites have been considered by the council as acceptable places for new homes. A plane carrying up to 242 passengers came \"very close\" to colliding with a drone, its pilot has said.

UKAB concluded \"the reported altitude and/or description of the object were sufficient to indicate that it could have been a drone\". It considered the risk of collision as A, the highest category.

Malmesbury Amateur Boxing Club started after head coach Mike Rees saw the classes proving popular in America. One of its biggest fans is Billy Parry who found out he had the progressive neurological condition seven years ago. He said the classes have helped strengthen his muscles: \"You've got to get out and you've got to fight it.\" \"I've got worse and worse and the last two years have really gone downhill, \" he told BBC Radio Wiltshire. \"It's a progressive disease and gradually it takes you down.  \"I can feel I've deteriorated a lot now. I'm doing my best to pull myself back up or at least be stable.\" Mike Rees is head coach at the club and is keen to roll out even more classes for those grappling with the condition. \"I started off with maybe two in the first session and now 10 are signed up to it,\" he said. \"They must enjoy it - they keep coming back.\" Mr Rees said that boxing is especially good for Parkinson's \"because it involves all body movement, focus and concentration, which is good for the mind as well\". Parkinson's is a progressive condition that worsens over time. Those with the disease have too little of the chemical dopamine in their brain because some of the nerve cells that make it have stopped working. Symptoms include: Source: Parkinson's UK David Lewis was also diagnosed seven years ago and said exercise was a big help for him. \"It's so much better than medication and you don't get the side effects. \"It's really maintenance. Keeping everything moving and rebuilding the neuron paths in the brain.\" Meanwhile Bob Cazenove - who was diagnosed in 2015 - said boxing is \"great because you're working the whole body\" but it is also \"great to get your anger out\". Andy heard about the group through the local branch of Parkinson's UK and explained: \"It's good for my Parkinson's, it helps my co-ordination.\" Harriet Mallinson fundraises for them and calls it a \"small and mighty club - it's got a lot of reach in terms of local towns and villages surrounding it\". \"We'd love to be able to provide it to more people and get the word out.\" Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

            "text": "The UK's only giant pandas have set off for China after leaving Edinburgh Zoo. Tian Tian and Yang Guang departed the capital's airport for Chengdu at about 13:40 on Monday. The animals were loaded aboard a Boeing 777 China Southern cargo plane in specially-built crates for the 13-hour flight. It brings their 12-year loan to Scotland to an end after a breeding programme failed to produce a cub. Royal Zoological Society Scotland (RZSS) chief executive David Field said it was a sad day for staff and visitors alike. He said: \"They were all feeling that emotion as they were literally waving them goodbye this morning. \"It's hard. These animals have been huge parts of their lives for the last 12 years. \"It's sad not just for our keepers, but our members, our visitors and all those people who have watched them on pandacam.\" The pair jetted off alongside a keeper from Edinburgh Zoo, an RZSS vet and a Chinese representative. Two bespoke metal boxes, with sliding padlock doors, pee trays and removable screens - so keepers can check on them during the flight - were built by the zoo's blacksmith to transport the animals. A paperwork issue briefly delayed their boarding on the tarmac before the crates were hoisted onto the aircraft. A supply of bamboo was also loaded onboard to keep them fed during the long journey. The pandas have been in isolation in Scotland since the start of November in a bid to lessen the risk of catching any diseases. It is expected the animals will be quarantined for a brief period in China before being introduced to their new home in Sichuan province. The pair have been in Scotland since December 2011. Their loan was extended for an additional two years to make up for the zoo's closure during the Covid pandemic. Conservationists had hoped female panda Tian Tian and male Yang Guang would breed while in Scotland. However, the animals were unable to conceive despite several attempts. The zoo and veterinarians from China made eight unsuccessful attempts at artificial insemination between the pair. The last attempt was in 2021, after which the giant panda breeding programme was stopped.",

            "title": "Nikki Haley under attack and more Republican debate takeaways",
            "text": "The fourth Republican debate featured a much-diminished field, but the night fell into a familiar pattern: rivals firing attacks at an ascendant candidate, a longshot candidate grasping at insults, and a palpable absence of the actual frontrunner, Donald Trump. Polling shows the former president remains far ahead of any of the candidates onstage despite skipping each debate. His political action committee did not mince words and called the event a \"race for second place\". The debate took on new urgency as the candidates - former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, former New Jersey Gov Chris Christie, Florida Gov Ron DeSantis, and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy - only have mere weeks to cobble together support before the first contest in Iowa.  Each candidate used their precious time on the debate stage differently.  Mr Christie pressed his colleagues to denounce Mr Trump, Ms Haley flaunted her foreign policy credentials, Mr DeSantis emphasised his culture war success in Florida and Mr Ramaswamy embraced conspiracy. At several points, personal insults flew between the candidates.  Here are the most important takeaways from Wednesday's debate. As in each previous debate, the candidates all had a primary target. Tonight's was Nikki Haley. The former South Carolina governor and UN Ambassador has seen a surge in momentum, though she still places third in most polls and trails far behind Mr Trump.   But her recent success earned more than a few pointed attacks.  Mr DeSantis accused her of changing her position on transgender youth treatment, which he opposes. Mr Ramaswamy attacked her for joining the Boeing board of directors after departing government service. He further claimed she backed progressive business principles that have faced conservative criticism. \"You are corrupt,\" he declared bluntly. Ms Haley appeared unfazed.  \"I love all the attention fellas, thank you for that,\" she quipped.  In her closing pitch, Ms Haley cited polls to emphasise she was the only candidate in the race who could beat Joe Biden in the general election. Mr Christie appeared to find his greatest success on the debate stage in his return to his faithful role as an attack dog focused squarely on Mr Trump.  He seized on the former president's recent quip that he would only be dictator for \"day one\" of his presidency. The former New Jersey governor warned Republicans and said Mr Trump was a \"dictator\" and \"bully\" focused entirely on exacting retribution. Mr Christie also shared his disappointment that his fellow candidates have shied away from harshly criticising Mr Trump. Their silence makes \"it seem like his conduct is acceptable\", he said.  The only other candidate who criticised Mr Trump on stage was Mr DeSantis, who was pushed by the debate moderators to speak on the topic. The governor, who is 45, argued Mr Trump, 77,  was too old to serve as president and had not fulfilled his key 2016 campaign promises on immigration. \"I think we need to have somebody younger. I think when you get up to 80, I don't think it's a job for that,\" Mr DeSantis said. Mr Ramaswamy promised reporters he would bring his \"brutally frank\" candour to the final debate. Most did not anticipate that meant he would fully embrace conspiracy theories and fling even more insults on live television.  Mr Ramaswamy ticked off a laundry list of conspiracies in an apparent bid at chumming the waters for far-right voters. He applauded himself for being the only one at the debate willing to say that the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol was an inside job. He then claimed that the American government lied about 9/11 and that the 2020 election was stolen by the tech industry.   The American pharmaceutical entrepreneur also endorsed the great replacement theory, a racist conspiracy theory that claims there is a secret plan to replace white people in Europe and the US through mass migration. Civil rights groups say the theory promotes white supremacy.  Mr Ramaswamy has not feared courting controversy or lashing out at his fellow candidates, which in turn has earned their ire in past debates.   This time he accused Ms Haley of corruption and Mr Christie of being a fascist.  Mr Christie responded by calling Mr Ramaswamy the \"most obnoxious blowhard in America\" and telling him to \"shut up for a little while\".  After calling the entrepreneur \"scum\" at the last debate, Ms Haley took a different approach. When given the chance to respond to Mr Ramaswamy, Ms Haley said his attack \"was not worth my time to respond to\". ",

            "text": "The monster movie is taking the US by storm, with stellar reviews and box office, after reportedly being made for a mere $15m. Does it show where Hollywood is going wrong, asks Caryn James. Godzilla, the lumbering father of future action movies, has been a staple of cinema for nearly 70 years, the giant lizard stomping on cities around the world and tangling with other monsters in dozens of spinoffs. The new, Japanese-made Godzilla Minus One is being acclaimed as among the best ever, and it is that rare thing, both a critical and box office success. That may be a lesson for Hollywood. Reportedly made for a mere $15m, with a simple plot and a surprisingly complicated, humane hero, its back-to-basics approach has made the film a hit at the very moment that bloated Hollywood superhero franchises are flailing. More like this:  \u2013 Why Japan loves monster movies  \u2013 10 of the best films to watch in December  \u2013 Are we in the era of the 'flopbuster'? Written, directed and with visual effects by the veteran Japanese director Takashi Yamazaki, Godzilla opened in wide release in the US on 1 December and made $11m over its opening weekend, ranking number three behind Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance and the latest Hunger Games instalment. That may not sound like a blockbuster number, but it's huge for a subtitled film. Exhibitor Relations, a company tracking box office receipts, wrote on X (formerly Twitter) \"Godzilla Minus One delivered a mighty box office blow\". Worldwide the film has already more than doubled its budget, having made $23m in Japan, with the release in the UK and Ireland still to come, on 15 December. As Godzilla movies go, it is a terrific mix of action and character. Few monster movies, or action blockbusters in general, have received similar acclaim, with a score of 96% from critics and 98% from audiences on Rotten Tomatoes. In a review that reflects the consensus, the Daily Beast praised the way it balanced its \"human-and-titan-sized concerns\", calling it \"just about everything fans could want\". The story begins at the end of World War Two when kamikaze pilot K\u014dichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) realises that Japan is about to lose the war and refuses to kill himself, instead landing his plane on an island where aircraft are repaired. That's one of Yamazaki's shrewdest choices: K\u014dichi's decision to live makes him sympathetic to a contemporary audience, but he himself feels like a coward. When Godzilla attacks the island, and K\u014dichi freezes rather than launching a missile at him, almost everyone else on the island dies, and he carries a double burden of guilt through the next few years \u2013 when Godzilla re-emerges and attacks mainland Japan itself. Yamazaki's sophisticated characterisation fits easily into the immersive action. The CGI Godzilla often comes directly at the camera, staring at us with a giant open jaw and devilish yellow eyes. Radioactive, it shoots icy-blue rays out of the spikes on its back as it chases terrified crowds through the streets of Tokyo. The effects don't go much beyond that and a few explosions. Yamazaki's visuals can't compete with Hollywood-budgeted action, and he doesn't try to. A cinematic sea change  Why should he, when those budgets are clearly not enough to make a movie work? Box office returns for November's The Marvels, the most recent release in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, were the lowest in the franchise's history. In August, Blue Beetle, the latest in the DC franchise, which includes Superman and the upcoming Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, was that franchise's lowest opening ever. The Hollywood Reporter said that Marvel is now \"taking stock\" of its future. DC is rebooting its franchise with Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn as the studio's co-chairman. Even considering the reboots,\u00a0it's not clear that Hollywood producers know what critics and audiences find easy to spot. As the franchises have expanded, the action has overwhelmed the cartoonish characters, and the stories are so overwrought you need a Wikipedia refresher to understand them. The problem goes beyond what is now commonly called superhero fatigue. Which timeline is Thor in now, pre- or post- Snap? Huh? As Owen Gleiberman put it in his Variety review of The Marvels, watching the movies and television spinoffs has become \"a bit of an ordeal\" as they are \"loaded down with MCU baggage\". The success of Godzilla Minus One tells us that action-movie viewers want entertainment, not homework. Hollywood has its own often rocky relation to Godzilla, of course. The 1998 Godzilla with Matthew Broderick was so derided it stands at a pathetic 20% on Rotten Tomatoes. The current Monsterverse franchise, which puts Godzilla and King Kong in the same movies, has done better with critics and audiences. The fourth instalment, Godzilla vs Kong (2021), is considered the best, and was a commercial hit even considering the way that Covid limited the box office. But that franchise is starting to echo Marvel's overwrought more-is-more approach. In its current Monsterverse television series on Apple TV+, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, John Goodman plays the same character he did in 2017's Kong: Skull Island, and who even remembers that? Godzilla Minus One doesn't even have non-stop action. What's there is big and suitably monstrous, with Godzilla swinging trains and cars in his mouth in homage to the original 1954 movie. But K\u014dichi's burden of guilt drives this film. In the rubble of his Tokyo neighbourhood, he takes in a young woman and an orphaned little girl she has saved, but refuses to admit that he loves this makeshift family. There is melodrama here, but there is also reality underneath it all. Yamazaki recently told Vulture that he deliberately simplified the plot, avoiding any monster-on-monster battles, a la Godzilla vs Kong. \"The kaiju [monsters] can battle, but the human story needs to be there,\" he said. Hollywood isn't exactly known for its human heart, but (no offense, Loki, Thor and pals) the studios might want to pay attention to this reanimated Godzilla.

            "title": "Zero carbon flight 'as big a challenge as Concorde'",
            "text": "The woman who runs Airbus's base near Bristol has described the challenge of taking carbon emissions out of aviation as \"similar to building Concorde\". Sue Partridge runs the Wing of Tomorrow programme for the European aerospace giant.  Her team is designing wings to fly on hydrogen, with near zero emissions. She has been at the aircraft factory, based in Filton, in the north of the city, for 34 years, but says this is \"the biggest challenge\" she has seen. Concorde was designed and built in Filton, in collaboration with French engineers. Sue Partridge said she was \"very proud\" of her site's heritage. \"When I started all the older engineers had all worked on Concorde, and they used to talk about 'when I worked on Concorde'.\" Today, that generation has retired. It is 20 years since Concorde 216 made its last flight, landing on the Filton runway on 26 November 2003. The new generation of engineers have a new challenge, Ms Partridge explained. \"This challenge we have to decarbonise aviation, to make aviation stop impacting our planet, is a similar size challenge to Concorde.\" The supersonic aircraft was famously thirsty.  Concorde burned 20 tonnes of jet fuel an hour, nearly four times as much as a modern Airbus A350. And because she could only carry 100 passengers, the luxury jet consumed 17 litres to carry one passenger each 62 miles (100km). A modern Airbus will use just 2.9 litres by comparison. Even by the standards of her times, Concorde used a lot of fuel. It was generally acknowledged the cost of flying supersonic to New York was about three times the fuel consumption of a Boeing 747. Today's Airbus jets owe much of their fuel efficiency to the wing designers of Filton. \"Many people don't realise how important wing design is to saving fuel,\" Ms Partridge explained. \"Our latest aircraft, the A321 XLR, will be 30% more efficient than the aircraft it replaces.\" But even efficient aircraft still use kerosene, still produce carbon dioxide and still contribute to climate change. So now the engineers in the factory that broke the sound barrier are trying to create aircraft with \"near zero\" emissions. Most will run on hydrogen, either burned directly or used in fuel cells to generate electricity on board. The engineering challenges are huge. \"You're talking about storing cryogenic hydrogen on the aircraft at minus 250 centigrade,\" Ms Partridge told me. \"Managing that hydrogen, and burning it or using a fuel cell to fly without using any kerosene-based fuel whatsoever.\" Airbus expects to have these aircraft in the skies \"in the mid 2030s\".  Aviation's critics are sceptical.  Cait Hewitt, policy director of the Aviation Environment Federation, has analysed the government's own policy documents, called \"Jet Zero\". \"Hydrogen planes are unlikely to be on long haul routes,\" she said. \"They're unlikely to be at a big scale. The government's forecast is that the introduction of zero emission aircraft might cut emissions from the aviation sector by 4% by 2050.\" The problem is that every airport in the world will have to install new fuel tanks for compressed hydrogen, all at 250 degrees below zero. Hydrogen will have to be made on a huge scale, near to the airports that use it, with renewable electricity. And politicians, regulators and passengers will all need persuading that the new planes are safe, and genuinely low-emission. Compared to this, breaking the sound barrier is starting to look simple.

            "text": "A Boeing 747 cargo jet has been forced to turn around, after a horse escaped from its stall and caused chaos as the plane cruised at 30,000ft (9,144m). The plane was headed to Belgium from New York but did a U-turn roughly 90 minutes after its departure when the animal got loose.  Air traffic control audio recorded the pilot saying: \"We have a live animal, a horse, on board the airplane. The horse managed to escape.\"   \"We cannot get the horse back secured.\"  The pilot flying Air Atlanta Icelandic flight 4592 told air traffic control the plane was fine but that the horse on the loose was the concern. He then requested a veterinarian meet the aircraft once it landed back at John F Kennedy International Airport. As the plane made its way back during the incident last Thursday, the pilot said he needed to dump 20 tonnes of fuel, \"east of Nantucket\", a popular enclave for the rich near Massachusetts.  The plane had to dump the fuel due to the plane's weight.  It remains unclear how the horse Houdini-ed its way out, but it was unrestrained when the plane landed at the airport. \"Do you require assistance?\" air traffic control asked the pilot after the plane arrived.  \"On the ground, negative\" the pilot replied. \"On the ramp, yes. We have a horse in problem, in difficulty.\"  The flight took off later in the same day and successfully arrived at Liege Airport on Friday morning, according to FlightRadar24. Air Atlanta Icelandic did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. Why the horse was being transported also remains unknown. One of the more common reasons is the transportation of race horses, according to experts. \"You have a first class, a business class, and the economy,\" one source told CNN, referring to the different size container options available for the animals. This latest incident was not the first time an animal escaped its cargo stall while onboard an airplane. In August, a bear freed itself from its crate on an Iraqi Airways flight headed from Dubai to Baghdad, the Associated Press reported.",

            "text": "A landlord of a 700-year-old pub has said he may be forced to close the site down if its licence is changed. Tewkesbury Council is holding a licence review after noise complaints were made about The Black Bear, which reopened in July after a seven-year renovation.  Landlord Luke Haynes, 29 said cutting the pub's ability to the play live music would make it \"commercially unviable\". The council said checks carried out found noise levels \"unacceptable\". The Black Bear, on Tewkesbury High Street, dates back to 1308 and is thought to be the oldest pub in Gloucestershire. Within a month of reopening the pub had noise complaints and on 19 October Tewkesbury Borough Council said a review of its licence is being sought on the grounds the pub is \"undermining\" its licence on public nuisance grounds.  Already a Change.Org petition supporting the pub has been signed by more than 2,500 people.  The petition says: \"We urge those reviewing its licence to consider not just legal factors but also the broader impact on our community if this vital institution were forced to close down.\" Supporters of the business say it has \"rejuvenated\" Tewkesbury and is a \"fantastic pub\". Mr Haynes, who started renovating the site in 2017, said he was expecting a certain level of issue because reopening was a \"big change\". He said: \"When you have got a very busy, vibrant pub, that's 700 years old, you know occasionally there are going to be some noise complaints and it sort of comes with the territory of somewhere like this, especially after it's been shut for so long.  \"It has been quiet here for so long and now we've reopened, and it's been busy - that is obviously a big change for people.\" The pub's current licence allows it to play music outside for 365 days of the year but following the complaints, the council is suggesting reducing that to six days. Mr Hayes said he does not want to play live music everyday, but having the option in the summer months was important for the Black Bear's trade.  \"When we took ownership of the pub we drew out the plans based on what the licence allowed us to be able to do, and we tried to do it to secure the future of the pub,\" he said. \"Six days is the equivalent of two weekends for us and they [the council] also want a two-week notice which makes it really difficult to forecast and it makes it commercially unviable to be able to sustain that business. \"It feels extreme and unworkable,\" he added.  He also said \"a lot of investment\" had gone into bringing the pub \"back to its former glory\", and that he had contracted sound engineers to look at ways of reducing noise levels. Tewkesbury Borough Council's lead member for clean and green environment, Councillor Sarah Hands, said  complaints had been received about indoor and outdoor noise.  Ms Hands said: \"Since the Black Bear reopened earlier this year, we have received complaints from residents living close by regarding noise levels from music both inside the premises and in the garden, and from patrons using the outside seating area. \"Our Environmental Health team carried out monitoring of the music sound levels and found them to be unacceptable.  \"We provided the venue with support and advice on licensing conditions and the use of the garden, but unfortunately we have continued to receive complaints. \"By applying for a review of the premises' license, we are seeking to ensure the best outcome for residents and the operation of the business.\" Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

            "text": "A deal to settle a dispute between the UK and the United States over support for aircraft makers will mean \"more jobs and opportunities in Wales\", the international trade secretary has said. On a visit to Flintshire, Liz Truss said the truce would bring more business to the Airbus Broughton site. Welsh producers had \"a lot to gain\" from global trade deals, she added. But farming unions are concerned a deal with Australia could make Welsh lamb less competitive. The agreement with the US to suspend retaliatory tariffs on a range of goods ends a 17-year trade row over subsidies for Airbus and Boeing. Airbus employs 5,000 people at the Broughton site. Visiting the factory on Friday, Ms Truss said ending the \"tit-for-tat trade war\" was in everybody's interests. \"It means more jobs and opportunities here in Wales - high-quality jobs and future growth for the industry, and we've just had the good news that 70 more aircraft have been ordered,\" she said. \"That will bring more business into this factory and of course that's because there's no longer those tariffs being charged on those wings.\" Ms Truss was also asked about the agreement in principle the UK government has reached with Australia on future trade. Following the exit from the EU, the UK government is seeking to sign free-trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries to remove or lower tariffs. Imports from Australia currently face tariffs, making products such as Australian beef and lamb more expensive to buy in shops and supermarkets in the UK. If accepted, the deal would lead to quotas on tax-free trade being phased out over 15 years. The National Farmers' Union has warned that freeing up the UK-Australian trade in meat would lead to hundreds of British cow and sheep breeders going out of business. \"I think there are huge opportunities for Welsh lamb and Welsh beef,\" Ms Truss said. \"I think we should be proud of the product we produce - Welsh lamb is one of the best, in my opinion, in the world, and we have nothing to fear from opening up to those opportunities. \"In fact I think we've got a lot to gain.\" Ms Truss said she would be working now on getting UK lamb into the US. \"The future of Welsh lamb is very positive - it's a product people want to buy, we're seeing growing demand across the world and I think we're going to hold our own.\"",

            "title": "Southwest Airlines emergency sparks on-board safety warnings",
            "text": "For experienced flyers, the in-flight safety demonstration can seem like a mundane legal requirement that they already know inside-out. Air disasters are not very common, but on Tuesday a US woman died because of an in-flight emergency on a Southwest Airlines plane. The flight, carrying 149 passengers on a domestic US flight, made an emergency landing, but videos and images taken on board have caused alarm because many passengers appear to be using their emergency breathing masks incorrectly. Some airline staff, sick of being ignored on flights, have taken to social media to explain why passengers should start to pay attention. One tweet, posted by an experienced former flight attendant, has been shared thousands of times online. Bobby Laurie worked on US airlines for 10 years and helped develop some of the emergency training guides used by American Airlines.  He told the BBC that when he saw the footage from the flight, the masks were the first thing he noticed.  \"Obviously everyone's in a situation they didn't expect and they're panicking. But a safety demonstration is done at the start of every flight no matter where you're flying in the world!\"  In one word, \"very\" - according to experienced pilot and aviation safety expert Phil Croucher.  \"The airline can't do everything for you. There's a responsibility on the passenger as well,\" he says. \"Even if it's boring, there'll be something you've missed and you'll pick up.\"  He also strongly believes that alcohol should be banned in order to keep passengers safe and stop their judgement being clouded. For a flight attendant, being ignored can make their job feel much harder. Bobby Laurie thinks improved flight safety has led to a level of complacency in most passengers.  \"It's one of the more frustrating things of the job, you're standing in front of people trying to convey how they can save their lives in an emergency and they're texting, taking selfies, have their headphones in or they're already asleep! \"You know they didn't pay attention, and you know it's your job to get them off the plane in a life-threatening situation.\" Demonstrations, whether shown in video format or demonstrated by flight attendants, contain information on what to do in the event of an unlikely, but ultimately possible, emergency situation. Each airline and aircraft has different evacuation procedures and equipment, so experts say it is always important to watch each one. Seatbelts It is always advisable to keep your seatbelt on when seated in case of the outside chance that something unusual, like unexpected turbulence, occurs suddenly.  Bobbie Laurie faced severe and unexpected clear-air turbulence on one flight he was working on. He, and other passengers at the back of the plane at the time, hit the aircraft's ceiling. \"In that situation the seatbelt sign was turned on and there was still a line of people for the bathroom - they knew they shouldn't be out of their seats,\" he says. \"This could happen at any moment - even the flight crew don't know its coming.\" Oxygen masks Oxygen masks are used in some emergency situations. They often require activation once dropped and should be placed over the nose and mouth.  \"Not having it over your nose and mouth is kind of like scuba diving in the air - you have to consciously remember to breathe through only your mouth,\" Mr Laurie explains. The masks are important because a cabin's pressure is set at a certain altitude that is lower than the flight's cruising height itself. In an event like Tuesday's accident, an incident causing sudden cabin decompression can mean passengers' air supply is rapidly pulled from the cabin. Brace position  In any emergency landing, attendants will guide passengers on how to do the brace position correctly, and even run through practice runs during the descent. Both experts explain that the position is designed to minimise stress on the body during any descent and impact, reducing the chance of injuries such as whiplash.  Leaving personal belongings  Somewhat unbelievably, there have been instances where people have tried to grab their bags and shoes in emergencies before leaving a plane. Pilot Phil Croucher explains that planes are designed so that all passengers should be able to evacuate within 90 seconds - and says any unnecessary delay to that could prove deadly. \"People panic, they'll climb over each other and trample each other. People can get killed in the rush. You have to have a completely orderly exit,\" he explains. The phenomenon is also one of flight attendants' main pet peeves too. \"If you take your bag off the plane, it could possibly puncture the emergency slide,\" Mr Laurie says. \"It's just one big balloon - your luggage isn't designed with evacuation in mind. How will everyone else get off?\"  Accidents and emergencies are extremely rare in aviation. But extra precautions, like familiarising yourself how many rows away you are from an exit, can help massively if the unlikely does happen. \"The chances are that you're going to have a safe and comfortable flight,\" Mr Laurie explains. \"But at any time that could change - so just take a minute and open up safety cards, see where the exits are, review how to put on the oxygen mask - and then put on your headphones and take your selfies!\" ",

            "text": "Europe's aviation safety watchdog will not accept a US verdict on whether Boeing's troubled 737 Max is safe. Instead, the European Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) will run its own tests on the plane before approving a return to commercial flights. The 737 Max has been grounded since March after two fatal crashes.   But Easa told the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) there would be \"no delegation\" on safety approval in a letter sent on 1 April.  Patrick Ky, Easa's chief executive, revealed a list of four conditions given to the US authorities in a presentation to the European Parliament's committee on transport and tourism on Monday. Europe's tough stance is a blow to Boeing's hopes of a rapid return to service for the 737 Max, and is also a significant break with the established international practice of aviation regulators accepting each other's standards. A spokesperson for the FAA said it had \"a transparent and collaborative relationship with other civil aviation authorities as we continue our review of changes to software on the Boeing 737 Max\".  \"Our first priority is safety, and we have set no timeframe for when the work will be completed. Each government will make its own decision to return the aircraft to service, based on a thorough safety assessment.\" The 737 Max plane has not flown commercially since an Ethiopian Airlines aircraft crashed shortly after take-off on 10 March, killing 157.  It followed a Lion Air crash on 28 October last year which killed 189. In both incidents, investigators have focused on the role played by a software system called MCAS (Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System), which was designed to make the aircraft easier to fly.  Probes have shown the software - and the failure of sensors - contributed to pilots not being able to control the aircraft. Mr Ky's presentation showed a refusal to accept delegation was the first of the four conditions that had to be met before flights in Europe could resume.  The other three were:  Easa's work on the 737 Max had entailed \"an unprecedented level of effort\", with 20 aviation experts and two to three online meetings a week with Boeing engineers.  There were plans for a full week of trial flights with a modified aircraft at Boeing's flight test centre in Seattle. Boeing has been working on changes to the 737 Max's flight control systems to avoid the MCAS problem. As well as changes to the plane, it has proposed changes to the ways pilots are trained. Reports in the US have suggested that Boeing had hoped for FAA safety clearance next month, with airlines free to fly the aircraft later in the year.   FAA approval would allow US airlines to fly the aircraft, but European operators - including Norwegian Air - would need Easa clearance before returning it to commercial service.",

            "text": "Virgin Atlantic is awaiting the outcome of a key vote on a restructuring plan which is seen as vital to secure its future beyond the coronavirus crisis. The airline agreed the \u00a31.2bn rescue deal in July, but this has to be agreed by creditors. The firm is \"fundamentally sound\" but a restructuring and fresh cash injection is critical, its lawyers have said. It has warned that it could run out of cash by the end of September if the plan is not approved. The deal involves \u00a3400m in new cash, half of which will come from its main shareholder, Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group. The rest will come from investors and creditors, who now have to give their approval. Like other airlines, Virgin Atlantic's finances have been hit hard by the collapse in air travel due to the pandemic. It is cutting 3,500 staff, but the airline has said the remaining 6,500 jobs should be secure. Robert Boyle, a former director of strategy at British Airways owner IAG who now runs his own aviation consultancy, told the BBC that for the deal to go ahead, Virgin Atlantic's unsecured creditors had to agree for their repayments to be rescheduled. He said they were being asked to accept 20% less than they were owed, with the rest to be repaid over two years. Mr Boyle said the extra cash \"doesn't seem like enough to me\", given that Sir Richard had asked the government for \u00a3500m and had his request rejected. \"It will get them through maybe the next six months, when they might be in a better position to ask for more money from somewhere,\" he added. Apart from Virgin Group, Virgin Atlantic's other main shareholder is US airline Delta, which owns 49% of the airline. However, Mr Boyle said Delta was unable to invest in foreign firms because of conditions imposed when it received a $5.4bn (\u00a34.1bn) bailout from the US government in April.",

            "text": "Urgent solutions are being sought to a council's ageing workforce after warnings that its tree surgeons are \"too old to go up trees\". A report for Gateshead Council showed 29% (1,494) of its employees are aged 55 to 64. Only 12% (614) of workers are aged 25 to 34 and the authority is now advertising apprenticeships to try to recruit more young people.  A mere 5% (242) of the authority's staff are aged between 16 and 24 .\u00a0 The report to the overview and scrutiny committee illustrated a shortage of younger workers the departments of environment and fleet, property and assets, and integrated social care.\u00a0 Blaydon councillor Steve Ronchetti told the committee: \"If you look at the tree surgeons, they are too old to go up trees now and consequently the council has to bring in contractors to do the tree work, just when they are at their most expensive. \"The other thing is, looking at the age profile you're going to see over the next 10 years a massive pressure on the pension scheme.\" The Local Democracy Reporting Service revealed the current situation presented \"challenges for the council in relation to succession planning to ensure that services have staff with the right skills and experience to deliver an effective service\". The environment and fleet department has introduced an arborist apprenticeship. Dunston and Teams councillor Dot Burnett told the committee: \"We have got to identify what the issues are around recruiting people and if it's because of pay or conditions we have got to look at it.  \"If we are going to look at the age profile, we need to have a look at the whole situation as far as employment is concerned.\" Four social worker apprentices have been created and recruitment is ongoing for three adult social care employees. An urban driver apprenticeship is being offered to 12 employees in the highways and waste services department. Officers are also looking at five-year plans to ensure adequate numbers of apprentices for the construction arm of the council. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

            "text": "A passenger jet skidded off the runway and caught fire while landing in the Russian city of Sochi, injuring 18 people, officials have said. Flight UT579, a Boeing 737-800 operated by the Utair airline, was carrying 164 passengers and six crew from Moscow. Video shows fierce flames from the aircraft after it crashed through the airport fence and fell into a riverbed. Some of the injured suffered burns, others carbon monoxide poisoning, officials said. A spokesperson at Sochi airport said one airport employee had suffered a fatal heart attack during the rescue operation. The jet was attempting to land in strong wind and heavy rain early on Saturday, Russian media reported. Russia's NTV channel carried images and video of the incident. The plane's undercarriage and a wing were damaged when it left the runway and a left engine then caught fire. Three of the injured are children. Russia's Investigative Committee has launched a criminal investigation into the incident \"on suspicion of inadequate services with a risk to clients' health\". Last month, a helicopter belonging to Utair crashed in north-western Siberia, killing 18 people. The fatal crash of a Russian airliner at Moscow's Domodedovo airport in February again raised concern about national air safety. It was the third major plane crash in the country since 2015.",

            "text": "The Government expect Bombardier to lose a US trade case with Boeing in a final ruling due within weeks. But a minister has rejected criticism of Prime Minister Theresa May's lobbying efforts. Richard Harrington, a minister at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, was speaking at a Westminster committee. He said: \"The appeals the prime minister made to the president would not seem to have made a difference.\" Mrs May spoke to US President Donald Trump about the issue before the US Commerce Department decided to impose near 300% import tariffs on Bombardier's C-Series aircraft in December. It followed a complaint from rival Boeing about UK and Canadian aid to Bombardier. The US International Trade Commission is due to make a final decision in the case by the end of this month. But Mr Harrington told MPs on the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee: \"My expectation is things will not be very different from what has already been determined.\" There have been fears the outcome could impact on jobs at Bombardier in Belfast, where 1,000 workers make wings for the C-Series. The government, which is backing Bombardier in the dispute, could appeal the final outcome to the World Trade Organisation, but cases can take years to resolve. Mr Harrington said he believed the entire Boeing case was \"spurious\", adding: \"It is a complete try-on for their own anti-competitive purposes.\" In evidence last year, Boeing told the committee that Bombardier had been found \"to have violated trade law\" in a sale to the US airline, Delta. It argued: \"The US process is not political but legal and it is very simple.\" By expecting Bombardier to lose, the trade union Unite said the government was \"raising the white flag on jobs without a fight\". Its assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, said Mr Harrington's comments were \"a disgrace\".",

Now in its 14th glorious year, my Boxing Day family puzzler aims to offer hope and entertainment to those struggling to focus after the indulgence of the season. The questions relate to events from another very strange year, and all the solutions are numbers. You must use wisdom and judgement to get as close to the right figure as you can. To make it fair, each player/team should write their guesses down before revealing them. One mark for the closest answer and three if by luck, or genius, you get it spot on.

            "text": "The much-hyped boxing fight between rival YouTubers KSI and Logan Paul has ended in a draw. Briton KSI, who boasts 19.4 million subscribers, took on US star Paul, who has 18.2 million, in the tightly-contested bout at Manchester Arena.  One ringside judge had KSI ahead by one point but the other two scored it even, meaning a majority draw was declared.  The decision was greeted by booing in the arena, but both men immediately called for a rematch.  In reality, the fight was just the first of two planned bouts, with the second set to take place in the US. More than 15,000 tickets were sold for the Manchester fight, with thousands more paying \u00a37.50 each to watch it live on YouTube.   KSI and Logan Paul had whipped their fans into a frenzy before the bout with insult-filled videos flying back and forth and angry news conferences held in Los Angeles and London.  After the six-round fight, both insisted they thought they had won. KSI declared: \"I think there's only one thing to do. I think we have to have a rematch. Let's do it. That was fun.\" Paul said: \"I think it's what the people want. Let's give them a rematch.\" KSI did get one last verbal dig in at his opponent, telling him: \"I can't wait to see your bloody face all over the internet.\"  Paul dominated the first two rounds, but KSI had boasted of his greater stamina before the fight and fought his way back the longer the two men's battle went on.  They regularly taunted each other during the fight itself and exchanged insults.  One dramatic moment came when Jake Paul - Paul's brother, who had himself fought on the undercard - ran into the ring at the end of the second round to remonstrate with KSI for throwing a punch after the bell had sounded. When the draw was announced, many people declared the result an anti-climax - with some saying it was a fix to make the pair even more money.  Others, however, were impressed by what they saw. They are two of YouTube's biggest stars, both are massively divisive and both have highly controversial pasts. Olajide \"KSI\" Olatunji is a 25-year-old British gamer, comedy vlogger and rapper whose videos have racked up 4.4 billion views despite heavy criticism for lewd comments towards women in some of his clips. Logan Paul is a 23-year-old US prankster (and former state wrestler) who made his name on Vine before moving to YouTube, where he has had 3.9 billion views. He caused outrage earlier this year for showing the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan. It all started when two other YouTubers - Joe Weller and Theo Baker, AKA Malfoy - went into the ring last year, and KSI said he would fight the winner.  KSI took on the victor, Weller, at the Copper Box Arena in London in February, and won.  It was streamed live on YouTube for free, with 1.8 million people watching live and 36 million more watching on the pair's official channels since. Following the victory KSI challenged Logan Paul and his brother Jake to take him on in the ring, saying \"they both need slaps so it makes sense for me to call them out and for us to get in the boxing ring and we can scrap\". Logan took up the offer, agreeing a two-fight deal.",
