            "text": "Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun will step down at the end of 2024 in part of a broad management shake-up for the embattled aerospace giant. Larry Kellner, chairman of the board, will not stand for reelection at Boeing's annual meeting in May, Boeing said Monday. He will be succeeded as chair by Steve Mollenkopf, who has been a Boeing director since 2020 and is a former CEO of Qualcomm. Mollenkopf will lead the board in picking a new CEO, Boeing said. And Stan Deal, president and chief executive of Boeing's commercial airplanes unit, is leaving the company effective immediately. Moving into his job is Stephanie Pope, who recently became Boeing's chief operating officer after previously running Boeing Global Services. The departures come as airlines and regulators have been increasing calls for major changes at the company after a host of quality and manufacturing flaws on Boeing planes. Scrutiny intensified after a Jan. 5 accident , when a door plug blew out of a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 minutes into an Alaska Airlines flight. \"As you all know, the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 accident was a watershed moment for Boeing,\" Calhoun wrote to employees on Monday. \"We must continue to respond to this accident with humility and complete transparency. We also must inculcate a total commitment to safety and quality at every level of our company. \"The eyes of the world are on us, and I know we will come through this moment a better company, building on all the learnings we accumulated as we worked together to rebuild Boeing over the last number of years,\" he wrote. Calhoun told CNBC in an interview Monday that the decision to resign was \"100%\" his own. \"We have another mountain to climb,\" Calhoun said. \"Let's not avoid the call for action. Let's not avoid the changes that we have to make in our factory. Let's not avoid the need to slow down a bit and let the supply chain catch up.\" Calhoun , a more than decade-long board member at Boeing, took the top job in January 2020 after the company ousted its previous chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, for his handling of the aftermath of two deadly 737 Max crashes. In 2021, Boeing's board extended the CEO's mandatory retirement age from 65 to 70, a vote of confidence in Calhoun, who turns 67 next month. For months Calhoun has promised investors, airline customers and the general public that Boeing will get its myriad quality struggles under control. The Federal Aviation Administration has stepped up oversight of Boeing, and agency Administrator Mike Whitaker after the Alaska Airlines accident said Boeing will be barred from increasing 737 production until the FAA is satisfied with the company's quality control. BA .SPX 5Y line Boeing's share price compared with the S & P 500 Boeing's production problems have delayed deliveries of new planes to customers and hampered growth plans. CEOs of some of the company's largest customers, including United Airlines , Southwest Airlines and American Airlines have publicly complained about the delays. Ryanair, Boeing's largest airline customer in Europe, said in a statement Monday it welcomes the management changes. \"Stan Deal has done a great sales job for Boeing for many years, but he's not the person to turn around the operation in Seattle, and that's where most of the problems have been in recent years,\" Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said in a video posted to social media platform X. United's CEO, Scott Kirby, earlier this month said he urged Boeing to stop making yet-to-be-certified Max 10 planes for the company because it wasn't clear when the FAA would clear those aircraft to fly. Last week, airline CEOs started scheduling meetings with Boeing directors to voice their displeasure at the lack of manufacturing quality controls and lower-than-expected production of 737 Max planes. The meetings were to include Kellner and one or more other board members. Those meetings will go ahead with Mollenkopf, according to people familiar with the matter. Also last week, Boeing Chief Financial Officer Brian West said at an industry conference that Boeing would burn more cash than expected because of limited 737 Max production. Boeing's stock added 1.4% on Monday after the announcements. Its shares are down more than 26% so far this year.",

            "text": "The process of buying a home has seemingly never been simpler: Find a property on a listings website like Zillow, Redfin or Trulia; reach out to the listing agent; tour the property; and make an offer. But for years behind the scenes, experts say, consumers have not been fully aware of the ultimate cost — and potential conflicts of interest — when searching for a home. Now, a landmark settlement with the National Association of Realtors is poised to upend this model. According to consumer advocates, and even some Realtors, it's a win for homebuyers and sellers. \"Price transparency is a good thing, increased competition is a good thing, and this will increase both,\" said Mariya Letdin, an associate professor at Florida State University's College of Business. \"I really welcome this change.\" When someone goes looking for a home today, they are in most cases intercepted by a broker who has access to certain listings and who will work with the buyer at no cost upfront to help them get into a home. But therein lies a common misconception, experts interviewed by NBC News said. Although a homeowner who puts their property up for sale must hire professionals to market their home, they usually fold that cost into the final price paid by the buyer. \"The buyer brings the entire purchase price to the table,\" Letdin said. \"And the seller gets to keep a little bit more of that after this ruling.\" As part of the new settlement, the buyer should now be fully apprised upfront about any potential fees or commissions they'll ultimately have to pay. That's because the agreement requires that a buyer sign a formal contract with a broker laying out what services they'll be receiving, and for how much. Alternatively, a homebuyer could decide not to hire a broker and instead put their search costs toward a real estate lawyer, appraiser or someone else with knowledge of the housing market, experts say. And a seller could even offer to cover the cost of the buyer's team as an incentive to attract more buyers. Of course, for a property that's garnering a lot of attention, such buyer incentives are unlikely to be on the table. And in the months following Covid-19 pandemic reopenings, the hottest U.S. real estate markets were tipped squarely in favor of sellers. But now, with home price growth leveling off, the playing field is leveling out too, putting more buyers in the driver's seat, experts say. \"Now you can hire an attorney for $1,500, instead of paying a $50,000 commission,\" said Doug Miller, a real estate lawyer based in Minnesota who helped launch the actions that led to the NAR settlement. Whomever a prospective buyer chooses as their representative in the homebuying process, the NAR settlement now formally bans the seller's ability to advertise a commission for the buyer's reps on the multiple listing service. More from NBC News: Home buyers and sellers to be spared standard broker commissions under $418 million settlement Infrastructure money is helping airports add toilets, gates and boarding bridges Some nervous travelers are changing their flights to avoid Boeing airplanes For its part, the NAR has maintained that the free market has always set commission levels, and that they were always negotiable — and even useful. \"Offers of compensation help make professional representation more accessible, decrease costs for home buyers to secure these services, increase fair housing opportunities, and increase the potential buyer pool for sellers,\" the NAR said in its March 15 statement announcing the agreement. But in most cases, there was little difference in the amount being offered for those commissions in a given market — usually about 3%. That's because any attempt to offer a lower commission to a buyer's agent would likely motivate the agent to direct their client away from that property. Miller characterized that behavior as improper and said buyers, in many cases, would have had no awareness of it. \"The future here is that buyers will now be in the driver's seat,\" Miller said. \"Instead of that [commission] money going to their agent ... it can now go directly to the buyer. It's the same amount of money, but now the buyer gets money instead of a buyer agent, and they can decide what to do with it.\" What's more, greater competition for clients is likely to result in lower costs across the board, said Ryan Tomasello, a real estate industry analyst with the Keefe, Bruyette & Woods financial firm. \"When you introduce a ton of transparency to a marketplace that has historically lacked it, any economist will tell you that reduces friction costs — i.e., commissions — and those are some of the highest in the world,\" Tomasello said. \"So the all-in cost of buying and selling a home, in theory, is going to decline.\" Many experts, including other real estate professionals, agree that the settlement will effectively thin the ranks of fly-by-night agents who served as an intermediary — a phenomenon that surged during the pandemic-era housing boom. \"A lot of folks parachuted in during 2020-2021 to try to make easy extra money by putting themselves out there as a buyer agent and taking 3%,\" said Phil Crescenzo Jr., vice president of the Southeast division at Nation One Mortgage Corp. \"But they weren't bringing 3% of value — not even close.\" Crescenzo compared it to moonlighting mortgage brokers who helped fuel the housing bubble of the mid-to-late 2000s. \"Once they changed the compensation rules, the dominant professionals rose to the top, the bottom disappeared, and the industry got better,\" Crescenzo said.",

            "text": "United Airlines said late Friday that U.S. safety regulators will boost scrutiny of the airline after a series of recent safety incidents. United's corporate safety vice president, Sasha Johnson, said in a memo that over the next several weeks employees will see more of a presence by the Federal Aviation Administration \"in our operation as they begin to review some of our work processes, manuals and facilities.\" The Chicago-based airline has experienced several emergencies in the past two weeks. On March 15 , an external panel was found to be missing from a United aircraft when it landed in Oregon, prompting an FAA investigation. Before that incident, a United Airlines-operated Boeing 737 MAX rolled onto the grass in Houston. A United-operated Boeing 777-200 bound for Japan also lost a tire after takeoff from San Francisco and was diverted to Los Angeles, where it landed safely. The incidents \"have rightfully caused us to pause and evaluate whether there is anything we can and should do differently,\" Johnson's memo said adding \"We welcome their engagement and are very open to hear from them about what they find and their perspective on things we may need to change to make us even safer.\" On Tuesday, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker told Reuters the agency was going to look at United more closely, saying United CEO Scott Kirby \"knows we're going to be engaging a little more closely with them as we look into these.\" Asked for comment on United's memo, the FAA said on Friday it \"routinely monitors all aspects of an airline's operation\" including \"compliance with applicable regulations; ability to identify hazards, assess and mitigate risk; and effectively manage safety.\" Scrutiny on planemaker Boeing has also mounted since a Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines mid-air emergency, with inquiries into safety and quality standards in its production process. Asked about additional attention many aviation incidents are drawing, Whitaker said some events getting coverage are not necessarily unusual but the FAA investigates to ensure there is no broader safety trend. Whitaker said it is important \"to try to separate the signal from the noise.... The system works well because it has a lot of redundancy built into it, a lot of resilience.\"",

I think it's not helpful for the industry, and if it's not helpful for the industry, it's not helpful for Airbus,\" Thomas Toepfer told CNBC's Charlotte Reed in an interview Thursday. \"We do think that we have very good products. And we have seen this in the very good order intake that we've seen in 2023. And that is simply continuing also in 2024.\" Boeing is under intense pressure after a series of costly and reputationally damaging incidents. A door plug on one of its 737 Max 9 aircraft blew out during an Alaska Airlines flight on Jan. 5, over which it is now facing a lawsuit and a Federal Aviation Administration investigation . That came after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving the 737 Max, its bestselling aircraft, which dented public trust in the company and raised serious questions about its culture and quality control processes. Concerns have meanwhile mounted that plane makers are under too much pressure to increase the speed of production as airlines face a capacity crunch. Toepfer told CNBC, \"The way I would look at it is ... it's a factor that makes us even think more, how can we make sure that these things will never happen at Airbus?\" \"We're obsessed by the thought, and therefore we have put even more scrutiny in terms of our production processes. We have even put more emphasis on the long-term investments that we're making in terms of products, but also technology. And I think that has served us very well in the past, we're continuing exactly along this path.\" Aviation bosses — many of whom have large outstanding Boeing orders — have generally expressed their ongoing confidence in the company over the last six years of turmoil. However, a group of airline chief executives recently requested a meeting with Boeing's board to express their concern over the Alaska Airlines fiasco and production issues, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. Michael O'Leary, the outspoken head of low-cost carrier Ryanair, sharply criticized Boeing's handling of the 737 Max crisis and its leadership in an interview with Skift this week. Like other airlines, Ryanair has made the highly efficient, single-aisle jet core to its growth and fleet renewal strategy.",

            "text": "Intuitive Machines is building on the successes of its inaugural moon mission, reporting fourth-quarter results on Thursday and saying it now has \"sufficient capital for the near term.\" The lunar company revealed that its cash balance at the end of the year was just $4.5 million – partly the result of paying down $12 million in debt off its balance sheet. Following its historic February moon landing , the company saw about $50 million in \"warrant exercises from an institutional investor,\" and raised $10 million through equity. Intuitive Machines highlighted that its cash balance of nearly $55 million on March 1 was \"the largest balance relative to any quarter-end since the Company's IPO.\" \"We come into 2024 from a position of financial strength. We've expanded our cash position with lower debt, we've grown backlog, our margins are improving, and our future opportunities are brighter than ever,\" Intuitive Machines interim Chief Financial Officer Steve Vontur said on the company's earnings call. Intuitive Machines' net income for the fourth quarter was $4.6 million, down 63% from $12.4 million in the same period a year prior. Revenue was also lower for the quarter, at $30.6 million, representing a 20% year over year drop from $38 million a year ago. Shares of Intuitive Machines slipped 2% in trading Thursday from its previous close of $5.61. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC's Investing in Space newsletter . The company pointed to its recently improved backlog, as well as a number of upcoming potential NASA contracts, as further bolstering the momentum gained by the company's inaugural moon mission. Overall, Intuitive Machines had a nearly $270 million backlog at the end of the year. \"We expect sales to expand significantly this year based on the current backlog,\" Vontur said. Intuitive Machines began realizing revenue from a multiyear engineering services contract from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, with $12.5 million from work done in December – a monthly rate the company expects to continue in the year ahead. Additionally, the Houston-based company highlighted three upcoming potential NASA contract awards, including to build an astronaut-capable moon rover, provide lunar data services, and additional moon mission contracts. The first of those awards, NASA's Lunar Terrain Vehicle program, is scheduled to be announced on April 3. The LTV effort is planned to be a 10-year, $4.5 billion program to build a car-like rover to transport astronauts around the surface of the moon. Intuitive Machines is leading a team that includes Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and Michelin and priced its bid for a preliminary design contract at about $30 million over the course of a year. The company expects NASA will award multiple design contracts. \"We're very confident in our capability and our design, and we're looking forward to hearing about that,\" Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said. Preparing for second mission Intuitive Machines flew its first cargo mission, called IM-1 , to the moon last month. The lander touched down successfully before tipping over, but was still able to operate for about a week on the surface in a historic first for a private mission. Intuitive Machines completed a review of its first lunar cargo mission, Altemus said, and has now \"identified the areas that needed adjustment\" for its second effort. \"We are still planning for a 2024 mission for IM-2,\" Altemus said. The company highlighted a number of milestones completed toward the launch of the IM-2 flight, including testing of different payloads Intuitive Machines' lander will carry – including its \"rocket-powered drone\" Micro Nova and a NASA ice mining drill.",

            "text": "Boeing said on Wednesday it would burn more cash in the first quarter than previously expected and pushed back a company cash-flow goal as it constrains 737 production to improve quality amid a worsening crisis at the U.S. planemaker. CFO Brian West said Boeing would produce fewer than the maximum 38 737 aircraft allowed each month under a Federal Aviation Administration imposed limit. Shares of the company were down 1% before the bell. \"We're deliberately going to slow to get this right,\" West told a Bank of America conference. \"We are the ones who made the decision to constrain rates on the 737 program...And we'll feel the impact of that over the next several months.\" Manufacturing quality at Boeing and major supplier Spirit AeroSystems is under scrutiny following a Jan. 5 incident in which a door plug blew off a 737 MAX 9 plane mid-flight. The two companies are now engaged in tie-up talks. West added that Boeing's cash burn in the first quarter will be somewhere between $4 billion and $4.5 billion, \"higher than we originally planned back in January.\" That is due to a combination of lower deliveries, lower production volumes at its commercial division as well as some working capital pressure. It will also take longer for Boeing to hit a goal outlined in 2022 of achieving annual cash flow of about $10 billion by 2025 or 2026. \"It's going to take us longer to get there than we planned,\" West said, without elaborating further. \"But we believe that the actions that we're taking right now better position us for that long term.\" West said margins at the commercial airplanes business would be \"more like negative 20%\" in the first quarter, in part due to customer compensation for delivery delays. They will improve through the year but still be negative overall in 2024, he added. The CFO said that in future Boeing would only take deliveries of fully conforming fuselages from Spirit. Spirit currently assembles the fuselage for the 737 before it is shipped to a Boeing factory in Washington state to be completed. The door panel that blew off the 737 MAX 9 jet appeared to be missing four key bolts, according to a preliminary report from U.S. investigators. \"For years, we prioritized the movement of the airplane through the factory over getting it done right, and that's got to change,\" West said. On a possible buyout of Spirit, West said Boeing would fund any deal with a mix of cash and debt, rather than using stock.",

            "text": "United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby on Monday sought to reassure customers about the carrier's safety after a series of flight problems in recent weeks. In one incident this month, a tire fell from one of the carrier's Japan-bound Boeing 777s shortly after takeoff, damaging cars in a San Francisco airport parking lot. In another, a missing panel from the plane was discovered after the older Boeing 737 landed in Oregon on Friday. \"Safety is our highest priority and is at the center of everything we do,\" Kirby said in an email to customers. \"Unfortunately, in the past few weeks, our airline has experienced a number of incidents that are reminders of the importance of safety.\" Kirby said the incidents, which the Federal Aviation Administration is investigating, were \"all unrelated\" but that the team is reviewing the details \"and using those insights to inform our safety training and procedures across all employee groups.\" The string of recent mishaps occurred during heightened scrutiny of the aviation industry after a door plug panel blew off an Alaska Airlines ' nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 on Jan. 5. On March 8, a United 737 Max plane rolled off a Houston runway. On March 4, a United Boeing 737 that was heading to Florida from Houston returned to the airport after the engine ingested plastic bubble wrap, with video on social media showing flames coming out of the engine. United's CEO said the airline had already planned to implement changes such as \"an extra day of in-person training for all pilots starting in May and a centralized training curriculum for our new-hire maintenance technicians.\" \"You can be confident that every time a United plane pulls away from the gate, everyone on our team is working together to keep you safe on your trip,\" Kirby wrote.",

The reported move for the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which oversees $925 billion in assets, would track with its goals to invest heavily in tourism and transport assets, as it aims to turn Saudi Arabia into a tourist hub and diversify its economy away from oil. According to the initial report, the acquisition would see the PIF take over the airline's ownership from the government to increase its efficiency and ability to make profit. It could then either be privatized or merged with Riyadh Air, a separate airline owned by the PIF and launched in March 2023 to compete with other more established Gulf airlines. Founded in 1945, Saudia has a fleet of 144 aircraft — 93 Airbus planes and 51 made by Boeing — and flies to more than 100 destinations, according to its website. It is not yet known how the airline would be valued. Talks are said to be in early stages, and could be delayed or axed altogether, Bloomberg reported. Read the full report here .",

            "title": "In shadow of Trump tweets, Supreme Court outlines when officials can be sued for social media use",
            "text": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled Friday that members of the public in some circumstances can sue public officials for blocking them on social media platforms, deciding a pair of cases against the backdrop of former President Donald Trump's contentious and colorful use of Twitter. The court ruled unanimously that officials can be deemed \"state actors\" when making use of social media and can therefore face litigation if they block or mute a member of the public. In the two cases before the justices, they ruled that disputes involving a school board member in Southern California and a city manager in Michigan should be sent back to lower courts for the new legal test to be applied. In a ruling written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the court acknowledged that it \"can be difficult to tell whether the speech is official or private\" because of how social media accounts are used. The court held that conduct on social media can be viewed as a state action when the official in question \"possessed actual authority to speak on the state's behalf\" and \"purported to exercise that authority.\" While the officials in both cases have low profiles, the ruling will apply to all public officials who use social media to engage with the public. During October's oral argument , Trump's use of Twitter — before it was renamed X — was frequently mentioned as the justices considered the practical implications. The cases raised the question of whether public officials' posts and other social media activity constitute part of their governmental functions. In ruling that it can, the court found that blocking someone from following an official constitutes a government action that could give rise to a constitutional claim. But the court made it clear that conditions have to be met for a claim to move forward, with Barrett noting that government officials are also \"private citizens with their own constitutional rights.\" Determining whether a claim can move forward is not based simply on whether the person is a government official, but on the substance of the conduct in question, she added. More from NBC News: Seat belt saved passenger's life on Boeing Alaska Airlines flight that suffered door panel blowout, new lawsuit claims A Haitian woman escaped gunshots and terror in Port-au-Prince only to lose contact with her husband Matt Gaetz subpoenaed in friend's lawsuit accusing others of defamation in sex trafficking probe Factors such as whether the account is marked as official and the official is invoking his or her legal authority in making a formal announcement can be taken into account, Barrett said. \"In some circumstances, the post's content and function might make the plaintiff's argument a slam dunk,\" she added Trump himself was sued when he was president, with the courts ruling against him, noting that he often used his Twitter account to make official announcements. But that lawsuit was tossed out as moot once he left office in January 2021. At that point, Twitter had disabled Trump's account, although the company's new owner, Elon Musk, has reversed course as part of a major overhaul that has included changing the site's name. In other disputes, however, courts have reached other conclusions. The California case arose after two members of the Poway Unified School District Board of Trustees, Michelle O'Connor-Ratcliff and T.J. Zane, blocked parents Christopher and Kimberly Garnier from commenting on their Facebook page in 2017. O'Connor-Ratcliff also prevented Christopher Garnier from responding to her Twitter posts. Zane has since left office. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2022 ruled for the couple, upholding a similar decision by a federal judge in the Southern District of California. The appeals court concluded that the elected officials were acting in their official capacities. The dispute in Michigan began in March 2020, when Port Huron City Manager James Freed, an appointed official who described himself on his Facebook page as a \"public figure,\" posted information there about the city's efforts to deal with the Covid pandemic. After resident Kevin Lindke posted comments criticizing the city's response, Freed blocked him. Freed argued that the no-longer-active Facebook page was a personal page that he used to share pictures of his family and comment on his daily activities. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, upholding a lower court decision, agreed in June 2022 that Freed was not acting in his official capacity and that therefore his Facebook activity did not constitute state action. Freed's page was somewhat different from the ones at issue in the school board case because it included a lot more personal content, making it much less clear whether it was an official page. The court is wrestling with a whole series of social media-related free speech issues in its current term, which runs until June.",

            "text": "Qatar Airways is developing a First Class concept and pursuing aircraft orders from aviation giants Boeing and Airbus, as part of a broader strategic overhaul under new group CEO Badr Mohammed Al Meer. \"This is a new era,\" Al Meer told CNBC on Thursday, unveiling changes at the airline that follow a multi-month \"war room\" review. Formerly the chief operating officer of Qatar's Hamad International Airport, Al Meer took over from long-time predecessor Akbar Al Baker as Qatar Airways CEO in November and seeks to refresh the airline's strategy and reset supplier relationships. Al Meer confirmed to CNBC that Qatar Airways is now developing a high-yielding First Class concept for its cabins. \"We wanted to combine the experience of flying commercial and flying on a private jet and develop something new,\" he said. \"We are 70% to 80% ready. We are only finalizing colors and small touches, but hopefully we will be able to announce it very soon.\" First Class seating typically offers a more spacious, premium quality and higher cost experience aboard an aircraft. Some airlines have abandoned, reduced or rebranded First Class seats in a bid to maximize aircraft space and offer more economic seating for budget-conscious travelers. Along with preparing its First Class proposal, Qatar Airways is redesigning its premium \"Q-Suite\" class of seats, and the latest offering is set to debut at the Farnborough International Airshow in July. New orders The Gulf carrier has also submitted a Request for Proposal to Boeing and Airbus for a \"big\" new aircraft order, Al Meer said. \"We released an RFP to create some competition between both suppliers,\" he noted, without disclosing specifics. \"We will go through the process, and, with an order this big, we need to take our time.\" Al Meer wants to enhance the service offering and capitalize on momentum following the Qatar World Cup, which helped the airline deliver a record net profit of $1.21 billion in the fiscal year 2022-23, as well as the highest yields and load factors in its history. \"The markets that we want to grow in are China, India, Australia, Japan, Korea, and a few others,\" Al Meer said. He separately flagged that regional demand for flying is high, and passenger numbers had picked up by more than 30% in the last four months, while forecasting growth is likely to \"be more settled below 10%-15%,\" for the rest of the year. The new aircraft order proposal follows a major legal dispute between Qatar Airways and Airbus over safety concerns caused by paint degradation. It also comes amid an ongoing crisis of confidence at Boeing after the Max 9 door blowout in January raised concerns over safety, quality controls and production and delivery delays. \"We are affected when our aircrafts are not being delivered on time,\" Al Meer said. \"I know Airbus and Boeing have certain problems. We have full trust in both organizations and they're strong enough to overcome those problems.\" Al Meer noted he expects to receive Qatar's latest Boeing 777X order by the end of next year, adding he's \"110% confident\" Boeing makes safe planes. Al Meer also said Qatar Airways would halt Al Baker's plans for a fast \"phase-out\" of the flagship Airbus A380. Rival Emirates also signaled it would hold onto the airliner, despite Airbus ending its production in 2021. Next steps Al Meer has taken steps to address criticism about the airline's workplace practices, including relaxing a controversial night curfew rule for cabin crew and reversing a long-standing ban on Qatar Airways staff sharing workplace pictures on social media. \"It was very clear that we needed to do some changes there,\" Al Meer said. \"We want our staff, and we want the airline to be the people's choice when it comes to working with us.\" The strategy update comes as Qatar Airways faces renewed pressure from rival Gulf carriers, such as Emirates and Etihad, as well as upstarts like Saudi Arabia's Riyadh Air , which is also buying planes to compete on key routes in the coming years. \"Competition will help us raise the benchmark,\" Al Meer said. \"The way I see it, the pressure is Riyadh Air… they will have to compete with the best of the best.\" Al Baker played a key role in shaping Qatar Airways into a profitable global airline. He led the carrier through major events including the September 11 attacks, the global financial crisis, the Gulf diplomatic dispute, and the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, his successor wants to bring the airline into a new era — dubbed \"Qatar Airways 2.0\" — during which he did not rule out the possibility of an initial public offering. \"We might consider it in the near future,\" he said when asked if Qatar Airways could consider going public. He nevertheless stressed the decision would lie with Qatar Airways stakeholders and the Qatari Government.",

            "text": "The acting head of Europe's aviation regulator said on Wednesday the agency would halt its indirect approval of Boeing's jet production if warranted, but he feels reassured that the plane maker is tackling its latest safety crisis. In an interview with Reuters, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency's, or EASA, acting executive director, Luc Tytgat, gave the first public indication that international cooperation underpinning global airplane production was being tested by the ongoing crisis as it rarely has been. Asked if EASA would be prepared to stop recognizing U.S. production safety approvals declaring that Boeing jets are built safely, Tytgat said, \"If need be, yes.\" Boeing has been under mounting pressure over factory quality control since Jan. 5, when a door plug tore off a 737 MAX 9 jet in mid-air in an incident blamed on missing bolts . The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, said last week an audit of Boeing and supplier Spirit AeroSystems found multiple instances of poor controls. Under a transatlantic pact, the FAA and EASA regulate the factories of their respective plane makers — Boeing and Airbus — and recognize each other's safety approvals. However, if one side loses confidence in the other's compliance checks, it can call for consultations and, if those fail, suspend recognition after a pause of 30 days. Such steps are rare. \"All the tools must be implementable as soon as we see the justification or situation that requires us to take appropriate measures,\" Tytgat said, adding that no such action was imminent. EASA's influence over the design of Boeing planes has grown following the MAX crashes, but it has relatively few ways to increase its monitoring of the production of existing Boeing models other than the drastic option of suspending recognition. Pressed on what would push EAA to go that far, Tytgat said, speaking only for himself, \"More fatal accidents in the future.\" The FAA did not comment directly on the EASA remarks but a spokesperson reiterated the agency's earlier statements that Boeing must commit to \"real and profound improvements\". Boeing did not comment. But Tytgat did not see any immediate threat to Boeing's production certification. \"We don't see why (it) cannot be maintained today. It is more (about) the oversight and monitoring conditions that are in place.\" Tytgat said he held a discussion with senior Boeing executives on Friday that were reassuring. \"I have seen a change in the management. They put a lot of weight on quality controls, product quality and I was really reassured about the willingness of the top management to change .... production quality control,\" he said. EASA officials visited Boeing's 737 plant last week, he said. But Tytgat ruled out a permanent presence, saying it would \"not be in the spirit\" of the transatlantic safety agreement. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said on Monday that the agency would take action if it saw a reason to halt Boeing production. A decision by either of the world's two most powerful aviation regulators to upend production approval of Boeing or Airbus jets would take the safety crisis into uncharted territory and likely stir political reactions, experts said.",

In a letter to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation that is reviewing the incident and Boeing's role in it, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said her agency still lacks critical information about the chain of events that led up to the January incident that caused an Alaska Airlines flight carrying 177 people to make an emergency landing. \"We still do not know who performed the work to open, reinstall, and close the door plug on the accident aircraft,\" Homendy wrote. \"Boeing has informed us that they are unable to find the records documenting this work.\" She continued: \"A verbal request was made by our investigators for security camera footage to help obtain this information; however, they were informed the footage was overwritten. The absence of those records will complicate the NTSB's investigation moving forward.\" Homendy said in the letter that she also personally called Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun and asked him for the names of the workers who performed the work in question. But, Homendy said, Calhoun stated he was \"unable to provide that information and maintained that Boeing has no records of the work being performed.\" A Boeing spokesperson said the company, like many others, does not retain security footage for longer than 30 days. The Alaska Airlines plane in question was in the factory last year in September and delivered in October. \"We will continue supporting this investigation in the transparent and proactive fashion we have supported all regulatory inquiries into this accident,\" Boeing said. \"We have worked hard to honor the rules about the release of investigative information in an environment of intense interest from our employees, customers, and other stakeholders, and we will continue our efforts to do so.\" Homendy had previously publicly reprimanded Boeing for failing to turn over information her agency had requested, calling it \"absurd.\" Last week, NBC News confirmed a Wall Street Journal report that the U.S. Department of Justice had opened a criminal case into the incident.

            "text": "The Alaska Airlines plane that had a door panel fall off midair in January had been scheduled to undergo maintenance later that night, the airline confirmed Tuesday. The incident on Flight 1282, which took off from Portland, Oregon, at 5:07 p.m. Jan. 5, resulted in no serious injuries but sparked an investigation that revealed no bolts were installed on the door plug of the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft. The New York Times reported earlier Tuesday that the plane was scheduled for a safety check after some engineers and technicians became concerned — including about a light indicating problems with the plane's pressurization system — and that it was kept in service with some restrictions. Alaska Airlines told the newspaper that the warnings it had on the plane did not meet its standards to immediately take it out of service. Alaska confirmed to NBC News that the plane was scheduled to head for maintenance later the night of Jan. 5. The airline said in a statement that it, like other airlines, relies on \"redundant systems, robust processes and procedures, and the willingness to stop and ensure things are right before every takeoff,\" and it said safety guides its decisions. Flight 1282 was on a path from Portland to Ontario, California, when the door plug blew out at around 16,000 feet, officials said. The plane returned to Portland. Oxygen masks deployed as the plane made an emergency return. Boeing has been under scrutiny following the failure of the door plug, which is a panel that seals where a door would be and makes it part of the fuselage. Some Boeing 737 Max 9 planes were temporarily grounded , and Boeing ousted the executive in charge of the 737 Max program. The door plug was later found in the backyard of a Portland-area home.

The plane had 510 flight hours and 154 cycles, which is a flight from takeoff to landing, the agency said. \"We remain confident in our maintenance and safety actions leading up to the incident,\" Alaska Airlines said in the statement Tuesday. \"We look forward to continuing our participation in a robust investigation led by the NTSB to ensure something like this never happens again.\" There were 177 people aboard the plane, including flight and cabin crew members, and when the door plug fell off, it caused a rapid decompression, the NTSB said. Seven passengers and a flight attendant sustained minor injuries, it said. The NTSB announced Tuesday it will hold an investigative hearing on Aug. 6 and 7.",

            "text": "If we were to fall asleep today and not wake up for another 35 years, we'd wake up feeling underwhelmed at the pace of innovation. That's according to Robert Blumofe, chief technology officer of web security firm Akamai, who thinks the world may be \"wildly disappointed\" by progress made on the web in the next three decades. Akamai, a content delivery network, helps internet users access web content fast. Tuesday marked 35 years to the day since renowned computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee submitted his proposal for what would eventually be known as the \"World Wide Web.\" But Blumofe, who noted he's still a believer in the web and modern technology, cautioned we could be in for stagnation. \"The next 35 years might be wildly disappointing,\" Blumofe told CNBC in an interview last week. \"I take a bit of a contrarian view on this.\" Blumofe compared the current state of the web today to the aerospace industry in the 1960s. Back then, he said, there was huge innovation with the arrival of the Boeing 747 and the first moon landing. Today, aerospace innovation has stalled, he added. \"All that was in the 60s and 70s,\" Blumofe noted. \"If someone had gone asleep in 1975 and then woke up and looked at aerospace today they would be wildly disappointed.\" \"The planes aren't any bigger. They're not any faster,\" he said. 'Moore's law is over' Blumofe said it's entirely possible the world is heading in that same direction with telecommunications. \"We may have exhausted the steep innovation curve,\" he said. \"That curve may have passed us by. We may be heading for a plateau.\" \"Moore's law is over,\" Blumofe added, referring to the theory that the number of components on a single chip doubles every two years at minimal cost. Blumofe said much of the world now has connectivity, and modern displays on smartphones and TVs aren't getting more exciting beyond picture quality. Still, many companies are now experimenting with folding and rolling screens . While Blumofe web stagnation is a \"possibility,\" he's still hopeful innovation won't plateau. In fact, Blumofe previously told CNBC he thinks the web could eventually become the realm of artificial intelligence-powered agents — with humans no longer using the web but going through AI agents instead. Dangers of generative AI The one big exception to the rule for Blumofe at the moment is AI, which he noted could make major strides in the coming decade with the advent of generative AI algorithms. But even then, Blumofe said, AI might need to take a step back before it makes another significant leap forward. He cited the dangers of generative AI models when it comes to copyright infringement as an example. Chintan Patel, chief technology officer of enterprise tech firm Cisco in the U.K., disagrees that innovation for telecommunications and tech more broadly is set to plateau. \"The combination and speed of technological development is countering any plateau in innovation,\" Patel told CNBC. \"The pace of change has never been faster — development and innovation is occurring at pace, in different places and geographies.\" The combination and speed of technological development is countering any plateau in innovation. CTO of Cisco in the U.K. Chintan Patel Developments in AI \"are fueling a new era of innovation,\" he added, via email. \"The developer and creators of tomorrow have access to a whole set of capabilities, which the inventors of a few years ago could only dream off,\" Patel said. Brennan Smith, vice president of technology at Ookla, also doesn't think the limits of innovation have been exhausted. \"When thinking of what the next 35 years will bring, it'll be a new era of creativity unlocked by generative AI, combined with a medium that blends the digital and physical world seamlessly,\" Smith told CNBC. \"We may still read words on a document no different than a stone tablet, but we will be surrounded by entirely new experiences which make our existing world even richer and more vibrant,\" Smith added. However, he said \"enormous amounts of bandwidth\" will be required to support future web experiences. Last week, Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, told CNBC his top predictions for the future of his creation . He said he expects everyone to have their own personal AI assistants and greater ownership of data, wresting it from the hands of Big Tech platforms. Berners-Lee also said regulatory agencies could in the future decide to break up a big tech firm, particularly in the age of AI. However, he said it's unclear at this stage which tech giant would be forced to split up. \"Things are changing so quickly. AI is changing very, very quickly. There are monopolies in AI. Monopolies changed pretty quickly back in the web,\" Berners-Lee told CNBC.",

            "title": "Boeing Max crisis forces airlines to cut flights, pause hiring, CEOs say",
            "text": "Boeing 's latest Max crisis is forcing some of its biggest customers to rethink their growth plans this year — and possibly beyond, several airline CEOs said Tuesday. Their comments highlight how Boeing's top buyers have felt the effects of its problems: snowballing quality control issues, a slow increase of output and certification of new aircraft that is running years behind schedule. Southwest Airlines , which only flies Boeing 737s, trimmed its 2024 capacity forecast and said it was reevaluating its 2024 financial guidance, citing fewer Boeing deliveries than it previously expected this year: 46 Boeing 737 Max planes, down from 79. \"Boeing needs to become a better company and the deliveries will follow that,\" Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan said at a JPMorgan industry conference Tuesday. Alaska Airlines said Tuesday that its 2024 capacity estimates are \"in flux due to uncertainty around the timing of aircraft deliveries as a result of increased Federal Aviation Administration and Department of Justice scrutiny on Boeing and its operations.\" United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said at the JPMorgan conference on Tuesday that the carrier has asked Boeing to stop building Max 10 planes for the airline, an aircraft that hasn't yet been certified by the FAA, and produce more Max 9s, which are flying already. \"It's impossible to say when the Max 10 is going to get certified,\" Kirby said. In January, Kirby said the airline would build a fleet plan without the Max 10 because of the delays. On Friday, United told staff that it would have to pause pilot hiring this spring because new Boeing planes are arriving late , CNBC reported. The frustration from airline bosses has been building in recent months since Boeing's latest crisis stemmed from a door panel that blew out midair from a Max 9 plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. The accident ramped up scrutiny on Boeing, and a preliminary National Transportation Safety Board investigation said bolts on the door panel didn't appear to be attached when the planes left the company's factory in Washington state. \"We are squarely focused on implementing changes to strengthen quality across our production system and taking the necessary time to deliver high quality airplanes that meet all regulatory requirements,\" Boeing said in an emailed statement. \"We continue to stay in close contact with our valued customers about these issues and our actions to address them.\" The FAA has halted Boeing's planned output increases and said a recent audit \"identified non-compliance issues in Boeing's manufacturing process control, parts handling and storage, and product control.\" Boeing's CEO, Dave Calhoun, and other leaders have vowed to stamp out quality control problems, and have been holding a number of work pauses to discuss issues with workers. On Tuesday, Stan Deal, Boeing's commercial airplanes' unit CEO, told staff that the company would work with employees who have been found to have noncompliant issues during the audit to make sure they \"fully understand the work instructions and procedures\" and implement weekly compliance checks, and plan for more audits this month. In a note to staff, Deal said employees must \"precisely follow every step of our manufacturing procedures and processes\" and \"always be on the lookout for a potential safety hazard,\" telling employees \"you are fully empowered to report it through your manager or the Speak Up portal , so we address it right away rather than travel the risk to the next person or position.\"",

            "text": "A former Boeing quality inspector who filed a whistleblower complaint over alleged plane safety flaws was found dead \"from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound,\" officials in Charleston, South Carolina, said Monday. John Barnett, 62, spent more than three decades at the aircraft manufacturing giant and sounded the alarm with aviation authorities in 2017 over what he said were potentially \"catastrophic\" safety failings. His family said in a statement Monday that he had tried to highlight serious concerns but was met with \"a culture of concealment\" that valued \"profits over safety.\" Charleston County Coroner Bobbi Jo O'Neal said in a statement Monday that Barnett died \"from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound,\" in the South Carolina city on Saturday. The statement from Barnett's family said he had suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety attacks and that the \"hostile work environment at Boeing\" led to his death. In a statement Monday, ​Boeing said: ​​\"We are saddened by Mr. Barnett's passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.\" NBC News has asked Boeing for comment on the allegations in the Barnett family's statement. Barnett, known as Mitch to his family and \"Swampy\" to his friends, had worked at Boeing's 787 plant in Charleston, South Carolina, since 2010, his family said. In 2019, The New York Times interviewed several former Boeing employees about their safety concerns. Barnett told the paper that metal shavings — created when metal fasteners are screwed into nuts — could potentially cut wiring that connects the flight controls. The FAA ordered Boeing to clear the shavings from the Dreamliners in 2017. Boeing said then that it was following the ruling and would look to improve the design of the nut, but also said it wasn't a flight safety issue. But Barnett told The Times: \"I haven't seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I'd put my name on saying it's safe and airworthy.\" Read more on NBC News Boeing's safety culture is 'inadequate' and 'confusing,' new FAA report finds Another Boeing Max mishap: NTSB probes 'stuck' rudder pedals on United Airlines flight to New Jersey Aviation incidents seem to be proliferating, but experts say there's no reason for alarm After his retirement in 2017, Barnett filed a whistleblower complaint to federal regulators about his experiences at the South Carolina plant. He also launched a separate legal action against Boeing, accusing the company of denigrating his character and hampering his career. Boeing denied the allegations. His case was up for trial this June, the family statement said, adding: \"He was looking forward to having his day in court and hoped that it would force Boeing to change its culture.\" While Barnett loved his work for most of his career, in Charleston \"he learned that upper management was pressuring the quality inspectors and managers to cut corners\" and not to follow legally-required safety processes, the statement said. He alleged that staff were pressured not to document defects because it would slow down the assembly line, it added. \"John told us that every day was a battle to get management to do the right thing,\" the family said. The statement added that Barnett and others who highlighted problems were labeled as \"trouble-makers,\" whereas previously the company had rewarded those who discovered defects. \"It caused John so much stress that his doctor told him that if he stayed, he would have a heart attack,\" the family said. \"Mitch was fun-loving, and totally devoted to family, especially his nieces and nephews and great nieces and nephews,\" an obituary shared by the family said. It added that he is survived by his mother, Vicky Melder Stokes; brothers, Mike Barnett, Robbie Barnett, and Rodney Barnett; eight nieces and nephews and 11 great-nieces and nephews. The news comes as Boeing faces regulatory and public scrutiny over a series of incidents involving its planes. A Justice Department investigation has been opened after a door plug blew out on an Alaska Airlines flight in January which led to the temporary grounding of some Boeing 737 Max 9 airplanes, although they have since returned to the air. And on Monday, 50 people were injured on a Boeing Dreamliner plane after a sudden movement mid-air, on a flight from Sydney to Auckland, New Zealand.

So far this year, Boeing has handed over 54 planes, while Airbus has widened its lead over its main rival, delivering 79 planes in the first two months of 2024. Delayed Boeing planes have been difficult for airline leaders. Southwest Airlines , which flies only Boeing 737s, on Tuesday said that it would trim capacity plans this year because of fewer Boeing Max deliveries and that it will have to reevaluate its 2024 financial estimates. United Airlines earlier this year said it was taking the 737 Max 10 , which hasn't yet been certified, out of its fleet plans. Boeing's February deliveries included 17 Max jetliners and seven wide-body 787-9 Dreamliners. Deliveries are important to manufacturers because customers pay the bulk of the aircraft's price when they receive the plane. Boeing logged 15 gross orders for new planes in February, while Airbus sold just two. And customers aren't abandoning Boeing because of its recent struggles.

The Federal Aviation Administration started the probe after a door panel blew off a 737 Max 9 flight on Alaska Airlines in early January, an incident that has attracted intense scrutiny of Boeing's quality-control practices. The NYT report, published Tuesday, was based on a review of an internal FAA slide presentation and offered a glimpse into the numerous issues found by auditors. Many of the problems fell under the category of failure to follow \"approved manufacturing processes\" and failure to keep proper quality control documentation, according to the Times. FAA auditors found that out of 89 product audits that were conducted, Boeing passed 56 tests and failed 33 of them, according to the report. During the six-week audit, the FAA also conducted 13 product audits that focused on Spirit AeroSystems, which makes fuselages for the Boeing 737 Max — of those, only six audits resulting in passing grades, and seven failed, the NYT said. A document reviewed by the Times found that a mechanic at Spirit used a hotel key card to check a door seal. In another instance, the FAA reportedly saw Spirit mechanics apply liquid Dawn soap to a door seal to use as a lubricant in the \"fit-up process.\" A spokesman for Spirit reportedly said the company was \"reviewing all identified nonconformities for corrective action.\" In late February, the FAA gave Boeing 90 days to develop a plan for quality-control improvements. Around the same time, an expert panel's report on Boeing found a \"disconnect\" between its senior management and employees regarding safety culture. The panel report had been required by the U.S. Congress after two crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving Boeing 737 Max planes killed all the passengers and crew aboard — a total of 346 people. In response to the NYT report and recent expert panel report, Boeing said it continues \"to implement immediate changes and develop a comprehensive action plan to strengthen safety and quality.\" \"We are squarely focused on taking significant, demonstrated action with transparency at every turn,\" Boeing said in a statement to CNBC. In addition to the FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board is looking into what caused the 737 Max jet door panel to blow off during the Alaska Airlines incident, and the Justice Department has reportedly begun a criminal investigation into the company. — CNBC's Phil LeBeau contributed to this report.

            "title": "'Do I regret it? No’: AirAsia’s Tony Fernandes discusses viral topless LinkedIn post ",
            "text": "AirAsia founder and CEO Tony Fernandes says he does not regret the viral LinkedIn post that showed him receiving a massage during a meeting — and that transparency is worth potential controversy. The Malaysian businessman is known for an unfiltered approach to posting on social media. He does not get his posts vetted by his PR team and wants to keep it that way, he told CNBC in a wide-ranging interview last month. \"I am transparent, and social media allows me to be very transparent. It has a disadvantage, that people will misrepresent and misunderstand Tony Fernandes the persona,\" he said. Recent widely shared posts have seen Fernandes jokily tell off a passenger for bringing food onto a flight, against the budget airline's policy. He also generated some skepticism after stating that he had been forced to fly with rival Singapore Airlines because AirAsia flights were full. But by far the strongest reaction to a social media post by Fernandes came in October, when the businessman shared a photograph of himself shirtless in the office. \"Got to love Indonesia and AirAsia culture that I can have a massage and do a management meeting,\" the post read, prompting a slew of comments and media coverage. Fernandes told CNBC: \"My famous topless sports massage was all about showing our culture, to be honest, that we had such a flexible culture. Of course, I got permission from everyone in the room to say, are you okay?\" \"Initially I asked whether we could delay the meeting so that I could have a massage, I was in a lot of pain from a lot of flying. But the team said, we're okay, you know, nothing to hide. We'd rather not delay it. So I was actually posting to say, what an amazing culture we have.\" However, the message got twisted and prompted a backlash, he said. Despite this, he insisted: \"Do I regret it? No. Got me a lot of publicity.\" While some of the online comments poked fun at the post, others made more serious objections, calling it inappropriate and observing that staff may have felt uncomfortable and unable to challenge their boss. \"Appropriate is whatever people around you deem appropriate, right? I could have had a meeting on the beach with Richard Branson and my management staff, and everyone would have said, how cool is that?\" Fernandes said. \"You can't have a more diverse airline such as ours, our top management is mostly women ... we have such a flat, fun, transparent, direct culture,\" he added. 'Best time in aviation' AirAsia's oft-repeated origin story is that Fernandes and partners bought the airline — which was then just two aircraft and millions of Malaysian ringgit in debt — from the Malaysian government in 2001, for less than one U.S. dollar. It has since expanded to a fleet of more than 200 aircraft with a focus on low-cost flights across the ten-nation ASEAN group and connections to the wider region. It currently operates under two companies, Capital A -owned Air Asia and the medium-haul Air Asia X . The process is underway, subject to approvals, to merge the two firms into one group. A restructuring aimed at lifting Capital A out of financially distressed status is also being pursued, and last month the company finalized a deal that will see its brand licensing unit list on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Fernandes told CNBC that pandemic struggles had necessitated a plan for \"surviving,\" which included setting up logistics, engineering and digital divisions. However, he now sees positive longer-term consequences for both AirAsia and the aviation industry as a result of the turmoil, noting that both airlines have been reporting record profits . \"I think we [now] have the best time in aviation,\" he said. \"If you think about history of aviation, America went through lots of ups and downs and a lot of consolidation ... Europe went through the same thing, there were a lot of state-owned carriers which threw a lot of valuations out by crazy pricing, or state subsidies,\" Fernandes added. \"ASEAN was in that position with a lot of state-owned airlines being subsidized and throwing fares and being irresponsible. Covid has taught everyone a lesson. So that is one positive for me, in that we now have a rational market.\" He said fares had risen by 30% and weren't coming down anytime soon, with airline capacity unlikely to change over the next five to six years. This is in part due to a backlog in aircraft orders that manufacturers are struggling to keep up with. \"We have an advantage of a 400 plane order book, but many airlines don't have that ... If you buy a plane now you won't get one till 2031,\" he said. Fernandes said AirAsia had been \"lucky\" as an Airbus -only customer to swerve the ongoing turbulence at Boeing with its 737 Max aircraft, though he added that he believed the U.S. planemaker would \"come out of [it] stronger.\" Travel trends Fernandes said he sees some resurgence in demand from China, but just as good, if not better, opportunities in the Indian market. Post-pandemic, Asian travelers are showing a preference for regional journeys and even domestic ones — partly because of the current \"jingoistic\" climate, he said. He is, meanwhile, excited by the potential for new long-range aircraft, particularly Airbus's A321 XLR, its long-range, single-aisle plane. \"That's going to enable us to create a long-range, medium-haul low-cost carrier that can span 10 hours ... So it means that dream of having a narrow-body to take you around the world, as opposed to a wide-body which is much more expensive,\" Fernandes said. \"That would be a very exciting concept, creating an Emirates or a Qatar, but on narrow-body.\"",

The investigation would help the DOJ its in review of whether Boeing complied with an previous settlement of a federal investigation into two fatal 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019, the Journal said. \"In an event like this, it's normal for the DOJ to be conducting an investigation,\" an Alaska Airlines spokesperson said. \"We are fully cooperating and do not believe we are a target of the investigation.\" The DOJ declined to comment. Boeing didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. Boeing 737 Max 9 planes flown by Alaska have resumed regular service after being grounded for inspections. Alaska and United Airlines, the two U.S. carriers that fly the Max 9, canceled thousands of flights in January after the incident. Three passengers are suing Boeing and Alaska Airlines for $1 billion in damages, accusing Boeing and Alaska Airlines of negligence for allegedly having ignored warning signs. Alaska Airlines earlier estimated that the weekslong grounding of the Boeing 737 Max 9 will cost the carrier $150 million. — Read the original WSJ story here. — CNBC's Rebecca Picciotto contributed reporting.",

            "text": "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating an United Airlines , Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight last month that experienced \"stuck\" rudder pedals during the landing rollout, the agency said on Thursday. The NTSB said in a preliminary report on the Feb. 6 flight that the plane taxied to the gate at Newark Airport without incident and there were no injuries to the 161 passengers and crew. It reported that the captain said that during the landing rollout, the rudder pedals did not move in response to \"normal\" application of foot pressure while attempting to maintain the runway centerline. Boeing said it worked with United \"to diagnose the rudder response issue observed during two 737-8 flights in early February. With coordination with United, the issue was successfully resolved with the replacement of three parts and the airplane returned to service last month.\" Boeing said this is only report of this issue in the 737 MAX fleet. The rudder pedal system is identical to the prior generation 737 NG and the plane maker is aware of two similar occurrences in 2019 on NGs that were resolved through component replacements. United did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Federal Aviation Administration referred questions to the NTSB. Boeing has been under scrutiny in recent months after a Jan. 5 mid-air blowout on another plane model, a Boeing 737 MAX 9. Last month, the FAA formally mandated inspections in Boeing 737 MAX airplanes for loose bolts in the rudder control systems after the plane maker recommended them in December. The NTSB report said the captain said that in the MAX 8 flight last month the pedals remained \"stuck\" in their neutral position and the captain used the nosewheel steering tiller to keep the airplane near the runway centerline while slowing to a safe speed before exiting the runway onto a high-speed turn-off. The NTSB said the captain asked the first officer to check his rudder pedals and the first officer reported the same problem. The captain said that shortly thereafter the rudder pedals began to operate normally. Three days after the incident, United conducted a test flight and was able to duplicate the reported rudder system malfunction identified during the incident on the same plane. Post-incident inspection found no obvious malfunctions, the NTSB said, and after removal of the rudder system components United conducted a second flight test and found the rudder controls operated normally.",

            "text": "United Airlines will pause pilot hiring this spring because of Boeing delivery delays, the latest effect of the plane maker's problems on one of its biggest customers. New hire classes will be paused in May and June and will likely resume in July, Marc Champion, vice president of flight operations, and Kirk Limacher, vice president of flight ops planning and development, told staff Thursday in a memo, which was seen by CNBC. \"We wanted to let you know that United will slow the pace of pilot hires this year due to continued new aircraft certification and manufacturing delays at Boeing,\" they wrote. Boeing declined to comment. Boeing has been struggling with a host of production flaws like incorrectly drilled holes on the fuselage and the fallout from a door plug that blew out of a nearly new Boeing Max 9 operated by Alaska Airlines on Jan. 5, which prompted a brief grounding of the aircraft type earlier this winter. Bolts appeared to be missing on the plane when it left Boeing's factory, a preliminary investigation found. United was contracted to receive 43 Boeing 737 Max 8 and 34 Max 9 models this year, but expects to get 37 and 19 of them, respectively, according to a company filing. It also had contracted deliveries of 80 Max 10s in 2024, the largest model in the bestselling Max family, but expects none of them this year. The plane hasn't yet been certified yet by the Federal Aviation Administration and is years behind schedule. United's CEO, Scott Kirby, in January said the carrier is making a fleet plan without the Max 10. \"As you know, United has hundreds of new planes on order and while we remain on a path to be the fastest growing airline in the industry, we just won't grow as fast as we thought we would in 2024 due to continued delays at Boeing,\" Champion and Limacher said Thursday. \"For example, we had contractual deliveries for 80 MAX 10s this year alone – but those aircraft aren't even certified yet and it's impossible to know when they will arrive.\" Other U.S. carriers have slowed pilot growth this year following a hiring spree in the past few years, after encouraging staff to take early retirement when demand slumped in the pandemic. A shortage of aviators along with slow aircraft deliveries from both Boeing and Airbus as they faced supply chain constraints have helped drive up airfares. American Airlines hired about 2,000 pilots last year and expects to add around 1,300 this year, CEO Robert Isom said at an investor presentation in New York on Monday. \"That's slowing down a little bit, but ... we have a considerable number of retirements,\" he said. \"We will be hiring for the foreseeable future at levels like that.\" Delta Air Lines is halving its pilot hiring this year after bringing on a record 2,400 in 2023, and Southwest Airlines will pause pilot hiring after a new-hire class this month, a spokesman said. Some carriers like Spirit Airlines have stopped pilot hiring altogether to slow their growth and reduce costs .",

            "text": "United Airlines is planning to launch flights to Marrakesh, Morocco, and Medellin, Colombia, and ramp up its service to Asia, in the carrier's latest bet that consumers will continue to shell out for trips abroad. The flights from United's Newark, New Jersey, hub to Marrakesh are scheduled to begin Oct. 24 using a Boeing 767-300ER. The carrier's Houston-to-Medellin flight is slated to start Oct. 27, on Boeing 737s, it said Thursday. The airline is also starting year-round service to Cebu, Philippines, from Tokyo's Narita Airport. \"Our play here with these three cities is premium leisure,\" Patrick Quayle, United's senior vice president of network planning and alliances, told CNBC. \"We see strong business [class] demand, and there's a strong correlation with people buying in biz class and Premium Select with the length of haul.\" U.S. airlines have increased their international service coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic, and revenue growth from trips abroad has outpaced domestic sales. United's international revenue grew 18% in the last four months of 2023, while sales from domestic tickets grew less than 7%. United also said it will offer four weekly flights between Shanghai and Los Angeles starting Aug. 29. It's also adding a second daily flight between Los Angeles and Hong Kong, and starting Oct. 25, will have second daily flights between San Francisco and Seoul, South Korea, and between Newark and Porto, Portugal.

            "title": "NTSB chair criticizes Boeing for lack of cooperation in 737 Max 9 probe ",
            "text": "The head of the National Transportation Safety Board on Wednesday criticized Boeing for failing to provide some key records and other information sought in its ongoing investigation into the Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 mid-air cabin door emergency. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said investigators have sought the names of the 25 people who work on door plugs at a Boeing facility in Renton, Washington, but have not received them from Boeing. \"It is absurd that two months later we don't have it,\" Homendy said at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing. Boeing said on Wednesday that it had initially provided the NTSB with some of the names of Boeing employees, including door specialists it believed would have relevant information. \"We have now provided the full list of individuals on the 737 door team, in response to a recent request,\" the planemaker said, adding, \"if the door plug removal was undocumented there would be no documentation to share. We will continue to cooperate fully and transparently with the NTSB's investigation.\" Earlier on Wednesday, Homendy said she was frustrated. \"It's not for lack of trying,\" she said, adding that the information being sought includes the precise shift that worked on the improperly installed door plug in September. The agency also seeks documentation related to opening and closing of the door plug and removal of key bolts that were missing. Homendy said the NTSB has requested documentation related to the door plug \"numerous times over the past few months.\" Separately, she told Reuters the NTSB plans to hold a multiple-day investigative hearing into the Max 9, likely in late summer, which will include testimony from Boeing personnel and fuselage manufacturer Spirit AeroSystems. Homendy confirmed that inspections of all other Max 9 planes in service found no other missing bolts. The planemaker has scrambled to explain and strengthen safety procedures since the January mid-air incident that led to the FAA grounding the Max 9 for several weeks. The company has been the subject of increased scrutiny from regulators and big air carriers concerned about the quality of jet production. Homendy said investigators began interviews at Boeing's Renton plant on Sunday and that they will continue all week. At present, the NTSB does not know which employees removed the bolts and failed to reinstall them, she said. \"The NTSB needs to interview the employees,\" she said. \"We are not about blame at the NTSB. This is the only way we ensure safety is to find out what happened, what was done, what was not done, what policies are in place.\" Homendy said she was not suggesting any malfeasance on Boeing's part. Senator Ted Cruz, the top Republican on the Commerce Committee, called it \"utterly unacceptable\" that the NTSB was not receiving full cooperation from Boeing. Homendy also confirmed that the Max 9 door plug had moved during prior flights, citing markings on the door. There were 154 prior flights by the Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 before the Jan. 5 flight. \"There were very small movements until it eventually came out,\" Homendy said, adding that testing showed \"you could see a bit of a gap towards the end\" but that it was not clear how noticeable it was. The Federal Aviation Administration this week said its 737 Max production audit into Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems found multiple instances where the companies allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements. The FAA has given Boeing 90 days to come up with a quality improvement plan.",

            "title": "Etihad Airways signals possible IPO after 2023 revenue rebound",
            "text": "Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways is gearing up for a potential initial public offering after increasing revenue in 2023 on the back of a 40% boost in passenger numbers. Asked about a possible listing, Etihad Airways Group CEO Antonoaldo Neves told CNBC on Tuesday, \"I'm working to be ready, whenever it's the time.\" Talk of an IPO has been swirling after it was reported that ADQ, the Abu Dhabi-based investment company that owns Etihad Airways, was in discussions with banks about going public as soon as this year. \"It's not for me to confirm the shareholder decisions,\" Neves said, while also signaling efforts to prepare the airline. \"It's our obligation to be ready to IPO the company whenever the shareholder believes it is the right time… and this is good, even if you don't do it.\" If it materializes, an IPO would enable Etihad to tap capital markets to fund future growth and expansion plans. It would also make it the first major Gulf carrier to become publicly traded, after years of speculation surrounding the listing of Dubai-based rival Emirates. \"We're working very hard, so that our governance is top notch… so that profitability is at the level that the shareholder can decide to IPO or not to IPO,\" Neves said, adding that \"management are putting a lot of effort in place so that the company can be compared to any other company that is listed.\" Since joining the airline in 2022, Neves has limited losses and invested in the customer experience after Etihad's ownership transfer to ADQ during the Covid-19 pandemic. The investment company has already launched a number of high-profile IPOs in recent years, including Abu Dhabi Ports and Pure Health . ADQ declined to comment about possible listing plans. Neves has previously led cost cutting and fleet upgrades at Portuguese national airline TAP and brought Azul Airlines public in New York in 2017. Etihad's CFO Raffael Quintas also served as CFO of TAP and as corporate treasurer at Azul. A listing would mark a significant step for Etihad and regional capital markets, but remains a hefty hurdle. Going public would subject the airline to stricter financial reporting and disclosure requirements, additional compliance costs and market pressure surrounding performance targets. Improving transparency Etihad on Wednesday reported it achieved an operating profit of $394 million in 2023, driven by a surge in passenger numbers to 14 million last year. The company launched 15 destinations and added 14 new aircrafts in the period, on the back of ongoing recovery in post-Covid-19 demand. Total revenue was $5.5 billion in 2023, up from $5 billion in the previous year. Net profit was just $143 million. While the figure is modest compared to industry giants , Neves said he was optimistic about Etihad's ability to expand margins and profitability, despite a challenging geopolitical backdrop and higher cost environment. The airline expects revenue growth of 25-30% this year and is targeting between $100 to $150 million in cost cuts, but didn't offer guidance on profit estimates. \"I think we can do better,\" Neves said. Boeing Concerns Neves also sought to reassure the flying public about Etihad's Boeing fleet after a door blowout on a Boeing 737-Max 9 aircraft. He said Etihad does not fly the aircraft in question, but it is a significant Boeing 787 wide-body customer \"We really trust the 787. It's a safe plane. It's an amazing machine. It's one of the best machines flying today. The safety record is good. The operating standards are good. We're very confident about the 787 program,\" Neves said. He nevertheless expressed concern that the situation at Boeing could exacerbate delays and supply chain issues that could impact the airline. \"You cannot delay planes… and that goes for Airbus as well,\" Neves said. \"Delays after delays after delays - we live today in a world where an aircraft has become a scarce resource … The only way tickets are going to go down is if we have more aircraft, so that will deploy more capacity.\" He added, \"The reality is there is untapped demand in the market.\"",

The FAA also said it found \"non-compliance issues in Boeing's manufacturing process control, parts handling and storage, and product control.\" The agency released a summary of its findings to the companies but did not make that public because it is part of an ongoing investigation, it said. Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems, which makes the fuselage for the MAX, did not immediately comment. The audit was prompted by a Jan. 5 mid-air emergency involving a new Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 that lost a door plug at 16,000 feet (4,877 meters). The FAA previously barred Boeing from expanding 737 production. Last week, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said Boeing must develop a comprehensive plan to address \"systemic quality-control issues\" within 90 days following an all-day meeting with CEO Dave Calhoun. \"Boeing must commit to real and profound improvements,\" Whitaker said last week. \"We are going to hold them accountable every step of the way, with mutually understood milestones and expectations.\" Calhoun said in a statement last week that Boeing's leadership team was \"totally committed\" to addressing FAA concerns and developing the plan. Boeing has scrambled to explain and strengthen safety procedures since the mid-air incident that led to the FAA grounding the MAX 9 for several weeks in January. Whitaker said Boeing's plan must incorporate results of the FAA production-line audit and findings from an expert review panel report released last week. Boeing last month abruptly removed Ed Clark, the head of its 737 MAX program, as part of a management shakeup. The door panel that flew off the MAX 9 appeared to be missing four key bolts, according to a preliminary report last month from the U.S. National Safety Transportation Board.",

            "text": "American Airlines said Monday that 80% of its revenue this year will come from loyalty program members and passengers who buy more expensive tickets, up from a 70% share in 2017. American and other carriers have poured billions of dollars into new cabins, lounges and onboard upgrades to cater to high-spending travelers. American's rival, Delta Air Lines , has repeatedly said that growth in premium revenue, which it considers tickets for extra legroom seats and higher-end cabins, has become a bigger share of its overall sales and is growing faster than ticket sales in the coach cabin. American earlier Monday said that it was ordering 260 new Boeing , Airbus and Embraer planes to revamp its fleet and that it would retrofit older Airbus planes to increase the size of their first-class cabins . American's revenue forecast is part of its first investor day in more than six years. It considers \"premium content\" tickets that cost more than the cheapest offering. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline said it expects to grow pretax margins in the coming years and chip away at its debt load. The carrier is in the process of renegotiating its credit card agreements with its partners, Citi and Barclays. Airlines make billions of dollars a year by selling frequent flyer miles to banks for their co-brand cards or other loyalty credit cards. American and other airlines have changed their loyalty programs to reward customers based on how much they spend instead of just how much, and how far, they fly. Over the years they have required higher spending to reach elite status. Vasu Raja, American's chief commercial officer, said Monday that a renegotiation of the contracts would increase revenue for American. \"If you if you were to ask any of our card partners, they have very few cards, if any, in their portfolio that are exhibiting the kind growth in spend per active account and total acquisition growth as well as what ours has done,\" Raja said during the investor day presentation. The carrier declined on Monday to provide profit or revenue forecasts for the first quarter or full year. Analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv, are projecting 2024 earnings per share of $2.56 and revenue of $54.97 billion. American shares fell more than 5% on Monday.

            "text": "American Airlines said Monday it is ordering 260 new narrow-body jets, including dozens of Boeing's long-delayed 737 Max 10. The order includes 85 of Boeing's 737 Max 10 planes and 85 of the Airbus A321neo, aircraft it says will help it upgauge on domestic and short-haul international routes. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline is also ordering 90 Embraer E175 planes. American's order is a vote of confidence for Boeing, which is struggling with a series of production flaws and certifications of new planes that have taken years longer than originally expected. Scott Kirby, CEO of rival carrier United Airlines , said earlier this year that his airline has been weighing fleet plans without its Max 10s because of the delays. American's CFO Devon May said the airline has additional Airbus options for new aircraft as well as financial protections with Boeing, and the ability to take already-certified models if the Max 10 certification is further delayed. \"We don't in any way want to be harmed financially through any of these aircraft orders,\" May told reporters on Monday. May said American currently expects the Max 10 deliveries to start in 2028. He noted the Max 10, the largest of the Max family, wouldn't have lie-flat seats, but would be configured like some of the airline's A321neo aircraft, with about around 190 seats and about 20 first-class seats up front. American said it would also convert orders for 30 Boeing 737 Max 8 planes, a model that is already a staple of its fleet, into the larger 737 Max 10s. The order includes purchase options for another 193 planes from the three manufacturers. Boeing is facing additional scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration after a door plug blew out midair during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. That flight was operated on a Boeing 737 Max 9. American is planning to grow its first class on some of its narrow-body planes, the carrier also said Monday alongside its first investor day in more than six years. Starting in 2025, it will retrofit its older Airbus A319 and A320 planes to increase the number of first-class seats from eight to 12 and 12 to 16, respectively. The airline is planning to retire its fleet of 50-seat, single-class regional jets in favor of the two-class planes, with in-seat power and satellite Wi-Fi by the end of the decade. The planes will be operated by American's wholly-owned regional airlines. The aircraft orders are included in American's previous capital expenditure targets. Airlines have been grappling with high demand for first class and other premium seats as more customers rack up points with credit cards and appear willing to shell out for more space on board. American said on Monday that it expects about 80% of its revenue this year to come from \"premium content,\" meaning products beyond the cheapest tickets, and its loyalty program, up from a 70% share in 2017.

            "title": "Startup backed by Tesla investor says preorders for its $300,000 futuristic flying car have reached 2,850",
            "text": "BARCELONA, Spain — Alef Aeronautics, a flying car firm backed by high-profile venture capitalist Tim Draper, says it has reached 2,850 preorders for its futuristic electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle. Alef Aeronautics, which is based in San Mateo, California, said preorder numbers recently hit a fresh record after previously reporting 2,500 preorders for its two-seater flying car, the Alef Model A. Customers can access preorders for the Model A online, and to preorder, you have to put down a $150 deposit for the vehicle. Customers can pull the deposit at any time if they want to, so they're not locked in. Alef is planning to charge customers $300,000 for the Model A when it becomes commercially available — so on 2,850 preorders, that would give it a combined order value of more than $850 million to date. \"As of today we have a little bit more than 2,850 preorders with deposits down, which makes it the bestselling aircraft in history, more than Boeing, Airbus, Joby Aviation and most of the eVTOLs [electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles] combined,\" Alef's CEO, Jim Dukhovny, told CNBC. At a price of $300,000, Alef is asking its prospective customers to part with a lot of cash. Dukhovny insists the higher price tag is needed as Alef is still a startup and isn't making any serious money yet. Alef is separately working on a four-person sedan, though, the Model Z, which is scheduled for launch by 2035 at a price of $35,000, matching that of cheaper-priced electric vehicles. Alef is one of several startups attempting to make flying cars a reality. Others include U.S. company Joby Aviation and Lilium, the Germany-based air taxi startup. Last year, South Korean telecom firm SK Telecom told CNBC it plans to launch a flying taxi service in partnership with Joby Aviation in 2025. Alef is backed by the likes of early Tesla investor Tim Draper who has also invested in Elon Musk's space exploration firm SpaceX. Musk has previously been a notable skeptic of flying cars, having said he doesn't think they're a good fix for road traffic. \"If somebody doesn't maintain their flying car, it could drop a hubcap and guillotine you,\" Musk said in a 2017 Bloomberg interview, when asked about the topic. \"Your anxiety level will not decrease as a result of things that weigh a lot buzzing around your head.\" How does Alef's car work? Most of the players on the market currently are building models that resemble a jet and come with wings attached to the sides, or big helicopter-like rotors. What Alef is going for is a much more different style of vehicle. The company's Model A car, which it showed off at the Mobile World Congress as a half-size model, resembles an actual car with a mesh shell protecting rotors on the inside that allow air to flow through the vehicle. Dukhovny calls Alef's vehicle the \"first flying car in history.\" He says it's the first because, rather than the massive drone-like designs we've seen in vehicles from the likes of Lilium and Joby Aviation, Alef's looks like an actual car. \"I know that people have claimed the first flying car,\" Dukhovny said. \"But we always had the idea that it has to be a car, a physical car, a regular car, as you can see it's an eVTOL, an electric car. a regular car, drive, park, look, everything as a car, and a vertical takeoff.\" Alef's car is mainly designed to be driven on the road, but will be able to take to the skies, too. To drive on the road, the car uses four small engines in each of the wheels, and will drive similar to a normal electric car. It has eight propellers in the front and back of the car, which spin independently at different speeds to allow it to fly in any direction. The Alef Model A has a cruise speed of 110 mph while in the air, while on the road it is limited to between 25 and 35 mph. Once it lifts off, the Alef Model A can then turn onto its side while the cockpit swivels so that the driver can continue facing forward and the car practically becomes a biplane with the long sides of the vehicles serving as the top and bottom \"wings.\" Targeting 2025 launch The Alef Model A, which weighs 850 pounds, also qualifies as an ultralight vehicle, meaning it comes under the same legal classification as small electric vehicles like golf carts. Dukhovny says that should make it easier for the car to pass key regulatory approvals to get the green light to launch flights in 2025. \"If everything goes right, we plan to, and if we have enough funding, if the law is at least not going to be worse, it's going to be existing as it is, we plan to start production of the first one by the end of 2025.\" Last year, the Federal Aviation Administration granted Alef a special airworthiness certificate, allowing for limited purposes that include exhibition, research and development of its flying car. Alef still needs to get further approval to pave the way for consumer flights. However, Dukhovny concedes that, despite the company's high preorder number, it's not going to be able to match that demand straight away. \"It's crazy how to produce 2,850 vehicles,\" Alef's CEO said. \"We're going to start slow. And when people think that's a million of those that are going to fly over San Francisco or Barcelona, that's not going to happen. It's going to be very slow — one, and then more, and then more,\" he added. Correction: Last year, the Federal Aviation Administration granted Alef a special airworthiness certificate. An earlier version misstated the name of the agency. The headline of this story has also been updated to correct the investors behind the firm.

            "text": "Malaysia is pushing for a renewed search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, the transport minister said on Sunday, as the 10th anniversary of its disappearance in one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries approaches. Flight MH370, a Boeing 777 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew, vanished en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014. Malaysian investigators initially did not rule out the possibility that the aircraft had been deliberately taken off course, and debris, some confirmed and some believed to be from the aircraft, has washed up along the coast of Africa and on islands in the Indian Ocean. Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke said U.S. seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity had been invited to discuss its latest search proposal after two previous failed attempts. \"The Malaysian government is committed to the search (for MH370) and the search must go on,\" Loke said at a remembrance event on Sunday. Malaysia engaged Ocean Infinity in 2018 to search the southern Indian Ocean, offering to pay up to $70 million if it found the plane. Malaysia, China and Australia earlier had ended a fruitless two-year, A$200 million ($130.46 million) underwater hunt in January 2017. Loke said Malaysia would talk to Australia about cooperation in resuming the search once Ocean Infinity's proposal is approved by Malaysia's cabinet. V.P.R. Nathan, whose wife Anne Daisy was onboard the flight, said Ocean Infinity's proposal, which includes a \"no find, no fee\" option, was welcome. \"We want the search to carry on but we also have to be realistic. We cannot expect the government to spend billions (on the search),\" Nathan said. Jiang Hui, a Chinese national whose mother was a passenger on MH370, called on Malaysia to provide relatives with the latest information it receives. \"As long as there is communication, we can avoid misunderstanding,\" said Jiang, who is among family members who filed a lawsuit in China demanding compensation over the plane's disappearance. A Beijing court began compensation hearings in November. More than 150 Chinese passengers were on the flight, with relatives demanding compensation from Malaysia Airlines, Boeing, aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce and the Allianz insurance group among others.",

            "title": "Airlines Avelo and Breeze, three years after their pandemic debut, prepare for a profitable year",
            "text": "In the nearly four years since the Covid-19 pandemic upended air travel, the largest U.S. airlines have returned to profitability. The CEOs of two upstart airlines that launched in the middle of the pandemic say they're about to join them. Avelo and Breeze Airways, two low-cost carriers that debuted in 2021 when U.S. air travel demand was more than 30% below pre-pandemic levels, have both grown their operations rapidly. They've launched dozens of new routes across the country, and their founders say their strategy of linking cities where there's less competition from large carriers is paying off. Think Los Angeles' Hollywood Burbank Airport, rather than Los Angeles International, or Islip, Long Island, over New York City. \"When you have Goliaths, and you're just David, it's really hard,\" said Avelo Airlines CEO Andrew Levy. Delta, American, United and Southwest together control about three-quarters of the U.S. market, according to Cirium data. Avelo says it flew 2.3 million customers in 2023, and that its planes were more than 80% full on average. Breeze flew more than 2.8 million travelers last year, and its flights were 77% full, according to the company. The carriers are still tiny. For comparison, Southwest Airlines, the largest domestic carrier, flew more than 137 million passengers last year . Yet, Avelo reported its first profitable quarter in the last three months of 2023, and a company spokesperson said the airline will likely turn an annual profit in 2024. It brought in revenue of $265 million for the full year 2023, up 74% from the prior year. Levy said he had expected the airline to turn a profit sooner, but high fuel costs during a period of broad inflation and Russia's invasion of Ukraine two years ago pushed back the timeline. Breeze is also on track for its first profitable year in 2024, said CEO David Neeleman. It typically takes two to four years from launch for airlines to turn a profit, said Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry consulting firm. Avelo and Breeze each faced additional challenges that have weighed on the entire industry, including a jump in oil prices, supply chain snarls and shortages of pilots and air traffic controllers. \"The fact that the airlines are both still operating is a credit to [Levy's and Neeleman's] visions, their leadership, but also the dedication of their employees,\" Harteveldt said. Skipping hubs Both airlines have staked a claim in the low-cost carrier segment, which also includes Frontier and Allegiant , which offer base fares, add-ons and secondary airport flights. Avelo flies to about 50 destinations and operates out of six bases including Connecticut's Tweed-New Haven Airport and Delaware's Wilmington Airport. Many of its destinations are from the Northeast to popular vacation destinations in Florida and South Carolina, but it also serves destinations in California and other western states in the U.S. The carrier moved beyond the continental U.S. in 2023 when it launched service to Puerto Rico and will likely expand to international destinations this year, Levy said. Breeze, which Neeleman founded after also starting JetBlue Airways and Brazilian carrier Azul , mostly eschews major hubs and flies out of about 50 airports such as New York's Westchester County Airport and Akron-Canton Airport in Ohio. It flies to standard vacation destinations, but also offers cross-country flights from cities such as Hartford, Connecticut or Charleston, South Carolina, to destinations including Las Vegas and Los Angeles. It hopes to launch international service by 2025. Avelo and Breeze have both continued to announce new routes and destinations this year. Avelo had 11 routes shortly after launching in the summer of 2021 and now has about 75, while Breeze flew about 16 routes that summer and is currently selling roughly 180. Breeze and Avelo sell base fares — some as low as double digits — and charge fees for checked luggage and advanced seat assignments, upcharges that have become common not just among budget airlines, but most large carriers, too. Breeze's lowest-fare option allows travelers to bring on only a personal item, but the airline also sells first class seats and extra legroom options with more amenities. Neither airline's base fare includes a carry-on bag. Operational costs Offering low airfares has made industry-wide cost increases all the more daunting for Avelo and Breeze. The nationwide shortage of pilots following the pandemic and rising labor costs , for example, have posed a challenge. Large airlines, which can offer pilots big salaries, have hired away pilots from smaller carriers in recent years to staff up after the pandemic. \"What you really want to watch with pilots is attrition. … We had an attrition rate that was higher than we liked, and now it's where we want it,\" said Neeleman. The carrier has many first officers who are poised to be upgraded to captain, helping alleviate the shortage, he added. Airlines have also struggled with late deliveries of aircraft and difficulties getting thousands of replacement parts. Avelo has faced delays in delivery of its used Boeing 737 aircraft that it leases, CEO Levy said. The company currently has 16 planes in its fleet and has five on order. \"The whole aviation supply chain system has been mucked up since Covid. And it still is not quite back to what it was,\" Levy said. Breeze said last month that it will exercise options on 10 more Airbus A220 aircraft. The company will exclusively fly the A220 for its commercial service by the end of 2024. It currently flies 22 A220s and will have 32 in operation by the end of 2024, according to Neeleman. Neeleman said Breeze is aiming to be profitable before it decides whether to file for an initial public offering or another option. Avelo also hopes to achieve sustained levels of profitability before an IPO. Levy said Avelo's focus is \"on getting to a point where the company is IPO ready,\" and that he has no interest in selling the company. Some airlines, particularly low-cost carriers, have in recent years looked to merges to chip away at the dominance of the big four carriers. JetBlue and Spirit announced plans to combine in July 2022 in a deal that would have created the fifth-largest airline in the U.S., though a federal judge blocked that merger in January. Those airlines have appealed that ruling. Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines plan to combine, though they'll continue to operate the brands as distinct carriers. Both Levy and Neeleman said there is room for multiple players in the low-cost carrier space. \"The more competition we have in the U.S. airline industry, the better it is for the traveling public,\" Atmosphere Research Group's Harteveldt said. — CNBC's Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.

The State Department said from 2013 through 2017 three Chinese employees at Boeing facilities in China downloaded technical data involving programs including the F-18, F-15 and F-22 fighter jets, the E-3 airborne warning and control system, the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter and the AGM84E cruise missile. Boeing said there were additional unauthorized downloads of technical data at Boeing and partner facilities in 18 countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Morocco, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, Taiwan, Ukraine and the United Kingdom from 2013 to 2018. The administrative settlement covers unauthorized exports of technical data and resolves 199 violations of the Arms Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the State Department said. The State Department said the settlement \"highlights the importance of exporting defense articles only pursuant to appropriate authorization\" and followed \"an extensive compliance review\" by the government. Boeing said it was \"committed to our trade controls obligations, and we look forward to working with the State Department under the agreement.\" The company added it was committed to continuous improvement of its trade controls compliance program. Boeing also engaged in some unauthorized exports of defense material and technical data related to defense programs to a number of countries including Israel, Turkey and Lebanon, the State Department said. Boeing voluntarily disclosed the violations, which mostly occurred before 2020, and the government documents did not allege disclosure of classified material. The department said Boeing cooperated and \"has incorporated numerous improvements to its compliance program since the conduct at issue.\" The settlement includes a three-year consent agreement and $51 million civil penalty, of which $24 million will be suspended by the State Department so Boeing can use the funds for remedial compliance measures to strengthen its compliance program. For at least two years, Boeing will engage an external special compliance officer to oversee the agreement, which will also require two external audits, the State Department added.",

Bolts needed to secure the unused door panel on the nearly new plane appeared to be missing , a preliminary investigation of Flight 1282 found earlier this month. The door plug was removed and reinstalled at Boeing's Renton, Washington, 737 Max factory. It was the latest and most serious of a series of production problems on Boeing's bestselling aircraft. \"Boeing must commit to real and profound improvements,\" FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a release, a day after he met with Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun and company safety managers. \"Making foundational change will require a sustained effort from Boeing's leadership, and we are going to hold them accountable every step of the way, with mutually understood milestones and expectations.\" Boeing in a statement said it would prepare a \"comprehensive action plan with measurable criteria\" and that its leadership team is \"totally committed to meeting this challenge.\" The FAA is in the middle of an audit of Boeing's 737 production lines. The agency last month said it would halt Boeing's planned ramp-up of 737 Max planes until the regulator is satisfied with the company's quality control systems. On Monday, an expert panel's report on Boeing found a \"disconnect\" between the manufacturer's senior management and employees on safety culture. The report was required by Congress after two crashes in 2018 and 2019 of Boeing 737 Max planes, which killed everyone on board the flights. The FAA said Wednesday that it expects Boeing's plan to include findings from the report and its audit, which it is scheduled to complete in the next few weeks. Boeing recently started conducting periodic work pauses at its factory to discuss safety and other production issues with workers. \"By virtue of our quality stand-downs, the FAA audit findings and the recent expert review panel report, we have a clear picture of what needs to be done,\" Boeing said in its statement.

            "text": "An expert panel reviewing Boeing 's safety management processes has found a \"disconnect\" between the planemaker's senior management and employees on safety culture and raised other concerns. The panel's report released on Monday was directed by U.S. Congress after two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people. It criticized Boeing's safety culture on a number of fronts and found \"a lack of awareness of safety-related metrics at all levels of the organization.\" It also cited an \"inadequate and confusing implementation of the components of a positive safety culture.\" The expert panel was appointed by the Federal Aviation Administration in early 2023. The panel cited \"gaps in Boeing's safety journey\" and referenced serious quality issues that have been become public since 2023. Last month, a door panel of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 jet blew off mid-flight, which prompted the FAA to temporarily ground the U.S. Max 9 fleet and raised serious questions about Boeing's quality control. The agency has barred Boeing from increasing its current Max production rate. The recent issues \"amplified the expert panel's concerns that the safety-related messages or behaviors are not being implemented across the entire Boeing population,\" the report said. The report said that within six months Boeing should review the recommendations \"and develop an action plan.\" Boeing said on Monday it appreciated the panel's work. \"We've taken important steps to foster a safety culture that empowers and encourages all employees to share their voice. But there is more work to do,\" the company said. \"We will carefully review the panel's assessment and learn from their findings, as we continue our comprehensive efforts to improve our safety and quality programs.\" The company's safety culture has faced criticism for years from lawmakers and others. \"The American flying public and Boeing line workers deserve a culture of leadership at Boeing that puts safety ahead of profits,\" Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said last month. The FAA, which is conducting a safety audit of Boeing after the Jan. 5 Max 9 incident, said it will \"immediately begin a thorough review of the report and determine next steps regarding the recommendations as appropriate. We will continue to hold Boeing to the highest standard of safety and will work to ensure the company comprehensively addresses these recommendations.\" The FAA has also faced prior criticism for not doing more to insulate its employees from pressure from Boeing. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun is set to meet with FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker on Tuesday to discuss his recent visit to Boeing's 737 factory in Washington, sources told Reuters. Boeing shares were up 0.3% at $201.52 on Monday afternoon.",
