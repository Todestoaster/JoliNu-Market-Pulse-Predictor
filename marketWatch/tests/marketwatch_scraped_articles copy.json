            "text": "In a big year for elections, India is literally the biggest, with nearly a billion people registered to vote. Narendra Modi, who has boosted foreign investment, is favored to clinch a third term as prime minister. While the conclusion might seem foregone, the elections, which kick off Friday, raise a fundamental question about the future of one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing nations. Can the next government deliver the economic reforms needed to fulfill Wall Street\u2019s ambitious projections and keep foreign investment flowing into the country?India\u2019s 44-day polling process will culminate in June and is designed to access voters in every corner. Unlike the U.S. system, where people directly vote for president, Indian voters will elect members for the parliament, who then form a government and appoint a prime minister for a five-year term.\u00a0 This year\u2019s election already has been marred by arrests of high-profile opposition figures and the seizure by India\u2019s election commission of $560 million worth of drugs, liquor, and freebies, aimed at swaying voters. Adding to the spectacle is \n        Tesla \n      CEO Elon Musk\u2019s coming visit to India this month, enhancing Modi\u2019s image as a leader who gets global capital. Consider: Chip maker \n        Micron Technology,\n       which is building an up-to-$825 million assembly and test facility in Modi\u2019s home state, Gujarat. \n        Apple\n       is making more iPhones in India. \n        Boeing\n       opened its first India distribution center. American retail investors funneled record amounts into Indian exchange-traded funds last year, supporting the country\u2019s businesses. Modi wants to do more. His Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s (BJP) fresh 76-page election manifesto\u2014titled \u201cModi ki Guarantee\u201d\u2014 doubles down on the country\u2019s strong growth over the past decade and pledges to elevate India to the third-largest economy. Improving overwhelmed Indian infrastructure\u2014including building new highways and bullet train routes, and expanding internet connectivity\u2014are major agenda items. For all the optimism, there\u2019s a risk of a future with \u201cjobless growth,\u201d where the economy expands but high unemployment remains or even worsens. In much of India, it\u2019s common to see young men loitering around without a purpose. The country, which houses the world\u2019s largest number of poor people, has been criticized for a K-shaped recovery where the rich have gotten richer after Covid-19 and inequality has widened.  At least three recent independent surveys have shown young college graduates are struggling. Nearly three out of every 10 graduates are unemployed, according to a March report by the\u00a0International Labor Organization.  \u201cWe are being overly complicit when we say this [India\u2019s growth] is great,\u201d India\u2019s former central bank head, Raghuram Rajan, said at a conference this week. There\u2019s a growing young workforce, but \u201cwe are losing the demographic dividend because we are not giving those guys jobs,\u201d he added. What can Modi do? More foreign investment could improve the labor market, but gains will be limited unless India can increase the quality of its education and produce more college graduates with the skills needed for employment. Companies like the Indian tech giant \n        Infosys\n       say they spend thousands of dollars to train each student they hire.\u00a0 Economic reforms are one way India can deliver; cleaning up autocracy could be other. The 2As\u2014\n        Adani Enterprises,\n       housed in Modi\u2019s home state, and Ambani\u2019s\u00a0\n        Reliance Industries\n      \u2014have tentacles in oil to metals to telecom industries. The two companies, along with three other giants, command 18% of the country\u2019s nonfinancial assets. The stocks are in the \n        iShares MSCI India\n       ETF, the most heavily traded India vehicle, and economists fret that their dominance leaves less room for others, feeds inflation and pose a \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d problem. \u201cIt has implications for, I would say, who in the end controls the entire investment capital of the country, and whether private investments can grow in a competitive manner, rather than remaining a bit stymied,\u201d Viral Acharya, an economics professor at New York University, told Barron\u2019s.\u00a0 How economic power gets divvied up is anybody\u2019s guess. Gautam Adani, who has had longstanding ties with Modi, is building a $2 billion airport in Navi Mumbai. It features a large lotus design, India\u2019s national flower but also a BJP symbol. In the past two election cycles, the two conglomerate stocks saw a big rally fueled by expectation of Modi\u2019s win.  Modi\u2019s pictures are splayed across billboards in India. Songs titled \u201cFir Modi Ko Le Aao\u201d (\u201cBring Back Modi Again\u201d) play up his influence. He plays virtual-reality games with young gamers. His slogans have become hashtags.\u00a0 Modi\u2019s prominence makes India\u2019s growth story vulnerable if the BJP fails to secure a term, making elections a key risk to monitor in the short term. \u201cIt will be healthy for India\u2019s government, eventually, if power alternates again, perhaps,\u201d said Andrei Stetsenko, who manages hedge fund Farley Capital\u2019s India strategy. But that\u2019s not a do or die, he added. \u201cThere\u2019s been a mind-set shift\u201d among the typical Indian corporate manager, driver, and farmer who see continued reform\u2014and that\u2019s key.

            "text": "\n\u201cPerceived income and wealth inequalities can be traced back to the way corporations pay wages and salaries, rewarding a narrow group of shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks.\u201d\n Why are young Americans so skeptical about capitalism? In a recent (2022) Pew Research\u00a0poll, only 40% of 18-to-29 year-olds expressed a positive attitude towards capitalism, and a greater number were positive towards socialism. This doesn\u2019t make any sense on rational grounds. Capitalism is the economic system that has raised levels of well-being for billions of people across the globe over hundreds of years, in contrast to all the other systems that have been tried. From life expectancy to access to education to air and water cleanliness, as well as income levels, the world is getting better as a result of capitalism. The skepticism is not just irrational, it\u2019s dangerous. Capitalism is at the core of Western civilization and its values. It\u2019s fundamental to our legal, political and social structures, and loss of faith in capitalism can portend a significant social erosion. What went wrong? How did capitalism get such a bad name? Upon deeper analysis of the criticisms of capitalism, we can trace them back to the behavior of one of the prime protagonists of the system: corporations. Perceived income and wealth inequalities can be traced back to the way corporations pay wages and salaries, while rewarding a narrow group of shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks.  Managers make themselves part of the disproportionate rewards system with stock grants and awards, perceived as becoming part of the insider trading cartel. Profit maximization can be perceived as exploitation of labor. Environmental degradation stems from corporations\u2019 uses of resources and production of waste.\u00a0 None of this is inherently bad. The use of natural resources to create capital and jobs, pay wages and salaries, while drawing on debt and equity financing to invest today in tomorrow\u2019s innovations are at the heart of the capitalist system. Profit is the signal from the marketplace that corporations are using society\u2019s resources well. \n\u201cCorporate management are perceived as having turned away from customers.\u201d\n But the deeper problem is that corporate management are perceived as having turned away from customers. The primary purpose of corporations, when they were introduced as a great capitalist innovation in the 19th century, was to create value for customers and to engage the creative human capital of the workforce in doing so. They ushered in the era of customer capitalism. Households received the gifts of extended hours of family time as a result of affordable illumination, and greater productivity and less drudgery as a result of new machines. Health, safety, and nutrition were all improved, along with transportation and education. Producers were able to equip factories with better production methods, increasing output and lowering prices for their end-users.  But over time, customer capitalism morphed into corporate capitalism, marked by a shift from the outward, customer focused perspective of the entrepreneur-owners of the early corporations to the internalized orientation of the modern management bureaucracies. There were two major components within this trend. First was the shift to management-as-control, where creativity in value creation for customers \u2014 an exploratory, uncertain activity \u2014-was made subservient to efficiency, setting and making planning goals, and \u201cno surprises\u201d. The second shift was to the primacy of the financial sector, resulting in the pursuit of short-term quarterly earnings targets, and the use of free cash flow for stock buybacks and dividends rather than investment in R&D and future but uncertain innovation.  \n\u201cBy giving themselves stock awards and stock options, management became self-dealing.\u201d\n By giving themselves stock awards and stock options, management became self-dealing. Economics professor William Lazonick has\u00a0documented\u00a0the number of instances of the leading Fortune 500 companies spending more than 100% of their net income on stock buybacks and dividends, i.e. rewarding management and shareholders at the expense of investment in R&D and future innovation for customers. We can easily observe examples of the shift from external to internal orientation and the damage it does to capitalism. For example, it was\u00a0revealed\u00a0in 2017 that Wells Fargo \n        WFC,\n        +0.79%\n       had created 3.5 million fake accounts in customers\u2019 names without their permission. This was a result of internal managerial pressure for cross-selling and the pursuit of employee bonuses at the expense of the customer. More recently, Alphabet\u2019s \n        GOOGL,\n        +10.01%\ndisastrous launch of Google Gemini AI \u2014 which lost the trust of users by inappropriately displaying Black-complected images of iconically white historical figures like George Washington \u2014 was attributed to\u00a0the power of the internal DEI team\u00a0and its rules over the engineers seeking to serve customers by providing the most useful response to their queries. The business models of Big Pharma companies  emphasize the search for blockbuster drugs (i.e., those that can generate revenues of over $1 billion annually) over accessibility and affordability for patients. There is some hope that this pattern can be superseded. Some new digital-age leaders, for example, Amazon.com \n        AMZN,\n        +3.26%,\n       have a business model that connects directly to customers, giving a greater incentive for customer value creation and a real-time feedback flow of information to make them more informed and responsive. These corporations have explored new, flatter structures, adopting the network model over hierarchy, and they are enthusiastically investing in new capital in the form of server farms and data centers and large language models that promise new value creation in the future. The capital is substantial but not fixed like the steel plants and paper mills of the 20th century. We can expect a lot more flexibility and adaptation. Will digital-age progress convince 18-29 year olds to love capitalism again? There\u2019s a good chance of it, although it\u2019s not assured. The digital giants have not got rid of all bureaucracy, and the part that remains, especially in HR, retains all the strangling control instincts of the old ones, especially in DEI, ESG and similar areas. A related problem is the entanglement with government, in areas like surveillance technology, censorship and cybersecurity. And there is still plenty of perceived self-dealing in the form of wealth and power concentration. Nevertheless, there is the potential for the return of the purpose-driven entrepreneurial mindset: serve customers well, with an engaged and well-rewarded workforce, and reap the rewards of the marketplace as a consequence rather than maximizing profit as a reason for being. The 18-to-29 year-olds can embrace that.

            "text": "By Paul Hannon Restrictive borrowing costs are weighing on services prices and U.K. inflation may be lower than previously expected, Bank of England Deputy Gov. David Ramsden said Friday. Ramsden was one of eight rate setters who voted to leave the BOE's key interest rate at a 16-year high in March. But comments in a speech delivered in Washington, D.C. suggest he may soon consider a vote to lower borrowing costs. The BOE has highlighted services prices as a key worry, since they could reflect rapid wage growth and drive a rebound in inflation as energy prices level off. However, Ramsden said there are now signs that services prices are also starting to cool. \"The restrictive stance of policy and the more symmetric unwinding of second-round effects are also reducing the more persistent components of inflation such as services inflation,\" he said on the sidelines of meetings at the International Monetary Fund. Ramsden said the risks to the BOE's inflation forecast from developments within the U.K. are now \"tilted to the downside,\" and consumer prices may rise at around the BOE's target rate of 2% into 2025, rather than accelerate to 3% as the central bank expected. Ramsden said that could prompt a change of policy. \"I will continue to take a watchful and responsive approach to my policy decisions,\" he said. \"Watchful, in terms of assessing the evidence as it accumulates, and responsive in terms of the stance of monetary policy warranted by the evidence.\" Ramsden also noted that the U.K. now has an inflation rate that is close to those of its peers, having lagged last year. \"The U.K. looks like less of an outlier in terms of recent inflation performance and more of a laggard,\" he said. \"And one that is catching up fast.\" Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com Alphabet shares surge after Google\u2019s parent posts better-than-expected earnings and announces its first cash dividend, Microsoft posts 31% quarterly growth in Azure cloud-computing revenue, and Exxon Mobil\u2019s earnings miss estimates.

            "text": "Tech earnings can still come to the stock market\u2019s rescue but the early signs are far from encouraging. Netflix, \n        Taiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingCo.\n       and Dutch chip equipment maker\n        ASML\n       have done nothing to improve the mood with their earnings in recent days. TSMC, the world\u2019s largest chip maker, cut its growth forecast for the broader semiconductor industry Thursday, putting the sector under more pressure. ASML, whose machines are essential for manufacturing chips, reported new orders that fell short of expectations Wednesday. Netflix looks unlikely to play the role of savior as its revenue outlook disappointed investors despite strong subscriber growth. Its plan to stop reporting subscriber numbers, a metric popular on Wall Street, will not help with visibility. So, the S&P 500 is currently on a five-day losing streak, its worst run since October last year. A sixth day of losses is a possibility, particularly amid rising tensions in the Middle East after Israel retaliated against Iran overnight, although early Friday there had yet to be official confirmation. But there\u2019s still hope for a tech-led market rebound. It lies with everybody\u2019s favorite market catalyst\u2014artificial intelligence. As badly as the market reacted to TSMC earnings, the company signaled strong demand for its AI chips. It\u2019s non-AI semiconductors, such as for autos and smartphones, that are letting the side down. AI and whether it can offset struggles in other areas of the tech sector may come to define this earnings season and determine whether the rally restarts. Next week could be key as several of the biggest AI players post earnings, including Microsoft and Alphabet. Meta, which released a new version of its AI chatbot Thursday, will also release results.  Anything connected to AI seems to generate increasingly lofty expectations, which Big Tech must overcome to get the rally back on track. \u2014Callum Keown Markets were reacting early Friday after Israel struck back at Iran, heightening tension in the Middle East. Israel aimed attacks at sites in central Iran where there is a drone factory, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. While there haven\u2019t been any public statements providing official confirmation, CNN reported that unnamed U.S. officials acknowledged the incident. What\u2019s Next: Much remained unclear about the extent or the impact of the Israeli action, The Journal reported. It added that the direct exchange of blows risks taking the conflict that began with militant group Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 attack on Israel to a dangerous new level. The worry is that it could embroil the U.S. and Gulf states in a regional conflagration that they have worked hard to prevent. \u2014Brian Swint, Callum Keown, Patrick O\u2019Donnell, Rupert Steiner \nNetflix\n       reported better-than-expected financial results and strong subscriber growth for its first quarter, boosted by original content and a password-sharing crackdown. But the streaming provider warned that it would soon stop providing quarterly membership data and average revenue generated per-member, the data investors watch most closely. What\u2019s Next: Netflix projects second-quarter revenue of $9.49 billion, up 16%, slightly below consensus, and better-than-consensus profit of $4.68 a share. Although it didn\u2019t provide detailed subscriber guidance, it said net adds would be down from the first quarter because of seasonal factors. \u2014Eric J. Savitz and Janet H. Cho \nMeta Platforms\n       is raising the profile of its artificial intelligence products, rolling out a free website version of its Meta AI chatbot upgraded with its latest large-language model and integrating the chatbot in the search functions of its social media apps Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. What\u2019s Next: Connor Hayes, vice president of product for Generative AI, told Barron\u2019s that Meta has partnerships with both Google and Bing to handle real-time queries through Meta AI on the stand-alone services and inside the company\u2019s apps, for questions such as live sports scores and stock quotes. \u2014Janet H. Cho and Eric J. Savitz More Federal Reserve officials are delivering the message that there\u2019s no rush to move on interest rates, joining those who don\u2019t see a rate cut until later this year. New York Fed President John Williams and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic indicated they were comfortable being patient.  What\u2019s Next: The Atlanta Fed\u2019s market probability tracker is implying a 3.6% probability of a quarter-point rate increase in June. The tracker shows there\u2019s a 63% probability of rates staying the same. The CME\u2019s FedWatch tool puts a sliver of probability\u20141.4%\u2014on a June rate increase. \u2014Liz Moyer Just as the spring housing market was starting to look promising, the winds changed. Mortgage rates have started climbing again for the first time this year, while sales of previously owned homes dropped more than expected in March from the previous month, and average home prices are still rising. What\u2019s Next: D.R. Horton and other home builders expect to benefit from demand for new construction because of a lack of existing homes available for sale.

            "text": "By David Winning SYDNEY--Woodside Energy said weaker output and lower realized prices for its oil and natural gas drove a 12% drop in sales revenue in its latest quarter. Woodside reported revenue of US$2.97 billion in the three months through March, down from US$3.36 billion in the final quarter of 2023. The company's oil and natural gas fetched an average price of US$63 per barrel of oil equivalent in the quarter, down 5%. Production fell by 7% to 44.9 million BOE, reflecting lower output at its Bass Strait, Pyrenees and Pluto assets. Still, the Perth-based company is poised for a new source of oil output in coming months as it nears completion of the Sangomar project in Senegal. On Friday, Woodside said Sangomar is 96% complete, with commissioning of the floating production storage and offloading unit underway ahead of first production in the middle of this year. Sangomar is one of several growth projects that Woodside is advancing as it seeks to keep production high. The Scarborough natural-gas project offshore Australia, which Woodside is developing in partnership with Japanese investors, is currently 62% complete. \"We remain on target for first LNG cargo in 2026,\" said Chief Executive Meg O'Neill. Woodside reaffirmed forecasts for annual output of between 185 million and 195 million barrels of equivalent.

            "text": "\nAlaska Air\u2019s\n       start to the year has been far from smooth but the turbulence may be easing. Alaska reported Thursday a first-quarter per-share loss of 92 cents. Wall Street was looking for a loss of $1.05. The results, however, were impacted significantly by \n        Boeing.\n It was always going to be a difficult quarter after a door panel blew off an Alaska Airlines \n        Boeing\n       737 MAX 9 plane midflight in early January. As the U.S. airline most exposed to the MAX 9\u2014accounting for 20% of its total fleet\u2014Alaska was canceling up to 150 flights a day during the temporary grounding of the aircraft that followed the incident. It had a pretty good quarter given the circumstances. Boeing gave the airline $162 million in compensation for financial damages. Alaska said it would have reported a profit of 3 cents a share for the first quarter\u2014its best first quarter since 2019 if the MAX grounding had not had the impact it did.  Alaska Air stock closed up 4% on Thursday at $44.44, while the \n        S&P 500\n       and \n        Nasdaq Composite\n       fell 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively.  The cash provided by Boeing was partly designed to offset lost operating profit. The payment wasn\u2019t booked in the profit and loss statement though. It showed up on the balance sheet.  Instead of treating the $162 million as income, the company treated it as a \u201creturn of capital,\u201d explained accounting expert Robert Willens. The choice lowers the value of Alaska\u2019s aircraft a little, making future depreciation expenses a little lower. That means the award is essentially spread out over time, he said. Willens would have preferred if Alaska just recognized it as earnings. The impact on company cash, of course, is unchanged.  Alaska said it has enhanced its oversight program at the Boeing production facility increasing the monitoring of the quality of its aircraft through the manufacturing process. It also expects capacity to rise between 5% and 7% in the second quarter, compared with the previous year. The company, and investors, will now want to move on from the episode. Upbeat second-quarter guidance may help in that regard. The carrier said it expects earnings of between $2.20 and $2.40 per share in the June quarter. That\u2019s better than the $2.12 estimated by analysts surveyed by FactSet and points to strong travel demand for the summer season. The Federal Aviation Administration briefly grounded all Alaska Airlines flights nationwide Wednesday following an issue due to an update to the system that calculates weight and balance. While inconvenient for travelers, it won\u2019t materially impact earnings given it only caused residual delays.  The bigger picture is a brighter one for the airline sector, which was buoyed by \n        United Airlines\n      \u2019 strong guidance Wednesday. Alaska shares rose 4.7% on Wednesday.

            "text": "Alaska Air Group\u2019s stock rallied toward an eight-month high Thursday, after the regional airline posted a narrower-than-expected first-quarter loss and revenue that beat analyst estimates, and affirmed its strong relationship with plane maker Boeing Co. The company \n        ALK,\n        -1.64%\n       acknowledged the impact on its performance of Flight 1282 on Jan. 5, when a window blew out on a flight from Oregon to Alaska, forcing pilots to make an emergency landing, as the Associated Press reported. That led to the grounding of its Boeing 737-9 Max fleet, which continued into February.  Alaska Air has received $162 million in initial cash compensation from Boeing Co. \n        BA,\n        +0.43%\n       to address the financial damage caused by the blowout, which was found to be caused by loose bolts. Chief Executive Ben Minicucci said on the post-earnings call with analysts said the compensation it received from Boeing was a \u201cstrong reflection\u201d of importance of the longstanding relationship the companies have. \u201cWe remain committed partners, but we will hold Boeing to the highest bar for quality out of the factory,\u201d Minicucci said, according to an AlphaSense transcript. \u201cAnd to that end, we have enhanced our in-person overweight of our 737 production line and are regularly engaging with Boeing leadership on quality and schedule.\u201d Basically, trust but verify. On Wednesday, the airline briefly grounded all of its flights after it \u201cexperienced an issue while performing an upgrade to the system that calculates our weight and balance.\u201d See: Alaska Airlines briefly grounds all flights due to technical issue The stock ascended 4.6% in afternoon trading, putting it on track for the highest close since Aug. 15, 2023. It was headed for the biggest one-day, post-earnings gain it at least the past five years, according to available FactSet data. The carrier reported a loss of $116 million for the quarter, or $1.05 a share, after a loss of $142 million, or $1.11 a share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding one-time items, it reported a loss of 92 cents a share, narrower than the loss of $1.05 consensus forecast by FactSet analysts. Revenue rose 2% to $2.232 billion from $2.196 billion, also better than the $2.177 billion FactSet consensus.  \u201cDespite significant challenges to start the year our results have far exceeded initial expectations,\u201d Chief Executive Ben Minicucci said in a statement. For the second quarter, Alaska Air is expecting EPS to range from $2.20 to $2.40, which compares with a FactSet consensus of $2.12. It expects capacity measured by available seat miles to rise 5% to 7% and for economic fuel cost a gallon to range from $3.00 to $3.20. For the full year, it expects EPS of $3.25 to $5.25, while FactSet is expecting EPS of $4.26. It expects full-year capacity to fall about 3% and for fuel cost a gallon to range from $3.25 to $5.25. Separately, CEO Minicucci noted that during the latest quarter, it received from the U.S. Department of Justice a second request for information regarding its proposed $1.9 billion purchase of Hawaiian Holdings Inc. \n        HA,\n        +0.12%,\n       the parent of Hawaiian Airlines. Because of \u201csubstantial volume\u201d of information involved, he said the company granted the DOJ an additional 60 days to review its response to the request. \u201cWe still believe strongly\u00a0in the pro-consumer and pro-competitive merits of this deal and are excited by the opportunities this will unlock for Alaska, both domestically and internationally,\u201d Minicucci said. The stock has climbed 14.4% in the year to date, while the U.S. Global Jets ETF \n        JETS\n       has gained 7.3% and the S&P 500 index \n        SPX\n       has gained tacked on 5.1%. Alphabet shares surge after Google\u2019s parent posts better-than-expected earnings and announces its first cash dividend, Microsoft posts 31% quarterly growth in Azure cloud-computing revenue, and Exxon Mobil\u2019s earnings miss estimates.

            "text": "\nGE Aerospace\n       stock has been just fine during the recent market slide. It could be the strength of management or the outlook for commercial aerospace. Or it could just be Wall Street. Fine is an understatement. Coming into Thursday trading, GE Aero stock has been the best stock in the entire \n        S&P 500\n       for April, according to Bloomberg, up about 11% month to date. The index was down about 4%. It isn\u2019t the aerospace industry. \n        Boeing\n       stock have had a terrible April, dropping almost 12%. \n        Boeing,\n       however, is having issues with manufacturing quality and production speed. The move in other aerospace supplier stocks, besides GE, including \n        RTX,\nTransDigm Group,\n       and \n        Honeywell International\n       averaged out to down a little.  Wall Street looks like it deserves most of the credit for GE\u2019s relative strength. On April 2, General Electric split into GE Aerospace, which kept the \u201cGE\u201d stock symbol, and \n        GE Vernova,\n       which trades under the ticker \u201cGEV.\u201d Since then Wall Street has been redoing earnings estimates and price targets for both companies. The updated target prices for GE Areo have been better than expected. Before the spin, GE stock was trading at about $175 which included about $35 a share for \n        GE Vernova,\n       based on where that stock was trading headed into the spin.  (Shares of soon-to-be spun-off companies often trade in a \u201cwhen issued\u201d basis before spins are completed so investors get an early sense of valuation.) That left about $140 for GE Aerospace stock. Updated price targets range from about $150 to $190 and are averaging out to about $172, according to FactSet. The most recent four updates from this week average out to about $170. GE Aero stock, as a result, has moved up about $15 from pre-spin levels, settling at $155, or about 11% below the updated price targets. That\u2019s a similar gain implied by the average price targets for stocks in the S&P 500. At $155, GE Aero stock is trading for about 29 times estimated 2025 earnings per share. The S&P 500 trades for closer to 19 times. Wall Street is putting a premium multiple on GE Aero price targets because they see margins improving and demand for commercial air travel growing in the future. The post-spin valuation reset looks like it\u2019s just about done. That means future gains in GE Aero stock will depend on how good the demand for air travel is and how fast management can improve margins.  GE Aero stock was up 1.1%  to $ 157.39, while the S&P 500 was up 0.5% and the \n        Nasdaq Composite\n       had risen 0.4%.

            "title": "Santos 1Q Oil, Natural Gas Output Falls 7% -- Update",
            "text": "By David Winning SYDNEY--Santos said its oil and natural gas production fell by 7% in its latest quarter, after its operations were disrupted by bad weather and planned maintenance. Santos reported production of 21.8 million barrels of oil equivalent in the three months through March, down from 23.4 million BOE in the final three months of 2023. Sales volumes were 8% lower at 23.2 million BOE, contributing to a 6% drop in sales revenue to US$1.4 billion. Still, Santos said its free cash flow from operations totaled US$692 million in the quarter and its gearing was below 20% when operating leases were excluded. \"It positions us well to fund shareholder returns, backfill and sustain our existing business, complete our major projects and grow our Santos Energy Solutions business,\" said Chief Executive Kevin Gallagher. Those major projects include the Barossa natural-gas field off Australia's northern coast, which is advancing again after being held up by a legal challenge. In September 2022, a judge threw out a regulator's approval of Santos's environmental plan to drill for natural gas there after an indigenous leader on the remote islands argued Santos didn't properly consult his clan on its impact. Santos's revised environmental plan was accepted by the regulator in December, and drilling has restarted at the project, which is now almost 71% complete. Santos said its Pikka oil development in Alaska is 47% complete and on track for first production in 2026. \"Barossa and Pikka are world-class projects that will be transformative for Santos and set the company up with long term, stable cash flows for the next 10-15 years at least,\" Gallagher said. Santos said its liquefied natural gas fetched an average price of US$12.68 per million British thermal units in its fiscal first quarter, slightly higher than the final three months of 2023. However, its domestic gas price fell to US$5.95 per gigajoule, from US$6.02/GJ in the previous quarter. Shares in Santos have recovered from a recent low in February that was reached not long after takeover talks with Woodside Energy collapsed. The energy industry has tailwinds of tensions in the Middle East, a major oil production hub, and a recovering global economy. Santos reiterated on Thursday that it expects to produce between 84 million and 90 million barrels of oil equivalent this year, down from 91.7 million BOE in 2023. It has also forecast sales volumes of 87 million-93 million BOE, compared with 96.4 million BOE a year ago.

            "text": "Congressional hearings on Wednesday detailed some of the manufacturing, quality, and cultural problems facing \n        Boeing.\n The company and its stock have been under immense pressure this year. On Jan. 5, an emergency door plug blew out of a 737 MAX 9 jet operated by \n        Alaska Air,\n       leading to more government oversight. After the incident, a Federal Aviation Administration audit found some manufacturing quality issues that the company is working to fix. Here are some details from the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing, along with additional context.   Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at Boeing and whistleblower, testified about Boeing\u2019s safety culture. In particular, he is concerned about Boeing\u2019s treatment of gaps in 787 fuselages.  His testimony covers the newest issue for Boeing, raising concerns that 787 fuselages are at risk of fatigue and cracking. \u201cRight now, from what I\u2019ve seen, the airplanes are not being built per [specification],\u201d said Salehpour.  Boeing says hundreds of 787 planes have been inspected and tested with no issues found.  Ed Pierson, a former manager at Boeing\u2019s 737 factory in Renton, Washington, testified about the 737 MAX. He originally raised issues about Boeing\u2019s manufacturing in 2019. He contended Wednesday that the 737 MAX is still unsafe. He described Boeing\u2019s manufacturing process as \u201cchaotic.\u201d  Two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 resulted in the worldwide grounding of the MAX jet between March 2019 and November 2020. \u00a0Both were faulty flight control software Joe Jacobsen, another former Boeing and FAA employee who retired from the FAA in 2021, reviewed the two 737 MAX crashes. Shawn Pruchnicki, an Ohio State University professor and airline pilot, testified about safety cultures, adding that the number of incidents at Boeing was alarming.  Initial comments from the company focused on the 787.  \u201cIn 13 years of service, the global 787 fleet has safely transported more than 850 million passengers on more than 4.2 million flights. A 787 can safely operate for at least 30 years before needing expanded airframe maintenance routines,\u201d said Boeing in an emailed statement. \u201dExtensive and rigorous testing of the fuselage and heavy maintenance checks of nearly 700 in-service airplanes to date have found zero evidence of airframe fatigue.\u201d  No 787 jet has ever been lost in an accident. Boeing also expressed confidence in its 777. The company didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment about the MAX. Production has been ramped down amid more FAA oversight after the emergency door plug blew out of a 737 MAX 9 jet operated by Alaska Air earlier this year. About its culture, Boeing said it took recent criticism to heart and is working to improve its culture. \u201cSince January 2024, there has\u00a0been a more than 500% increase in employee reports through our \u2018Speak Up\u2019 portal compared to 2023, which signals progress toward a robust reporting culture that is not fearful of retaliation,\u201d added the company. \u201cMore than\u00a040,000\u00a0employees have participated in \u00a0[quality meetings] at\u00a0more than a dozen Boeing\u00a0sites,\u00a0providing\u00a0tens of thousands\u00a0of ideas for improving our production system and culture.\u201d  Boeing stock closed 0.2% lower Wednesday around $170. The \n        S&P 500\n       and \n        Nasdaq Composite\n       fell 0.6% and 1.2%, respectively.  Wednesday\u2019s drop brings year-to-date losses to about 35%.

Alaska said it expected to receive additional compensation in future quarters, and details of the deal were also kept confidential. United reported first-quarter earnings after the bell Tuesday, sparking a stock rally that boosted shares by more than 17% on Wednesday.  The airline reported better-than-expected first-quarter results and forecast a second-quarter profit above Wall Street\u2019s expectations, thanks to strong demand and a rebound in business travel. United also said it expects to bring fewer aircraft into its fleet this year, due to the Max 9\u2019s groundings and production limits. United said it has reworked its orders on other aircraft, and has agreements in place to lease a few dozen more jets from Airbus.   Southwest Airlines Co.\u2019s stock tumbled 9% Thursday after the airline posted a wider-than-expected first-quarter loss and revenue that lagged estimates.

The moves need some context, though\u2014United stock has fallen 15% so far in April through Tuesday\u2019s close, American has dropped 13%, and Delta just 2.8%. United managed to defy its Boeing-related problems to post a narrower-than-expected loss in the first three months of the year. Its adjusted loss of 15 cents per share beat expectations of a 54 cents per-share loss, according to FactSet.\u00a0 The carrier would have reported a quarterly profit without the $200 million impact from the temporary grounding of Boeing\u2019s MAX 9 aircraft in January. But it\u2019s the reasons behind the stronger-than-expected quarter that offer hope to the broader sector. Firstly, demand is still very strong\u2014United said domestic passenger revenue rose 6.6% compared with the first quarter in 2023, while international revenue jumped 16%. United\u2019s results also provided further evidence of an accelerating rebound in corporate travel. The airline said business demand increased by a double-digit percentage in the quarter compared with prepandemic levels. Delta said last week that its managed corporate sales rose 14% year over year in the first quarter, led by the tech, consumer services, and financial services sectors in particular. On top of that, Delta said a recent survey showed that 90% of companies expect their travel volumes to increase or stay the same in the June quarter and beyond. It\u2019s no surprise then that the Big 3 network airlines\u2014United, Delta, and American\u2014were among the best performers early Wednesday, given their exposure to international and corporate demand. The domestic demand signals also helped those without as large an international presence. \n        JetBlue Airways\n       rose 3.9% and \n        Alaska Air\n       was up 3.5%. TD Cowen analyst Helane Becker said United\u2019s results were \u201cencouraging,\u201d as she maintained a Buy rating on the stock and a $55 price target. \u201cThis is the airline\u2019s first time generating an adjusted operating profit in the March quarter since 2019. The fact that the MAX 9 grounding caused a $200 million headwind makes it even more impressive,\u201d she added. Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said the carrier\u2019s first-quarter results, and stronger-than-expected second-quarter guidance \u201clikely drives greater confidence\u201d in the company\u2019s full-year outlook for earnings of between $9 and $11 per share.

            "text": "It turns out two weeks is a long time in the world of central banks. Earlier this month Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confidently said that recent strong economic data had not altered the overall picture of inflation moving down toward the 2% target. But it seems that has now changed as Powell bemoaned the lack of further progress in the Fed\u2019s inflation battle this year in a speech Tuesday. If higher inflation persists, rates will stay higher for longer, he suggested. The market is now pricing in September for the first rate cut, with the probability of a June cut at just 14%, according to CME\u2019s FedWatch tool. In between those two Powell speeches there hasn\u2019t been a huge amount of data\u2014one consumer price index reading, a producer price index print, a jobs report, and a retail sales update. It underscores just how quickly things can change. With that in mind, a June cut isn\u2019t completely off the table\u2014the data just need to soften, and rapidly.  The stock market was remarkably sanguine following Powell\u2019s remarks given the circumstances, and the \n        Dow\n       even closed higher for the day. Maybe the market saw it coming\u2014enough Fed officials have dropped hints at cuts being delayed. Or perhaps a further three-month wait, if it ends up being that, simply isn\u2019t the end of the world. Or it\u2019s possible the timing of rate cuts doesn\u2019t matter that much to the heavily weighted stocks, such as \n        Microsoft,\nAlphabet\n       and \n        Nvidia.\n       The S&P 500 equal-weight index fell 0.5% Tuesday, compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 0.2% drop\u2014346 of the stocks listed on the index closed lower. A strong economy can help those bigger names, a boost that\u2019s likely to be highlighted later in earnings season. \u2014Callum Keown Stronger-than-expected first-quarter inflation and labor-market data have made Federal Reserve officials less certain about when policymakers might cut interest rates this year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said it would take longer than expected to gain confidence that inflation is moving toward its 2% goal. What\u2019s Next: The Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, the Commerce Department\u2019s personal-consumption expenditures price index coming next week, is expected to show that core prices rose 2.8% in March from a year earlier, the same as in February, according to estimates by Fed economists. \u2014Janet H. Cho and Reshma Kapadia \nASML Holding,\n       the semiconductor-manufacturing equipment supplier that\u2019s Europe\u2019s third biggest company by market value, missed expectations for orders in the first quarter of the year. It\u2019s a sign that its chip industry customers are being cautious with their equipment purchases despite the race to build up national chip-making industries. What\u2019s Next: ASML will be hoping that its order book will begin to be boosted by a wave of new chip-manufacturing plants backed by government incentives in the U.S. and elsewhere. \u2014Adam Clark \nUnited Airlines\n       beat first-quarter expectations and forecast better-than-expected second-quarter earnings amid strong travel demand. It is navigating through Boeing\u2019s safety problems on some aircraft, which have caused production challenges and have cost United approximately $200 million. Without that, United would have reported a quarterly profit. What\u2019s Next: United forecasts second-quarter earnings of $3.75 to $4.25 a share, higher than analysts\u2019 estimates of $3.73 a share. It also maintained its full-year adjusted earnings forecast of $9 to $11 a share. \u2014Callum Keown and Janet H. Cho \nUnitedHealth Group\u2019s\n       better-than-expected earnings report appeared to breathe new life into the beleaguered managed-care sector. The company maintained its 2024 adjusted earnings forecast despite a mess of a quarter after a hack of the payments tools operated by its subsidiary Change Healthcare led to industry chaos. What\u2019s Next: J&J expects full-year adjusted earnings of between $10.57 and $10.72 a share, and sales of between $88 billion and $88.4 billion. Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said J&J expects more medical procedures this year as seniors catch up on care that was postponed during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u2014Josh Nathan-Kazis and Janet H. Cho As retail gasoline prices edge toward a seasonal high, a new forecast for a busy Atlantic hurricane season could set expectations for a late-summer surge in energy prices. Colorado State University forecast an extremely active Atlantic hurricane season, with 23 named storms and 11 hurricanes. What\u2019s Next: GasBuddy\u2019s De Haan told MarketWatch that gasoline prices in the Mid-Atlantic including New York could rise 20 cents to 50 cents a gallon over the next few weeks, and prices in California could reach $6 a gallon. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30. \u2014Liz Moyer Dear Quentin, My mother-in-law, 75, has been married to her husband for almost 30 years.  They both have adult children from previous marriages. They are over 70 years old and for most of their marriage, they have kept separate money accounts. When they married, he moved into her home and a few years later, she added him to the deed. They still owe $52,000 on the mortgage and carry a $20,000 HELOC. They both receive Social Security, his being higher. He also receives a pension. Last year, he moved to an assisted living facility. She remains in the home, herself in poor health. She can barely make her mortgage payment as all her income goes toward the house payment and living expenses. Her husband\u2019s pension and Social Security go toward his assisted living facility. He does make the minimum payment on the HELOC. Other than that, he does not contribute to her finances. I\u2019ve advised her to sell farmland that she owns, which would pay off the mortgage and give her a financial cushion.

            "text": "\nUnited Airlines\n       has had more than its fair share of problems in recent months, but its first-quarter financial results included better-than-expected revenue and earnings.  It also forecast second-quarter earnings of $3.75 to $4.25 a share, higher than analysts\u2019 estimates, and maintained its full-year adjusted earnings-per-share forecast of $9 to $11. Shares rose more than 6.3% in late trading on Tuesday, after rising 1.1% in regular trading. United reported a net loss of $124 million, or 38 cents a share, and an adjusted net loss of $50 million, or 15 cents a share. Revenue rose nearly 10%, to $12.5 billion. Because of its exposure to Boeing\u2019s temporarily-grounded MAX 9 aircraft, United had forecast a loss of between 85 cents and 35 cents a share. Wall Street expected the airline to post an adjusted loss of 58 cents a share on revenue of $12.5 billion. United said its pretax loss of $164 million for the quarter, up $92 million from the first quarter of 2023, \u201creflect the approximately $200 million impact from the \n        Boeing\n       737 MAX 9 grounding, without which the company would have reported a quarterly profit.\u201d United\u2019s second-quarter guidance was of more interest to investors, particularly because in the comparable period last year, the airline hit record earnings of $5.03 a share. Analysts expected United to fall short of that, estimating $3.73 a share.\u00a0 Echoing what Delta Air Lines said last week after it, too, beat first-quarter earnings expectations, United reported strong travel demand. United saw a double-digit percentage increase in business demand compared with pre-pandemic, and said adjustments in domestic capacity \u201cdrove meaningful improvements in first quarter profitability.\u201d In response to Boeing\u2019s issues, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said the carrier adjusted its fleet plan to \u201cbetter reflect the reality of what the manufacturers are able to deliver.\u201d United converted some of its Boeing MAX 10 aircraft orders to Boeing MAX 9 from 2025 to 2027, and could convert more to Boeing MAX 8 or 9 \u201cas needed.\u201d United also has letters of intent with two lessors to lease 35 new \n        Airbus\n       A321neos with CFM engines in 2026 and 2027. United now expects deliveries of 61 narrowbody aircraft and five widebody aircraft in 2024. Although a \u201csmall number of aircraft\u201d expected to begin service in the second quarter will be pushed into the third quarter, United said that should have \u201cminimal impact\u201d on its capacity plans. \u201cWe\u2019ll use those planes to capitalize on an opportunity that only United has: profitably grow our mid-continent hubs and expand our highly profitable international network from our best in the industry coastal hubs,\u201d Kirby said. Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said United\u2019s revenue is likely to hold up better than most of its peers \u201cdue to outsized exposure to large corporate and international travel and faster growth in its premium offering.\u201d She has an Outperform rating on the stock with a $66 price target, implying 61% upside to Monday\u2019s closing price. United stock is up 0.6% in 2024, but it\u2019s on a bad run more recently, falling 13% since the beginning of April. The airline\u2019s full-year earnings guidance helped boost the shares in January but analysts aren\u2019t convinced, currently forecasting $9.43 a share. Recent events have put the guidance under further pressure. The Federal Aviation Administration has increased its oversight of United following a series of mishaps. United potentially faces restrictions on new routes and the use of new planes, The Wall Street Journal reported last month.\u00a0 The airline then delayed the launch of two new international routes last week amid the FAA review. Its investor day, originally scheduled for May. 1, has also been postponed.\u00a0 The sheer number of incidents has concerned regulators. An aging United Airlines Boeing 737-800 aircraft was found to have a missing external panel last month, and a United Boeing 777 lost a wheel taking off from San Francisco on March 7. Several other United flights have encountered issues\u2014including a Boeing 757 which had a damaged wing and was forced to make an emergency landing in Denver in February. The impact of Boeing\u2019s production and safety problems further complicates matters for United. The airline has asked pilots to take unpaid leave in May as aircraft delivery delays means it expects to fly fewer planes. That should allow it to reduce costs, but also highlights the extent of overstaffing and delivery problems. United said last month that it was contractually due to receive 191 planes this year but expects to only get 88\u2014the shortfall is almost all Boeing 737 MAX planes. United management will discuss first-quarter financial results during a conference call at 10:30 a.m. ET, 9:30 a.m. CT, on Wednesday. Alaska Air Group reports earnings on Thursday.

            "text": "By Ed Frankl The U.K.'s annual rate of inflation cooled to a two-and-a-half year low in March, a contrast with hotter-than-expected recent prints in the U.S. that makes it likely that the Bank of England will lower its key interest rate later this year. Consumer prices were 3.2% higher in March than the same month a year earlier, cooling from the 3.4% annual rate of inflation recorded in February, the Office for National Statistics said Wednesday. The reading, the lowest since September 2021, was marginally higher than the 3.1% expected by a consensus of economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. Offering further reassurance to policymakers at the BOE, core inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, also fell to 4.2%, from 4.5%in February. The BOE left its key rate unchanged at a 16-year high in March, but signaled that it is likely to cut later this year, while giving little guidance on the exact timing. Although the upside surprise in March slims a little the chance of interest rates being cut for the first time at its next meeting, \"as long as inflation continues to fall fast in the coming months, as we expect, the BOE may still feel comfortable cutting interest rates in June,\" Capital Economics deputy chief U.K. economist Ruth Gregory said in a note to clients. The steady decline in U.K. inflation contrasts with developments in the U.S., where March data recorded a pickup in inflation, and prices have been rising faster than expected for three straight months. That has led some market participants to dial back predictions for cuts by the Federal Reserve. While the U.S. is enjoying robust economic growth, U.K. activity remains subdued after the economy slipped into recession at the end of 2023. Most economists estimate that the U.K. returned to growth in the first quarter of this year, but they don't expect a strong recovery this year. \"The dynamics of inflation are different between Europe and the U.S.,\" said BOE Governor Andrew Bailey on Tuesday. \"There is more demand-led inflation pressure in the U.S. than we are seeing.\" Investors anticipate that the BOE will cut its key interest rate in June, with steady easing in the rest of 2024 in a bid to stimulate the economy. However, a significant divergence between the BOE and the Fed could lead to a weaker pound and a rise in prices of imported goods and services. At a confirmation hearing before lawmakers, Clare Lombardelli, the BOE's incoming deputy governor for monetary policy, said that lower interest rates are clearly \"the direction of travel\" but wouldn't comment on the exact timing of a first rate cut. However, the BOE still faces challenges in bringing inflation to the central bank's 2% target. Policymakers worry that strong wages growth will lead to a fresh series of price hikes, particularly in the labor-intensive services sector. Services inflation remains relatively strong at 6.0% in March. However, the March inflation print came after pay data showed wage growth continued to decline and the unemployment--while still low by historical standards--crept upward. Inflation has fallen from the 11.1% rate of October 2022, after energy prices skyrocketed as a result of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The BOE raised the key interest rate from 0.1% in December 2021 to the current 5.25%, the highest since 2008.

            "text": "Shares of United Airlines Holdings Inc. rallied after hours on Tuesday, after the airline reported first-quarter results and forecast a second-quarter profit that were above Wall Street\u2019s expectations, helped by strong demand and a rebound in business travel. But United \n        UAL,\n        -1.46%\n       said it expects to bring fewer aircraft into its fleet this year, after the government grounded Boeing Co.\u2019s 737 Max 9 jets and placed limits on their production. United, which predominantly flies Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.50%\n       jets, said it has reworked its orders on other aircraft, and has agreements in place to lease a few dozen more jets from Boeing\u2019s archrival \u2014 Airbus \n        EADSY,\n        +1.13%.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve adjusted our fleet plan to better reflect the reality of what the manufacturers are able to deliver,\u201d Chief Executive Scott Kirby said in United\u2019s earnings release.  Those adjustments would follow waves of travel disruptions to the airline industry since the pandemic, from the eruption of \u201crevenge travel\u201d to understaffing on flights to production issues at some of Boeing\u2019s suppliers. Fewer planes for passengers to fly on, coupled with continued demand, could push airfares higher.  United said it expected second-quarter earnings per share of $3.75 to $4.25. That was above FactSet forecasts for a per-share profit of $3.73. The company stuck with its full-year adjusted profit-per-share forecast of $9 to $11.  Shares rose 5.2% after hours on Tuesday. The stock is still down 2.1% over the past 12 months, when compared to Tuesday\u2019s closing price.  \u201cOverall, these results and guide could bring at least some relief to what we would characterize as the oversold situation in United\u2019s shares,\u201d Citi analysts said in a note on Tuesday. United issued its forecast in the wake of a several safety mishaps aboard flights \u2014 including a tire that fell off a jet and an engine fire \u2014 that triggered a government review and prompted the airline to postpone its investor day. Those issues could be an area of focus during the airline\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday morning. United on Tuesday said its first quarter would have been profitable were it not for the grounding of the Max 9 jets, which were pulled from the nation\u2019s airspace after a mid-flight door-panel blowout on one of those planes, flown by Alaska Airlines, in January. United said the groundings cost it around $200 million.  The airline reported a first-quarter net loss of $124 million, or 38 cents a share, compared with a loss of $194 million, or 59 cents a share, in the same quarter last year. Adjusted for special charges, unrealizes losses on investments and debt extinguishment costs, United lost 15 cents a share.  Revenue rose 9.7% year over year to $12.54 billion.  Still, the results topped estimates. Analysts polled by FactSet expected United to report an adjusted loss of 58 cents a share, on revenue of $12.45 billion.  \u201cThe demand environment remained strong, with a double-digit percentage increase in business demand quarter over quarter, as compared to pre-pandemic,\u201d the company said in its earnings release.  It also noted that it was able to \u201ctake advantage of a number of opportunities to adjust domestic capacity\u201d \u2014 a measure of the total amount of planes, seats and flights in its network \u2014 to drive \u201cmeaningful improvements in first-quarter profitability.\u201d United said it had converted a portion of Boeing Max 10 aircraft orders to Boeing Max 9s from 2025 through 2027, and that it maintained the right to convert more Boeing Max 10 orders into Max 8s or Max 9s as needed. The company added that it made letter-of-intent agreements with two lessors to lease 35 new Airbus A321neos.  The airline also said that following the groundings of the Max 9, it now expects 61 narrow-body aircraft and five wide-body aircraft to be delivered this year. That would be down from earlier expectations for 101 narrow-body deliveries, amid manufacturing and certification delays.  United in January said it was reconsidering its longer-term plans for the Max 10, after the groundings of the Max 9 raised questions over whether Boeing could make and deliver the planes on time.  CEO Kirby, at a conference last month, said he was encouraged by how Boeing was handling its latest crisis. But he said its problems would take years to solve.  \u201cI think they have accepted that there are larger changes that they need to make,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s probably an overused term, but they need to go slow to go fast, and I think they\u2019re doing that.\u201d  \u201cI think that means, this year, deliveries are going to be way behind what they expected, originally forecast and expected,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I am glad that that\u2019s the case. As much as I would like those deliveries, this is not a 12-month issue. This is a two-decade issue.\u201d   Southwest Airlines Co.\u2019s stock tumbled 9% Thursday after the airline posted a wider-than-expected first-quarter loss and revenue that lagged estimates.

Appearing before lawmakers at a confirmation hearing, Clare Lombardelli said an easing of monetary policy is clearly \"the direction of travel\" across Europe, but declined to comment on the exact timing of a first reduction in the BOE's key rate. Lombardelli, who will cast her first vote as a rate setter in August, said she would be alert to data on services prices and wages as signs that inflation may pick up again, while acknowledging that policy is becoming more restrictive as headline inflation eases. \"The labor market is absolutely critical,\" she said. Lombardelli will join the bank from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, where she has been chief economist. Before that, she worked for the U.K. Treasury. The BOE left its key rate unchanged at a 16-year high in March, and signaled that it is likely to cut later this year, while giving little guidance on the exact timing.

            "text": "By Joshua Kirby Unemployment ticked higher and wage growth slowed in the U.K. in the three months to February, adding to key signs that inflation is easing and making interest-rate cuts likelier in the coming months. The unemployment rate stood at 4.2% over the period, still relatively low by historical standards but higher than it has been since the three months to August last year, according to Office for National Statistics figures set out Tuesday. It is also higher than economists had expected, according to a Wall Street Journal poll that saw the rate at 4.0%. As joblessness crept higher, average regular pay growth eased to 6.0%, continuing last month's trend of slower salary increases, albeit coming in a little higher than expectations. For the three months to March, vacancies fell slightly, but remain well above the prepandemic era, the ONS said. \"We are now seeing tentative signs that the jobs market is beginning to cool,\" said Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS. The cooler jobs market will keep policymakers confident that inflation is easing sustainably, according to Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics. \"If it wasn't for the clear weakening in activity in the labor market we'd be a bit worried that the UK's disinflation process is grinding to a halt like in the U.S.,\" Dales said. \"But with employment falling sharply and the unemployment rate climbing, we suspect wage growth will continue to ease in the coming months.\" The Bank of England is expected this summer to cut its key bank rate from its current 5.25%, the highest level since 2008, as price rises steadily slow. Nevertheless, stubbornly high inflation in the U.S. could throw a spanner in the works. Prices have at the start of 2024 accelerated in the U.S. as Americans spend energetically and the country's jobs market stays tight, putting into doubt the Federal Reserve's own rate-cutting path. For the BOE, lowering policy rates before the Fed does would risk weakening the pound and driving up import prices, threatening a renewed spike in consumer prices. But the BOE could in any case choose to act ahead of the Fed, Dales said. Lower wage growth \"may allow the bank to cut interest rates in June, even if the Fed doesn't move until September,\" he said.

            "text": "Boeing is defending the integrity of the fuselages on two of its largest planes, which have come under criticism from\u00a0a whistleblower\u00a0who warns that panels on the outside of one of the planes could eventually break apart during flight. Two Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.39%\n       engineering executives went into detail Monday to describe how panels are fitted together, particularly on the 787 Dreamliner. They suggested the 787\u2019s carbon-composite skin is nearly impervious to metal fatigue that weakens conventional aluminum fuselages. Their comments during a lengthy media briefing served as both a response to news reports last week about the whistleblower\u2019s allegations and a preemptive strike before he testifies to a congressional panel on Wednesday. The whistleblower, Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour, said excessive force was applied to fit panels together on the 787 assembly line, raising the risk of fatigue or microscopic cracking in the material that could cause it break apart. The Boeing officials described how sections of a fuselage are brought together, shims are added to fill gaps, holes are drilled and cleaned, and fasteners attached to apply \u201cpull-up force\u201d that 99% of the time results in margins of .005 inches or less between panels. A gap problem was discovered in 2019 between two panels, which led to design and assembly changes, they said. Boeing conducted testing replicating 165,000 flights with no findings of fatigue in the composite structure, Steve Chisholm, Boeing\u2019s vice president of structural engineering, said. The average 787 makes 600 flights a year, he said. Chisholm said 671 Dreamliners have undergone the intensive inspections for 6-year-old planes and eight have undergone 12-year inspections with no evidence of fatigue in the composite skins. Cracks have been found on metallic parts, including a piece above where the wings join the fuselage, and Boeing issued inspection guidelines for those parts, the officials said. The 787 Dreamliner is a two-aisle plane that has often been used on international flights since its debut in 2011. The composite material makes the plane lighter, contributing to better fuel efficiency. A series of\u00a0battery fires\u00a0briefly grounded the planes. Deliveries of the aircraft have been stopped at times because of questions about fuselage panels, the use of\u00a0unapproved titanium parts\u00a0from a supplier in Italy, and flaws in a\u00a0pressure bulkhead. Microsoft and Alphabet's CEOs both called out their use of Nvidia chips in earnings calls.  Visit a quote page and your recently viewed tickers will be displayed here.",

            "text": "Investors are selling \n        Boeing\n       stock aggressively. It\u2019s hard to see where shares are going next.  Shares of the commercial aerospace giant closed at $167.82, down 1%, on Monday, while the \n        S&P 500\n       and \n        Dow Jones Industrial Average\n       fell 1.2% and 0.7%, respectively.  Rising bond yields, which signal the market\u2019s growing belief that interest rate cuts aren\u2019t coming, along with unrest in the Middle East, were responsible for a large proportion of Monday\u2019s losses.  Boeing stock has now fallen for 11 consecutive days. It\u2019s the longest streak since an 11-day streak in November 2018, according to Dow Jones Market Data.  Along with market-related factors, problems with the 737 MAX have weighed heavily on investor sentiment. An emergency door plug blowout on a 737 MAX 9 jet operated by \n        Alaska Air\n       on Jan. 5 has resulted in more regulatory oversight, slower MAX production, and falling earnings estimates from Wall Street analysts.  Shares are now below several support levels, including moving averages.  Stock support and resistance are terms technical market analysts use to determine where investors have tended to buy and sell a stock at points in the past. Oftentimes, support and resistance line up with fundamental data points such as price-to-earnings or price-to-sales ratios.  In the case of Boeing, there was some technical stock support around $170. That level also corresponded to Boeing shares trading at their lowest price-to-sales ratio relative to \n        Airbus.\n So recently, Boeing stock was about as cheap as it ever gets relative to its chief rival. The prior time that Boeing shares were that cheap on a price-to-sales basis was 2022. Now they are cheaper.  Fairlead Strategies analyst Will Tamplin sees some support for Boeing stock around $150 a share. That\u2019s still down another 10% or 11% from recent levels.  Boeing stock is in \u201csupport discovery mode,\u201d says CappThesis founder and market technician Frank Cappelleri. \u201dIn other words, we must wait to see where demand surfaces next. Once it does, that will be the new line the sand.\u201d  Sometimes market technicians can\u2019t help, except to say a stock is in new territory.  Boeing stock can\u2019t, and won\u2019t, continue to go straight down. Shares are now oversold. There is math behind the term, but it essentially means a stock has gone down a lot, quickly.  It\u2019s also a sign shares are due for a bounce.  A bounce will be a short-term trading phenomenon. The longer-term direction of the stock will depend on how Boeing\u2019s management handles the current crisis.

            "text": "Netflix\u2019s stock has been on a tear over the past year, as the streaming platform gradually adopts the traits of the thing it once upended \u2014 a regular TV station. But when it reports first-quarter results on Thursday, it will likely have a far higher bar to clear to keep the momentum going.  Along with its own shows and movies, Netflix \n        NFLX,\n        -0.74%\n       has rolled out ads. It has clamped down on password sharing. And after years of courting subscribers with a flood of new content, it has done a lot more recently to court investors, raising subscription prices and cutting spending, staff and programming, while still logging record subscriber additions.  It has also waded into one of the last remaining lifelines for basic and cable television \u2014 live sports \u2014 landing the broadcast for a boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul set for July, and WWE Raw starting next year. The results and conference call could offer early indications of viewer interest.  Investors, having factored in all of that, have sent Netflix\u2019s shares 80% higher over the past 12 months.  As the entertainment industry consolidates and tries to appease investors\u2019 demands for streaming profit growth, at least one analyst declared that Netflix had \u201cwon the streaming wars.\u201d However, it has no shortage of rivals \u2014 from the likes of Disney \n        DIS,\n        -0.45%,\n       Amazon \n        AMZN,\n        +3.36%,\n       Warner Bros. \n        WBD,\n        -1.39%\n       and Paramount \n        PARA,\n        -1.77%.\n       Like the rest of the industry, it also faces bigger questions raised by last year\u2019s strikes, including compensation for writers and actors and the role of AI in films and shows.  In a note last month, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said Netflix still had lots of levers to expand sales, profits and free cash cash flow. But he added: \u201c[W]e think it will be much harder for Netflix to impress investors in 2024 vs. 2023.\u201d  \u201cSome of the growth drivers have been fully priced in, such as the password-sharing crackdown,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think there\u2019s still some benefit from that, but it\u2019s marginal and now expected. The ad tier has significant growth remaining, and is not yet accretive. Once it is, it can expand meaningfully over time and contribute handsomely to earnings growth. We think it will reach accretion this year, and should be the main growth driver in 2025.\u201d Dan Morgan, an analyst at Synovus, said bigger questions for Netflix included how much growth it could still get out of paid sharing options and ads, how its pricing stacked up against rivals, and the outlook for the business further out.  \u201cThere is a debate among investors over the longer-term prospects for the business,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile all agree the prior outlook for net adds and margins was likely too high, most still see this as a very attractive business over time.\u201d Of the S&P 500 index companies, 44, including six in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, will report quarterly results in the week ahead, according to FactSet. Outside of Netflix and an array of financial institutions, we\u2019ll get earnings from health-insurance giant UnitedHealth Group. \n        UNH,\n        +0.47%,\n       which has been hit by higher medical costs, a cyberattack, a report of an antitrust investigation, and concerns about the government\u2019s payments to insurers that provide Medicare Advantage plans. Elsewhere, results from railroad operator CSX Corp. \n        CSX,\n        +0.35%\n       and trucking and logistics company J.B. Hunt Transport Services \n        JBHT,\n        -1.37%\n       will offer an update on the state of shipping demand. Johnson & Johnson \n        JNJ,\n        -0.29%\n       also reports.  United Airlines: After a pandemic-era crisis and the revenge travel that followed, travel demand appears to be fine. United Airlines Holdings Inc. \n        UAL,\n        -1.47%,\n       however, isn\u2019t. The airline, which reports quarterly results on Tuesday and holds its earnings call Wednesday, postponed its investor day to focus on a Federal Aviation Administration review of its safety standards, following a string of mishaps on flights in recent weeks. Amid delays in deliveries for Boeing jets, United has asked pilots to work less next month. The airline has said that it\u2019s \u201cconfident\u201d in its business. But analysts and reporters will be on the lookout for cracks in its convictions.   Lots more bank results: When JPMorgan Chase & Co. reported quarterly results on Friday, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said the consumer was still \u201cstrong,\u201d but said that geopolitical friction and \u201ca large number of persistent inflationary pressures\u201d still existed. If the nation\u2019s biggest bank is offering that kind of mixed diagnosis, what does it mean for the rest of the banking and finance sector? Markets will get more answers next week, with results due from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \n        GS,\n        +1.93%,\n       Bank of America Corp. \n        BAC,\n        +0.15%,\n       Morgan Stanley \n        MS,\n        +0.54%,\n       Discover Financial Services \n        DFS,\n        +1.64%\n       and American Express Co. \n        AXP,\n        -0.43%.\n       Those companies will report as borrowing money gets harder and some consumers show signs of falling behind on bill payments, and as the commercial real estate industry suffers due to the rise of remote work.  Dimon said there were \u201csome cracks\u201d in the subprime auto market. JPMorgan\u2019s chief financial officer said it had seen \u201cno meaningful improvement\u201d in its portfolio for office real estate, although it hadn\u2019t gotten any worse. Citigroup Inc. \n        C,\n        +1.60%,\n       meanwhile, said on Friday that a soft landing for the economy was \u201cincreasingly likely.\u201d  \u201cExpectations for these large financial institutions are relatively low, with the inverted yield curve and suppressed demand for credit weighing,\u201d Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, said in emailed commentary on Friday.  \u201cHowever,\u201d she added, \u201cwe always look to these earnings releases as canaries in a broader economic coalmine.\u201d Steve Gelsi contributed reporting.

            "text": "\n\u201cHow could Boeing\u2019s CEO walk away with a \u00a045% pay raise \u00a0after causing even more damage to the company?\u201d\n For half a century, maximizing shareholder value has been the overriding objective of corporate governance, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom. But Boeing\u2019s \n        BA,\n        +0.38%\n       disastrous performance on product and customer safety may mean that change is in the air. The crashes in\u00a02018\u00a0and\u00a02019\u00a0of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max model, in which 350 people were killed, should have served as a wake-up call. But it was not until the blowout of a side door on a recent U.S. flight that it became obvious to everyone that there is a fundamental problem with how Boeing is being run. Since then, AerCap \u2014 the world\u2019s largest aircraft-leasing company and a major customer of Boeing \u2014 has\u00a0demanded\u00a0that financial targets \u201ctake a back seat,\u201d so that the company can focus 100% \u201con quality and safety metrics.\u201d Another customer, Emirates, has\u00a0demanded\u00a0that the company\u2019s next CEO be an engineer. Boeing\u2019s largest union, the International Association of Machinists District 751, has\u00a0demanded\u00a0a board seat to \u201csave this company from itself.\u201d How did it come to this? For years, courts and academics have embraced shareholder value as the path to efficient management, as if focusing on this single goal and subjecting a company to the discipline of the market would reliably ensure top performance. Yet corporate management is far too complicated a task to be guided by the stock ticker. Every day, executives must make difficult decisions about how best to balance financial goals with product quality and safety, labor conditions, environmental impact and so forth. What shareholder value has done is turn corporations into ATM machines. Corporate bosses embraced the concept because they could partake in lucrative shareholder bonanzas through stock-option plans and extra bonuses. Perhaps not surprisingly, these cash channels are often misaligned with actual company performance. How else could Boeing\u2019s CEO walk away with a\u00a045% pay raise\u00a0after causing even more damage to the company when he failed to fix its problems after the Max crashes? Read: Boeing is paralyzed, and this failing of its executives and directors is to blame Pleasing shareholders with hefty dividends and share buybacks can all too easily undermine large business operations. But it wasn\u2019t always this way. In the early 17th century, a legal innovation, the \u201ccapital lock-in,\u201d created a basis for corporations to mobilize capital for large-scale investments by depriving investors of the opportunity to withdraw their money. With a more stable capital base, companies could borrow on a larger scale, and the market for shares became more liquid, because new investors did not have to fear that old ones would pull out. The primacy of shareholder value turned shareholders into the pilots who steer companies. But portfolio investors have little interest in concerning themselves with the details of management. Their only concern is the bottom line. They lack a \u201cfirm commitment,\u201d as economist Colin Mayer of the University of Oxford\u00a0puts it. And when these pilots\u2019 planes start to fall apart in midair, many will simply bail out and try their luck elsewhere. But firms are more than just ATM machines. They pool resources, they innovate and \u2014 perhaps most importantly \u2014 they solve problems. Contrary to the leading\u00a0theory of the firm, which views the institution as a second best to markets (as merely a \u201cnexus of contracts\u201d), firms can do things that markets cannot do. As economists Albert Hirschman and\u00a0Kenneth Arrow\u00a0demonstrated, firms have the\u00a0capacity\u00a0to repair \u2014 to mend flaws when things go wrong, to improve their operations and to find solutions to new complications. Prices may signal the need for repair, but actually doing the repair work requires much more. One must find the root cause of the problem and devise an effective and lasting fix. Stakeholders that can parachute away when things go wrong will not invest in repairs. They will choose \u201cexit\u201d over \u201cloyalty\u201d (in\u00a0Hirschman\u2019s terms); and when they use \u201cvoice,\u201d they usually do so only to vote for directors who will advance their own interests. For portfolio investors, the exit door is always kept open \u2014 if only by the company stepping in and buying back their shares. That means they are the most disloyal stakeholders of any business corporations. From their perspective, it does not even matter what goods the firm produces, except as a factor to be considered in building a well-diversified portfolio. Once they have pocketed their gains, they will get out, leaving behind an organization that has sought to please investors by cutting costs, even when that has meant losing customers and valuable employees. As with airplanes, it is easy to crash a firm, but it takes much more time, and many more resources, to rebuild it. Boeing\u2019s self-inflicted woes hold broader lessons. Once again, we see how the misguided idea of shareholder value can serve powerful financial interests while destroying what business organizations are best at. Firms excel not at blindly pursuing a single goal, but at pooling resources to solve complex problems, produce things of value and reduce costs for society. This can be profitable, but making profit an end in itself is ultimately counterproductive. The \u201cBoeing Effect\u201d ought to remind us of that.

The percentage of taxpayers who file for deadline extensions doubled in the past two decades, with 19.5 million expected to do so this tax season. Millions more get automatic extensions because they\u2019re in zones hit by hurricanes, wildfires, snowstorms, or other disasters. The IRS issued more than 30 disaster extensions in 2023, up from 19 in 2022. There are differences in extension rules for taxpayers in and out of disaster zones. All taxpayers can extend their deadline by six months by filing Form 4868 on April 15 (or April 17 for Massachusetts and Maine due to state holidays). An extension to Oct. 15 is for filing a return, not for paying taxes owed. The penalty is 5% on taxes owed for filing later than your deadline, 0.5% for underpayments, plus 8% interest compounded daily.  Source: IRS Disaster-related extensions are typically both for filing and paying taxes due, and automatically granted for taxpayers in disaster zones; there\u2019s no need to file a Form 4868. Rules vary by zone, so taxpayers should carefully read the IRS notice about their location.  Why has late filing grown?

            "text": "Wall Street loves General Electric\u2019s new look post-breakup\u2014especially GE Aerospace stock. That excitement could also boost shares of other aerospace companies.  GE finished its three-way breakup on April 2 when GE Aerospace\u2014a pure-play aerospace company\u2014and \n        GE Vernova\n      \u2014GE\u2019s power generation businesses\u2014became independent companies. \n        GE HealthCare Technologies\n       was spun in early 2023.  Adjusted for the spin, GE Aero shares are up roughly 15%\u2014not a bad early return. And Wall Street analysts are bullish and see some modest growth ahead. The 10 most current price targets average about $166 a share, a 6% gain from Friday\u2019s intraday level of roughly $156 a share. Nine of those targets are attached to Buy ratings. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&P 500 is about 55%.  Price targets can typically be read in one of two ways. They represent where analysts believe the stock will trade over the coming 12 months or the fair price to pay to earn a normal market return. The average analyst price target for \n        S&P 500\n       companies is roughly 10% above where shares trade currently. That average varies by industry, too.  GE Aerospace has fetched a surprising valuation. At $166 a share, GE Aerospace would be trading for about 31.5 times estimated 2025 earnings per share of $5.26, according to FactSet. The S&P 500 trades for about 19 times. Wall Street expects higher earnings growth for GE Aerospace than the average S&P 500 company.  Wall Street is forecasting record demand for new jets and air travel in the coming years. As \n        Boeing\n       and \n        Airbus\n       struggle to ramp up production, older planes will stay in the air for longer. That is a positive backdrop for aerospace supplier stocks generally.  GE Aerospace won\u2019t be the only company to benefit from these dynamics. Investors appear to prefer pure-play aerospace companies right now. Shares of \n        TransDigm,\n       another aerospace pure-play, trade for about 31.5 times estimated 2025 earnings. Shares of some other large aerospace franchises are priced well below the valuation GE and TransDigm fetch.  \nRTX\n       shares, for instance, trade for 16.5 times estimated 2025 earnings. Some of that discount is because of pressures on the company\u2019s profit margin stemming from quality problems with the company\u2019s Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engine. Those issues have been well documented.  \u201cI think a large part [of the problem] has been discounted in the shares already,\u201d says Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau. He rates RTX shares Buy but doesn\u2019t have a price target.  \nHoneywell,\n       which isn\u2019t a pure-play aerospace company, trades for about 18 times estimated 2025 earnings per share. Honeywell\u2019s aerospace segment is only about 35% of its total business. It also has energy, building, and automation businesses. If Honeywell Aerospace traded for GE-like levels, the rest of the business would be trading for about 11 times.  Investors can continue to favor GE Aerospace and other pure-play aerospace firms.

Published Friday, the Bernanke review is one of the first steps taken by a leading central bank to understand why it underestimated a surge in prices that began in early 2021 and dented living standards. Bernanke concluded that the BOE performed no worse than its peers in anticipating the inflation surge, and that errors were unavoidable given the size of the shocks that hit economies during the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath. \"Given the unique circumstances of recent years, unusually large forecasting errors by the Bank during that period were probably inevitable,\" Bernanke said. However, he delivered a scathing verdict on the bank's forecasting machinery, concluding that it was deprived of needed resources and judging that the baseline economic model--known as COMPASS--has significant shortcomings and should be thoroughly revamped. Bernanke said the forecasting process makes the central bank slow to recognize big changes in the economy, such as those that occurred during the pandemic. He recommended that the bank explore alternative scenarios to the most likely path for the economy, both in its forecasts and its communication with the public. This is a practice that has already been adopted by Sweden's Riskbank. \"The publication of selected alternative scenarios would help the public better understand the reasons for the policy choice,\" Bernanke said. Bernanke also recommended that policy makers should be exceptionally clear when they don't believe in the assumptions that underlie their forecasts. The Monetary Policy Committee's forecasts for growth and inflation are based on the assumption that the interest rate they set changes as investors expect. But policy makers often have a very different view of how rates should change, and that can lead to confusion. In late 2022, for example, the BOE forecast that the U.K. economy would enter a deep recession, but that assumed rates were going to rise more sharply than policy makers intended. What they were actually doing was signaling that they wouldn't raise the key rate as rapidly as investors expected, but business and consumer confidence may have been weakened by the recession call. \"The MPC should de-emphasize the central forecast based on the market rate path,\" Bernanke said. He also suggested that the MPC base its forecasts on its own expectations for interest rates, as do the Swedish and Norwegian central banks, but stopped short of making that a formal recommendation. \"That change would be highly consequential and this report recommends leaving decisions on this issue to future deliberations,\" he said. The former Fed chair was more definitive in dispatching another enduring element of the BOE's forecasting and communications process, concluding that fan charts that aim to show the probability of inflation differing from the central forecast have outlived their usefulness. \"They should be eliminated,\" he said. The BOE said it would follow Bernanke's guidance. \"This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to update our approach to forecasting, and ensure it is fit for a more uncertain world,\" said BOE Gov. Andrew Bailey. \"We are committed to taking action on all of Dr. Bernanke's recommendations.\" The U.K.'s annual rate of inflation peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. It has fallen steadily since then, to 3.4% in February. The BOE raised its key interest rate in a series of 14 steps to 5.25% in August 2023 from 0.1% in December 2021. That was its highest level since early 2008. The challenges of forecasting inflation accurately continue to bedevil central banks, including Bernanke's former employer. Policy makers at the Federal Reserve expected inflation to ease this year, opening the way for a series of rate cuts. But recent inflation readings have been hotter than expected, putting those expected cuts in question.

            "text": "By Joshua Kirby The U.K. economy continued to grow slowly in February as it looks to climb out a shallow slump, though calls will likely remain for the Bank of England to add some vigour via interest-rate cuts starting in June. Gross domestic product rose by 0.1% on month, slowing slightly from growth of 0.3% booked in January, Office for National Statistics data showed Friday. Construction output decreased over a month that saw very wet weather, while industrial output rose as the car industry stepped up production. \"The economy grew slightly in February with widespread growth across manufacturing, particularly in the car sector,\" said Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS. Barring an unlikely slump of around 1% or more in March, the U.K. looks set in the first quarter to emerge from the recession into which it sank in the latter half of 2023. The Bank of England remains nonetheless likely to start cutting interest rates at its meeting in June at it bids to stimulate economic activity. Inflation has eased more than forecast in the year to date, offering scope for the bank to lower rates. In the U.S., by contrast, a dynamic economy has complicated the task of bringing inflation down to manageable levels, casting doubt over the Federal Reserve's path of rate-cuts. Economic recovery in the U.K. might prove more energetic than the BOE currently expects, but shouldn't be so strong as to prevent inflation falling considerably further, said Paul Dales, chief U.K. economist at Capital Economics, in a note. The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates from their current heights at its meeting in June, as inflation eases rapidly. \"We're not yet at the point where we can cut interest rates, but things are moving in the right direction,\" Governor Andrew Bailey said at the bank's last meeting in March. February's sluggish growth will add to pressure on the BOE to begin cutting rates, said Richard Carter, head of fixed-interest research at Quilter Cheviot, though he noted that any decision remains dependent on further figures on inflation and wage growth. \"We have a few more weeks to go until the BOE makes its next move,\" Carter said in a note. \"While it will be keeping a watchful eye on inflation levels and labour-market data, the first rate cuts are looking increasingly on the agenda.\" Write to Joshua Kirby at joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby Tesla stock has risen for three consecutive days, after falling for seven straight.

Wall Street\u2019s expectations finally look achievable, according to BofA Global Research\u2019s Lorraine Hutchinson. She upgraded her rating on the athletic apparel maker\u2019s stock to Buy on Thursday from Neutral for the first time in several years. The analyst\u2019s new price target of $113 for the stock implies a 27% upside from the latest closing price.

Nike\u2019s stock had a tough run so far, down 16% for the year. It\u2019s among the biggest losers in the \n        Dow Jones Industrial Average,\n       falling behind only \n        Intel\n       and \n        Boeing.\n Nike has had its own set of issues. Management, last month, warned of softening sales this year as consumers from Europe to China pull back their spending. Sales were practically flat in the latest quarter compared with a year ago. Inflated inventory levels had forced the company to offer deep discounts to clear its warehouse last year, though the levels have somewhat normalized now.  Competition from brands such as \n        Deckers Outdoor\u2019s\n       Hoka\u00a0and \n        On Holding\n       over the past few years hasn\u2019t been good news for Nike, either. The upshot? Over the past two years, Wall Street analysts have lowered their projections for profit by 35% for the current fiscal year ending in May and nearly halved it for the fiscal year ending in May 2025.  Nike\u2019s stock is now relatively cheap. The stock trades at 22.7 times its next 12-months earnings per share estimate versus its own five-year average of 31.6 times.  Nike\u2019s Investor Day this fall, the first in\u00a0seven\u00a0years, and the newness and marketing around the Olympics,\u00a0are catalysts that can help the stock as well, the analyst said. Nike unveiled its newest shoes in four separate news releases this morning.  Investors are also pinning hopes on the recently announced multiyear\u00a0cost savings\u00a0plan to help boost sales.  Nike\u2019s stock was up 3% at $91.72 at midday on Thursday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3%. Nike was a Barron\u2019s stock pick in August last year, when it traded at $107.51.

            "text": "Linking the trajectory of interest rate cuts in the U.K. too tightly to the U.S. is mistaken because British inflation will be stickier, according to a Bank of England monetary policymaker. Megan Greene, a U.S. economist who is an external member of the BoE\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, said market-implied reductions in official U.K. borrowing costs have been boosted of late by hopes for easing by the Federal Reserve rather than a proper assessment of the U.K.\u2019s price pressures. Writing in the Financial Times, Greene acknowledged that news on Wednesday that U.S. consumer price inflation picked up speed again in March, meant that prior to Thursday\u2019s trading the market thought the BoE will cut rates earlier and by more than the Fed this year. However, Greene added: \u201cMacroeconomic fundamentals and inflation dynamics differ in the U.K. and U.S., and there\u2019s a greater risk of persistence in the former. The markets are moving [U.K] rate cut bets in the wrong direction.\u201d  The main way that the U.S. and U.K. economy differ is that the former has estimated potential growth of 2.2% this year while the latter \u2014 with low productivity growth and constrained labor supply \u2014 has just 1%.  \u201dThis means the U.S. can withstand more demand in the economy before it turns inflationary,\u201d said Greene. The U.K. has also suffered more from inflation shocks linked to the energy crisis following the war in Ukraine. And the cost of living crisis has translated into higher pay growth in Britain, by some metrics around 6-7% compared to 4-5.5% across the Atlantic. Sticky wage growth is an significant component of services inflation, which  is above 6% in the U.K. but below 4% in the U.S., Greene noted. \u201cMomentum in the markets has been towards pricing in later rate cuts by the Fed as economic growth remains robust,\u201d said Greene. \u201cIn my view, rate cuts in the U.K. should still be a way off as well.\u201d The yield on the 2-year gilt \n        BX:TMBMKGB-02Y\n       rose 8 basis points to 4.44%, after a 16 basis point surge on Wednesday.  The yield on the 2-year Treasury \n        BX:TMUBMUSD02Y\n       was steady after a 23 basis point surge on Wednesday.

            "text": "About the author: Jason Korman is the chief executive of Gapingvoid Culture Design Group. The latest reports about \n        Boeing\n       make this clear: Investors haven\u2019t seen the hard proof they need that the company has fixed its long-standing culture problems. Ever since a panel blew off of a Boeing 737 MAX 9 Alaska Airlines jet in January, a new wave of attention has focused on the company. The airline\u2019s inspections found many loose bolts on similar aircraft. A few weeks later, the nose wheel came off of an older Boeing jet in \n        Delta Airlines\n      \u2019 fleet before takeoff at the Atlanta airport. Though these incidents have made headlines recently, data shows that overall incident rates for Boeing are still low, and in line with other companies like Airbus.  While these incidents fortunately did not lead to casualties, they rightfully raised alarms. It was just a handful of years ago, in 2018 and 2019, that two crashes of the Boeing 737 MAX killed 346 people. Investigations at the time found problems in the company\u2019s safety culture, which in 2020 Barron\u2019s wrote was \u201cbroken.\u201d\u00a0 One of the cultural issues relates to a set of Boeing employees who are empowered to report to the Federal Aviation Administration under a program known as Organization Designation Authorization, or ODA. The FAA surveyed some of these employees in 2021. In a letter to Boeing, the FAA said Boeing\u2019s culture appeared to \u201champer\u201d these inspectors \u201cfrom communicating openly with the FAA.\u201d More than a third (35%) said the environment did not support the inspectors\u2019 independence. The company vowed to fix its culture so that everyone at Boeing feels safe speaking up about any issues they see. A new CEO, David Calhoun, was brought in to help oversee this change. Boeing\u2019s board awarded him $33 million in cash and stock last year, $10 million more than the year before. (Calhoun declined to be considered for an annual incentive payment that could have been worth $2.8 million more.)  In February of this year, the FAA released a new review by an expert panel that had been mandated by Congress. It\u2019s striking how little has changed. The new report found \u201ca disconnect between Boeing\u2019s senior management and other members of the organization on safety culture. Interviewees, including ODA unit members, also questioned whether Boeing\u2019s safety reporting systems would function in a way that ensures open communication and non-retaliation.\u201d Calhoun said in response to the report that Boeing has \u201ca clear picture of what needs to be done.\u201d He promised to develop an action plan with measurable criteria \u201cthat demonstrates the profound change\u201d the FAA wanted to see. Meanwhile, the stock has continued to decline. Since the release of the FAA review in February, it has fallen 11%, and has dropped a total of 59.6% from its all-time high in March 2019.\u00a0 And while the announcement that Boeing is replacing several leaders including Calhoun may have been aimed at reassuring investors, it shouldn\u2019t. A company can bring in new names and faces without addressing the underlying issue. A big part of the problem is that \u201cculture\u201d seems nebulous. When investors hear a company\u2019s leaders describe the kind of culture that they\u2019re building in an organization, it\u2019s natural to believe them. Shareholders don\u2019t know how to gauge whether real change is taking place. I work with companies and government agencies to create culture change, including organizations specializing in aviation. I show them that the key is to treat culture as a management system designed to embed new thinking models. These changed mindsets then lead to predictable, deliberate decision-making and new outcomes. For example, the management system makes clear what the company prioritizes most: safety or production schedule. The answer may sound obvious, but in the day to day grind, emotion can overcome logic. When a culture is clearly defined as a management system, priorities become clear at all times. So any employee can say that they need to pause or slow down because they may have spotted a problem. Managers know to reward that behavior, not punish it, because the employee is acting in accordance with the established thinking models. How can investors know whether Boeing is achieving real change? Boeing has said that Calhoun\u2019s compensation for 2024 (he plans to step down at the end of the year) will be tied to safety goals and to the \u201cdesign and deployment of an employee culture survey.\u201d But a survey on its own does not provide real insight. To determine whether things have really changed, a company needs to ensure that any survey is packed with quantitative and qualitative questions and provides guaranteed anonymity. Even more importantly, organizations also need to allow in observers over an extended period of time. The employees have to get so used to the observers being present that they let their proverbial guards down and resume normal operations. With a new culture instilled, the surveys and reports from observers will demonstrate a concrete cultural shift. My team has seen this up close in aviation through our work with the U.S. Air Force. The service has a rigid hierarchy that makes the idea of challenging a superior uncomfortable\u2014or even impossible. (Boeing hires many Air Force veterans, and likely has similar hierarchical thinking.) But once we had the chance to speak with airmen, observe behaviors, and enact culture change programs that last, we saw the beginnings of successful transformation. Boeing is a bureaucratic business with bureaucratic customers. It needs to break its well-established models of thinking and adopt new mindsets. While these incidents have made headlines recently, data shows that overall incident rates for Boeing are low, and in line with other companies like Airbus.  The company must face the reality that human errors are inevitable, and only a culture that supports speaking out can help catch and fix those errors. When shareholders demand proof that culture change is happening, they\u2019ll help Boeing finally move in the right direction.

            "text": "SpaceX is without peer in the burgeoning commercial space business. And it might just be the best company in Elon Musk\u2019s portfolio of companies\u2014even better than Tesla.  That\u2019s saying something, given \n        Tesla\n       is the most valuable car company on the planet. But SpaceX\u2019s lead over its competition is larger than Tesla\u2019s. What\u2019s more, SpaceX is growing and expanding its profitability. Tesla can\u2019t say the same right now.  SpaceX\u2019s space dominance is something to behold. Through early April, the company launched 36 rockets into orbit. The rest of the world launched 32. Its pioneering use of reusable rockets and relentless focus on improvement through iteration have left it galaxies beyond the competition. Launches are one thing. SpaceX carried roughly 80% of all the payload that reached orbit in 2023. Tesla sold almost 20% of all the battery-electric vehicles sold around the globe in 2023. Impressive, but not 80%.  That lead is a reason SpaceX, with its roughly 13,000 employees, has been valued at $180 billion in private markets. That\u2019s more than any other aerospace and defense company in the Western world, including \n        Boeing,\nRTX,\nGE Aerospace,\n       and \n        Lockheed Martin.\n       SpaceX, measured on April 10, is number one.  Despite that valuation, financial details about the company are thin. SpaceX makes money by launching things into space for others. It also has a space-based Wi-Fi business called Starlink with an estimated 2.6 million subscribers. Based on pricing for the service, Starlink is likely generating some $5 billion a year in recurring revenue.  Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas projects $13 billion in 2024 total sales for the company, up some 54% year over year. He sees sales hitting $100 billion by 2035, growing about 20% a year on average for the next decade-plus.  Wall Street\u2019s Tesla estimates don\u2019t go out that far, but growth has been slipping. Wall Street projects about 1.85 million vehicles sold in 2024, up a hair from the 1.8 million sold in 2023.  Starlink accounts for almost three-quarters of Jonas\u2019 projected 2035 revenue as he predicts it will grow from about $8 billion in 2024 to $74 billion by 2035. Launch services account for the rest.  Jonas believes SpaceX is profitable now and expects better profitability down the road. He projects a 2024 operating profit of almost $1 billion and a net income of about $700 million. By 2035, he projects an operating profit of about $36 billion and a net income of about $27 billion.  Operating margins are expected to go from about 8% to 35%. Tesla\u2019s operating profit margins are expected to be about 8% in 2024, they are going in the other direction though. Tesla earned an operating margin of almost 17% in 2022.   Jonas\u2019 profit projections leave SpaceX trading for about 6.7 times his estimated 2035 profits. There aren\u2019t many good ways to compare that to the market. But if the \n        S&P 500\n       grows earnings at its historical rate for the coming 11 years, it would be trading for roughly 7.7 times estimated 2035 earnings. On that basis, SpaceX is cheap.  Jonas\u2019 2035 Starlink projections include 45,000 satellites in orbit and 32 million subscribers. \u201cAbout 2.7 billion people do not have internet access,\u201d adds the analyst in his report.   Starlink is the financial star for SpaceX, but the launch business is doing fine. Jonas projects roughly $5 billion in sales and $500 million in operating profit for 2024, growing to $29 billion and $8 billion, respectively, by 2035.  Building and launching those satellites costs a lot of money. Jonas estimates SpaceX is spending about $6 billion a year on capital equipment and doesn\u2019t project positive free cash flow for the company in 2024. Instead, he sees a use of about $1 billion this year. Free cash flow should be positive by the end of the decade and grow to $24 billion a year by 2035.  SpaceX didn\u2019t immediately respond to Barron\u2019s request for comment about its finances.  When regular investors will get a chance to own SpaceX is an open question. CEO Elon Musk says he would consider selling shares in Starlink when the Wi-Fi business was generating predictable cash flow.  That could be now\u2014or years down the road. Don\u2019t forget, that companies typically go public to access large pools of capital. SpaceX has grown to a multibillion-dollar aerospace franchise without needing those pools to this point.  Investors may just have to wait.

            "text": "Shares of Boeing Co. kept falling toward the lowest levels seen in more than a year on Wednesday, as the aerospace giant continued to feel the heat from allegations of shoddy safety controls. \u201cJust when you thought things couldn\u2019t get any worst at Boeing, they have,\u201d is how Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard put it. The stock \n        BA,\n        +0.31%\n       slumped 2.4% in afternoon trading. It has tumbled 9.9% amid an eight-session losing streak, which would be the longest such streak since the nine-day stretch that ended Sept. 13, 2023. That put the stock on track to close at the lowest price since November 2022. The continued selloff comes after reports surfaced late Tuesday that the Federal Aviation Administration was investigating claims made by a Boeing whistleblower who said the company was taking assembly and safety shortcuts with 787 aircraft. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), chairman of the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said late Tuesday that the allegations are being examined, and requested that outgoing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun appear at a hearing scheduled for April 17. Also on Tuesday, Boeing reported the fewest quarterly aircraft deliveries in nearly three years, and well below what Wall Street was expecting. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Bert Subin said that while he expects the deliveries story to improve this year, as the problem is more about production issues than a lack of demand. However, the data doesn\u2019t change the negative outlook for free cash flow, and \u201clikely presents a tough upside case.\u201d Subin reiterated his buy rating on the stock, but he trimmed his price target to $260 from $270. Still, the new price target implies about 50% upside to current levels. Boeing\u2019s stock has tumbled 33.3% year to date, enough to make it the S&P 500 index\u2019s \n        SPX\n       worst performer this year. The S&P 500 has gained 8.1% year to date.

As Jim Reid and other strategists at Deutsche Bank point out, the S&P 500 hasn\u2019t seen a new ATH in seven straight sessions, the longest such stretch since January when it topped the peak of 2022.  That dearth of highs may keep rolling on, after CPI data came in hotter-than-forecast, roiling stock futures.

Recent strong payrolls data has impressed upon some observers that the Fed has one less reason to rush into a rate cut. Read: Will inflation ever go down? That\u2019s what frustrated Americans are asking ahead of March CPI. Onto our call of the day from Jack Manley, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, who says the Fed has this all wrong, and is making things far worse as it data watches for clues on when to move.  \u201cA lot of what\u2019s going on today can be very closely linked to the level of interest rates. You slice and dice inflation, whether you\u2019re looking at the headline number, the core number, you\u2019re removing the goods equation,\u201d Manley said in a Bloomberg interview on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s shelter on the headline side of things, it\u2019s automobile insurance on the core services side of things. Both of these things are going to be direct reflections of the interest rate environment,\u201d said Manley. \u201cI think we\u2019re in this funny, peculiar chicken-and-the-egg type situation where you\u2019re not going to see meaningful downward pressure on inflation until you see meaningful downward pressure on shelter costs. And you\u2019re not going to see meaningful downward pressure on shelter costs, until the Fed lowers interest rates,\u201d he said.  Manley\u2019s boss, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, earlier this week warned shareholders that U.S. interest rates could surge to 8% or due to a laundry list of inflationary pressures, such as \u201congoing fiscal spending.\u201d Read: Stocks traders should watch 10-year more than CPI itself, says Mike Wilson While investors will have to endure another set of inflation numbers on Thursday, via PPI, relief from data is on the way as earnings season begins Friday.

            "text": "A whistleblower has reportedly complained to federal regulators that Boeing Co. overlooked safety concerns in the production of its 787 Dreamliner jets. The New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Federal Aviation Administration is investigating claims made by Sam Salehpour, a veteran Boeing engineer, who said the plane maker used shortcuts during the 787 assembly process that could critically strain fasteners in the planes\u2019 fuselage. He claimed the strained joints could reduce the planes\u2019 lifespan and potentially cause catastrophic damage. Late Tuesday, the Associated Press reported Boeing CEO David Calhoun has been summoned to testify before a Senate subcommittee next week on the safety of Boeing\u2019s planes. Boeing denied the allegations, and said it is \u201cfully confident\u201d in the 787 Dreamliner. \u201cThese claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate and do not represent the comprehensive work Boeing has done to ensure the quality and long-term safety of the aircraft,\u201d Boeing said in a statement. Boeing said the issues raised have been subject to \u201crigorous\u201d testing and analysis, which \u201dhas validated that these issues do not present any safety concerns and the aircraft will maintain its service life over several decades.\u201d Boeing stock \n        BA,\n        +0.28%\n       fell about 2% on Tuesday. Dreamliner deliveries were suspended for about two years starting in 2020 due to production and regulatory issues. Production was halted again last year for about a month, after a documentation and data-analysis error was found. The whistleblower allegations are the latest bit of troubling news for Boeing, which has been wracked in recent months by safety and quality issues, particularly concerning its 737 Max aircraft. Production of new planes has slowed, and CEO Calhoun has announced he\u2019ll step down at the end of the year. Earlier Tuesday, Boeing reported its worst quarterly delivery numbers in nearly three years.

            "text": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A Senate subcommittee has summoned\u00a0Boeing CEO David Calhoun\u00a0to testify about the company\u2019s jetliners in an inquiry prompted by new safety-related charges from a whistleblower. The panel said it will hold a hearing next week featuring a Boeing quality engineer, Sam Salehpour, who is expected to detail safety concerns involving the manufacture and assembly of the 787 Dreamliner. The subcommittee said in a letter that those problems could create \u201cpotentially catastrophic safety risks.\u201d Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.25%\n       would not say whether Calhoun plans to attend the April 17 hearing. In response to a query from The Associated Press, a spokesperson said only that the company is cooperating with the subcommittee\u2019s inquiry and has \u201coffered to provide documents, testimony and technical briefings.\u201d The Federal Aviation Administration has also been investigating Salehpour\u2019s allegations since February, according to the subcommittee. The FAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Salehpour, whose concerns were featured in a\u00a0New York Times article\u00a0Tuesday, is also expected to describe retaliation he faced after bringing his concerns forward. Read more: FAA reportedly investigating whistleblower claims alleging flaws in Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner According to that account, Salehpour worked on the 787 but grew alarmed over changes to the assembly of the fuselage, the main body of the aircraft. That process entails fitting together and fastening giant sections of the fuselage, each one produced by a different company, according to Salehpour\u2019s account. Salehpour told the Times he believed Boeing was taking shortcuts that led to excessive force in the assembly process, creating deformations in the composite material used in the aircraft\u2019s outer skin. Such composites often consist of plastic layers reinforced by a mesh of carbon or glass fibers, increasing tensile strength and making them a useful substitute for heavier metals. But composites can lose those benefits if they are twisted or otherwise deformed. Salehpour alleged that such problems could create increased material fatigue, possibly leading to premature failure of the composite, according to the Times account. Over thousands of flights, those pieces of fuselage could risk breaking apart mid-flight. According to Salehpour\u2019s account, Boeing not only failed to take his concerns seriously, it silenced him and transferred him to work on a different jetliner, a move he took as retaliation. In a 1,500 word statement, Boeing said it was \u201cfully confident\u201d in the 787 and called concerns about structural integrity \u201cinaccurate.\u201d Boeing added that the issues raised in the Times story \u201cdo not present any safety concerns\u201d and said the 787 \u201cwill maintain its service life over several decades.\u201d \u201cRetaliation is strictly prohibited at Boeing,\u201d the company added in the statement, noting that it encourages employees to \u201cspeak up when issues arise.\u201d Boeing\u2019s safety record\u00a0has been under a microscope since a door panel on a 737 Max 9 jet\u00a0blew out over Oregon in early January. The panel plugged a space left for an extra emergency door on the jet, which was operated by Alaska Airlines. Pilots were able to land safely, and there were no injuries. But accident investigators\u2019 subsequent discovery of\u00a0missing bolts intended to secure the panel\u00a0rocked Boeing, which once boasted an enviable safety culture.\u00a0Alaska Airlines \n        ALK,\n        -1.60%\n      \u00a0and United Airlines \n        UAL,\n        -1.63%\n       \u2014 the two U.S. carriers that fly the Max 9 \u2014 also reported finding\u00a0loose bolts and other hardware\u00a0in other panels, suggesting that quality issues with the door plugs were not limited to one plane. Both the 787 and the 737 Max have been plagued by production defects that have sporadically held up deliveries and left airlines short of planes during busy travel seasons. Calhoun, the CEO, announced in March that he will\u00a0retire at the end of the year. That followed the departure of another high-ranking Boeing executive and the decision by Boeing\u2019s board chairman not to stand for reelection in May. If Trump is elected president in November, he will face the U.S. government\u2019s growing debt burden. He might try to resolve the issue by defaulting.

            "text": "\nBoeing\n       delivered two dozen 737 MAX jets in March, down 54% year over year. That result wasn\u2019t entirely bad news, but the numbers mean investors should brace for lower quarterly earnings than Wall Street is forecasting.  The aerospace company said Tuesday that it shipped 29 jets, including 24 MAX planes, in March. It delivered 64 jets, including 52 MAX planes, in March 2023.   For the first quarter, Boeing delivered 83 planes, including 67 MAX jets. That compares with 130 jets, including 111 MAX models, in the first quarter of 2023.  Not only are the numbers lower than they were a year earlier, the quarterly results look light. Wall Street analysts had projected 104 first-quarter deliveries, including 71 MAX jets.   Boeing stock was unaffected in midday trading Tuesday. Shares were down 0.3% at $181.11, while the \n        S&P 500\n       and \n        Dow Jones Industrial Average\n       were off 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively.  The stock is holding up because investors already knew things were going slow at Boeing. The company is making fewer planes in the aftermath of the Jan. 5 blowout of an emergency-door plug on a 737 MAX 9 jet operated by \n        Alaska Air.\n       The incident resulted in more oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration and a renewed focus on quality at the company.  Going slower isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. To improve initial quality, Boeing management has committed to relaying less on traveled work. Traveled work refers to doing a job somewhere else on the assembly line than where it was originally designed to be completed. Investors should still brace for a first-quarter earnings miss\u2014unless Wall Street updates its numbers soon. Currently, analysts project a per-share loss of $1.21 and a cash outflow of $3.9 billion, according to Bloomberg. But Boeing has already told investors that the first-quarter cash outflow will exceed $4 billion.  A year ago, Boeing reported a first-quarter loss of $1.27 a share.  Boeing is set to report first-quarter results on April 24. Any comments from management about progress made in improving production and quality likely would offset the damage from a lower earnings number than Wall Street has penciled in. The stock\u2019s starting point is a big reason for that. Through midday trading, Boeing stock was down about 30% year to date. Shares were down about 27% since the Jan. 5 emergency-door-plug blowout.

            "text": "Jamie Dimon probably bought his crystal ball from a thrift shop\u2014remember his \u201ceconomic hurricane\u201d prediction in 2022? But the \n        JPMorgan\n       CEO may be on to something in his latest annual letter to shareholders. His forecast that interest rates could reach 8% might seem outlandish but Dimon\u2019s warning around inflation and rates staying higher than expected ought to be taken more seriously. Wednesday\u2019s consumer price index is expected to show inflation ticking back up to 3.4% in March, from 3.2% in February. The Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target is proving elusive. Dimon has several longer-term inflationary concerns, including increased military spending as global conflicts intensify, the fiscal spending needed to transition to a green economy, and rising healthcare costs. When, or if, the Fed reaches its target the battle won\u2019t be over. For example, Spain\u2019s inflation rate fell below 2% in June last year but it has proved to be a one-off and now sits at 3.2%. The prospect of interest rates staying higher for longer has been in and out of fashion over the past year, but it\u2019s back in vogue. The market\u2019s confidence that March would bring about the start of lower borrowing costs has been replaced with uncertainty about whether June will be the date for the first cut. The market is pricing in a 51% chance of that, according to CME\u2019s FedWatch tool. Even the probability of a cut by July is slipping\u2014currently at 70%, down from 92% a month ago. But, crucially, investors don\u2019t share Dimon\u2019s economic pessimism. Stocks have reached record levels this year. The market sees resilient economic data pointing to robust corporate earnings and will remain happy as long as inflation is trending lower and rate cuts are in the cards at some point this year. Earnings season, starting in earnest Friday, and Wednesday\u2019s inflation data will test those two conditions. \u2014Callum Keown Inflation and interest rates may remain higher than investors expect thanks to costs tied to increased military investments, climate change mitigation efforts, global supply-chain reconfigurations, and rising healthcare costs, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders. What\u2019s Next: The bank boss said that small changes in interest rates today may have less impact on inflation in the future than many people believe. He warned to be prepared for a very broad range of interest rates from 2% to 8% or even more. However his prediction contrasts with that of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who signaled last week that interest-rate cuts this year are still on the table. \u2014Rebecca Ungarino and Angela Palumbo Traders now see the possibility the Federal Reserve won\u2019t cut interest rates as sharply this year, which is a view supported by the stronger-than-expected March jobs report. Rather than the six or seven cuts expected in January, some traders now see just a couple, and some see the possibility of no cuts. What\u2019s Next: Some Fed officials have said in the past week they are concerned inflation declines could stall. Wednesday\u2019s consumer price index for March, expected to rise 0.3% from the prior month, could help make the argument for the Fed waiting a while longer to cut rates. \u2014Liz Moyer President Joe Biden is still trying to expand the number of people eligible for student debt forgiveness, announcing another plan to help nearly 30 million federal loan borrowers, including parents who took out loans to pay for their children\u2019s education. It is still vulnerable to legal challenges. What\u2019s Next: More than 40% of Generation Z swing-state voters surveyed by Bloomberg and Morning Consult late last year said Biden wasn\u2019t doing enough about student debt. If this latest plan moves forward, some borrowers could have their debts canceled before the November election. \u2014Elizabeth O\u2019Brien and Janet H. Cho \nBlackstone\u2019s\n       planned $10 billion purchase of the upscale apartment buildings owner \n        Apartment Income REIT,\n       or AIR Communities (AIRC), could be a sign that the asset manager sees an opportunity to snap up some real estate, especially in the rental properties market. What\u2019s Next: The transaction was unanimously approved by AIR\u2019s board of directors and is expected to close in the third quarter. As a condition of the transaction, AIR Communities suspended payment of its quarterly dividend.  \u2014Janet H. Cho \nSpirit Airlines\n       will delay some of its deliveries from European plane maker \n        Airbus,\n       a decision that could make some aircraft available for use by rival carriers after capacity problems created by U.S. rival \n        Boeing\u2019s\n       regulatory, production, and safety issues. For Spirit, the move will boost liquidity by $340 million over the next two years. What\u2019s Next: Spirit CEO Ted Christie said the change would help Spirit bolster profitability and strengthen its balance sheet. Spirit also expects to receive $150 million to $200 million as part of a compensation agreement with \n        RTXCorp.\u2019s\n       Pratt & Whitney because of issues with its GTF engines. \u2014Callum Keown and Janet H.

            "text": "By Christian Moess Laursen BP expects a boost to first-quarter profit from higher oil, gas and low-carbon energy production, while lower natural-gas prices will temper gains. The British energy major on Tuesday backed its guidance of higher upstream production--the extraction of raw crude oil and natural gas--in the first quarter, with higher output in oil production and operations and slightly higher production of gas and low-carbon energy compared with the previous quarter. In the fourth quarter, BP's oil production was 1.42 million of oil-equivalent barrels a day, while it produced 899,000 BOE a day of gas and low-carbon energy. Its shares were up 1.7% to 518.00 pence at 0743 GMT, having climbed 13% over the past three months. The update follows that of BP's closest rival Shell, which on Friday lifted its guidance for first-quarter production of integrated gas and liquefied natural gas. The London-based oil-and-gas companies are the first European majors to provide updates on first-quarter production and earnings amid concerns that natural-gas businesses could face pressure after prices dropped on year in 2023, following a spike in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. BP said lower natural-gas prices will likely hit both its gas and low-carbon energy segment as well as its oil production and operations segment this quarter. It said Brent averaged $83.16 a barrel in the quarter compared to $84.34 in the preceding quarter, while gas prices averaged $2.25 per million British thermal units versus $2.88. Additionally, profit from its gas and low-carbon energy segment is expected to take a hit of $400 million to $600 million, mainly due to lower natural-gas prices and the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. Price lags on production in the Gulf of Mexico and the United Arab Emirates are expected to drive a $300 million-$600 million dent to profit from oil production and operations. However, its gas marketing and trading result is expected to be strong, the company added. In the first quarter of 2023, the FTSE 100-listed energy group reported gas and low-carbon energy production of 969,000 BOE a day and oil production of 1.36 million BOE a day. BP also said its net debt is expected to increase in the first quarter, mainly reflecting a working-capital build plus phasing of capital expenditure and divestment and other proceeds, as previously guided. For the full-year, BP still sees slightly higher upstream production than in 2023, with higher oil production and lower gas and low-carbon energy production.

            "text": "Earnings season is coming\u2014and it might just be what the stock market needs to drive the next leg higher.  First-quarter earnings kick off this coming week, with companies such as \n        Delta Air Lines,\nConstellation Brands,\nJPMorgan Chase,\n       and \n        Fastenal\n       set to report their profits. Results will probably come in higher than analysts\u2019 current estimates. In the past four quarters, aggregate earnings per share for the \n        S&P 500\n       have beaten expectations by 7.1% on average, according to Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, so it would take quite a sea change for companies to suddenly miss.  Beats might not be quite as large as in recent quarters\u2014a decelerating economy could lead to slower earnings growth\u2014but they are still likely. Senyek estimates that companies in the S&P 500 should beat earnings by a \u201cvery healthy\u201d 4% to 5%. That\u2019s not only plausible, but highly achievable, given that analysts covering S&P 500 companies have reduced first-quarter earnings forecasts by 2.5% this year, making it easier for companies to turn in better-than-forecast results.  Beats alone won\u2019t be enough, though. The market will also need to see encouraging forward-looking guidance from management teams to justify higher valuations. After gaining 25% since its October low, the S&P 500 trades at 20.1 times expected earnings per share for the coming 12 months, up from 16.7 times. Strong guidance would validate the market\u2019s belief that sales and profits can keep growing, keeping stocks moving higher. But anything that causes analysts to reduce profit forecasts could easily cause the stock market to drop.  The good news is that the early signs are positive. In the past three months, more companies have increased earnings guidance than reduced it, according to 22V Research. The gap in increases versus decreases has been near its widest level in about two years. What\u2019s more, S&P 500 companies, in aggregate, expect sales and earnings to rise from quarter to quarter throughout this year. As long as they signal that demand for goods and services is strong enough to support the revenue trends, the stock market will be satisfied, especially since the Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t expect to hike rates any further.  \u201cManagement guidance should remain very solid as well, reflecting Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s willingness to let the U.S. economy \u2018run hot\u2019 in the months ahead,\u201d writes Wolfe\u2019s Senyek. \u201cAs such, we expect trends coming out of 1Q reporting season to provide support for equity markets to keep pushing higher.\u201d  Keep an eye on Constellation Brands, which reports on April 11. Analysts expect the purveyor of wine and beer to report fiscal-year fourth-quarter sales of $2.47 billion and earnings of $3.19 a share. Profits are relatively stable in the alcohol business, where the company\u2019s Modelo beer in particular is doing quite well, and the company has beaten bottom-line estimates in 18 of the past 20 quarters, according to FactSet. A beat and solid guidance could go a long way toward reversing the 4.2% decline the stock has suffered in recent days.  And that would go down like a fine wine\u2014or a bottle of Modelo.

            "text": "By Kimberley Kao The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is investigating an incident in which an engine cover fell off a Southwest Airlines-flown Boeing 737-800 jet during takeoff from Denver, Colorado, on Sunday. The FAA said Flight 3695, which was headed for Houston, Texas, returned safely to the Denver International Airport around 8:15 a.m. after its crew reported that an engine cover fell off during takeoff and struck a wing flap. The aircraft was towed to the gate upon landing, the FAA said. Southwest said in a statement that maintenance teams were reviewing the aircraft and apologized for the delay. The passengers were moved to another aircraft and were expected to arrive in Houston approximately three hours behind schedule. A Boeing spokesperson referred the request to Southwest for information about the jet and the airline's fleet operations. The 737-800 is a variant of Boeing's 737 Next-Generation aircraft. The incident Sunday is the latest under investigation by the FAA related to engine and other issues of Southwest-operated Boeing planes in recent weeks. Last week, a Southwest Boeing 737 flight bound for Las Vegas was cancelled after an engine caught fire shortly after the plane taxied from the gate at Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport in Texas. Last month, a Southwest Boeing flight from Austin, Texas, turned around mid-flight after its crew reported a possible engine issue, according to the FAA. The crews for two separate Southwest Boeing flights on March 22 reported issues related to a flap and an engine, respectively, the FAA's website shows.

            "text": "\nSpirit Airlines\n       has opted to delay some \n        Airbus\n       aircraft deliveries until the beginning of the next decade to boost liquidity. It could help carriers frustrated by \n        Boeing\u2019s\n       delays. The ultra-low-cost carrier said Monday it has agreed to defer all aircraft orders scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of 2025 through the end of 2026 until 2030-2031. However, there are no changes to orders set to be delivered in 2027-2029. The deferrals will improve Spirit\u2019s liquidity position by $340 million over the next two years, it said in a filing. The airline also said it will furlough 260 pilots from Sept.1 due the move as well as the grounding of other aircraft through engine-related problems. \nSpirit\n       ended 2023 with an all-Airbus fleet of 205 aircraft and firm orders for 99 planes to be delivered through 2029, according to its 10-K annual filing in February. A number of those orders have now been pushed out beyond 2030. That could free up some Airbus aircraft in the coming years, or help carriers take earlier deliveries. Airlines are becoming increasingly frustrated by \n        Boeing\u2019s\n       regulatory, production and safety problems\u2014\n        United Airlines\n       has even asked pilots to take unpaid leave next month as the delivery delays have led to overstaffing as it will now receive fewer planes than expected. \n        Southwest Airlines\n       and \n        Ryanair,\n       two major Boeing customers, have cut capacity this year. The number of aircraft being deferred isn\u2019t huge\u2014Spirit\u2019s 99 orders were spread evenly over the five years to 2029\u2013but \n        JetBlue\n       made a similar move earlier this year in a bid to cut costs. That could offer some scope for carriers to order more Airbus A320s to fill the void left by Boeing\u2019s delays. Airbus stock rose 1.1% in European trading, while Boeing shares pointed 1.2% lower ahead of the U.S. market open Monday. Spirit Airlines reported losses in three of the four quarters last year despite surging travel demand. Wall Street currently expects its two-quarter losing streak to extend through the next eight quarters. The shares were largely being propped up by Spirit\u2019s proposed merger with JetBlue until the deal was blocked by a federal judge, who sided with the Justice Department\u2019s view that it would lead to higher fares.

It\u2019s the second mishap this week for the airline, with a flight from Texas canceled Thursday after a report of an engine fire.

            "text": "Regulatory News: TotalEnergies (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) has agreed to acquire the 20% interest held by Lewis Energy Group in the Dorado leases operated by EOG Resources (80%) in the Eagle Ford shale gas play, increasing its natural gas production capacity in Texas and further strengthening its business integration in the U.S. LNG value chain. TotalEnergies increases its natural gas production in the U.S Located in Texas, the Dorado field will allow TotalEnergies to increase its net U.S. natural gas production by 50 million cubic feet a day (Mcf/d) in 2024, with the potential for an additional 50 Mcf/d by 2028. The field has an emission intensity of around 10 kg CO(2) e/boe. In 2023, TotalEnergies' net U.S. natural gas output reached around 340 Mcf/d (450 Mcf/d technical production). TotalEnergies, largest exporter of U.S. LNG With over 10 million tons (Mt) in 2023, TotalEnergies was the number one exporter of U.S. LNG, thanks to its 16.6% stake in the Cameron LNG plant in Louisiana and several long-term purchasing agreements. The Company's LNG export capacity will reach 15 Mt/y by 2030 following the start-up of the first phase of the Rio Grande LNG project in Texas, currently under construction. \"This acquisition strengthens our production of natural gas in the United States, contributing to reinforce TotalEnergies' LNG integration with a low cost and low emission upstream gas feed,\" said Nicolas Terraz, President, Exploration & Production at TotalEnergies. \"We are pleased to partner with EOG Resources, an operator recognized for its strong technical expertise.\" *** TotalEnergies in the United States TotalEnergies is deploying its integrated energy model in the United States, where it has been active since 1957. With over 10 Mt of output in 2023, TotalEnergies is the leading exporter of US LNG, thanks to its 16.6% stake in the Cameron LNG plant in Louisiana and long-term supply contracts. By 2030, this capacity will reach 15 Mt/y, following the start-up of the Rio Grande LNG plant in South Texas. With upstream gas production assets in Texas, the Company is integrated throughout the LNG value chain. The US is a key country for the deployment of TotalEnergies' Integrated Power strategy, where its portfolio includes 25 GW of renewables projects, flexible generation assets, including 1.5 GW of gas-fired power plants in Texas, and a trading center in Houston. The Company is also active in upstream oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, and in refining and petrochemicals, centered on its platform in Port Arthur (Texas). TotalEnergies is also present in CCS and in low-carbon fuels, such as biogas and e-NG. TotalEnergies, the world's third largest LNG player TotalEnergies is the world's third largest LNG player with a global portfolio of 44 Mt/y in 2023 thanks to its interests in liquefaction plants in all geographies. The Company benefits from an integrated position across the LNG value chain, including production, transportation, access to more than 20 Mt/y of regasification capacity in Europe, trading, and LNG bunkering. TotalEnergies' ambition is to increase the share of natural gas in its sales mix to close to 50% by 2030, to reduce carbon emissions and eliminate methane emissions associated with the gas value chain, and to work with local partners to promote the transition from coal to natural gas.

            "text": "\nBoeing\n       CEO Dave Calhoun took home $32.8 million in pay for 2023, up 45% compared with the $22.5 million earned in 2022. Last year was a good one for the company, but 2024 hasn\u2019t started out as well.  Boeing filed its annual proxy statement on Friday evening, including a summary of compensation for major executives. Calhoun\u2019s pay includes $1.4 million in salary and $30.2 million in stock awards. Other compensation makes up the balance.  It was the highest annual pay for a Boeing CEO this century, company filings show, despite Calhoun declining a $2.8 million bonus.  Some of the $30.2 million is performance-based pay, which is set according to a variety of financial metrics. One is free cash flow, which took off last year, rising to $4.4 billion from $2 billion in 2022.   Free cash flow in 2024 is expected to fall as the company deals with the aftermath of the 737 MAX 9 emergency-door-plug blowout on Jan. 5. The incident has led to more oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration; more costs for Boeing, such as compensation paid to airline customers for missed deliveries and lost capacity to handle passengers; and slower production of MAX jets.  Boeing said Calhoun\u2019s 2024 performance-based compensation target would be reduced to $13.25 million from $17 million. The target performance pay is essentially what is earned if things go as expected. The final pay awarded can move higher or lower depending on how the company, and its CEO, do relative to the goals set by the board of directors.   Boeing added that it will link Calhoun\u2019s2024 compensation to two new safety and production quality goals. Part of one goal includes the \u201cdesign and deployment of an employee culture survey,\u201d The second goal includes the \u201cdevelopment and implementation of operational control limits for several programs, including the 737 program.\u201d  More than 50% of the 2024 performance award is tied to the two goals.  This is Calhoun\u2019s final year as CEO. He announced his departure in March without the board naming a successor. The search is on for the next CEO.  Company filings show Calhoun made a bit less than $100 million between 2020 and 2023 running the company. Boeing stock was at about $330 a share when he took over; shares closed at $183.14 on Friday.  The stock is down about 30% so far this year, making it the fifth-worst-performing stock in the \n        S&P 500.\n       Most of the declines came after the door blowout.

            "text": "In an orderly world, companies would increase revenue and profits steadily to support a continual lifting of earnings estimates and price targets for stocks. But life is never simple. The general trend is for the stock market as a whole to rise along with corporate profits, but there are always exceptions, and these can help investors understand what to avoid \u2014 and where new opportunities may lie. Last week we looked back at how the favorite stocks among analysts who work for brokerage firms had performed over the past five years. It turned out that the brokers had fared pretty well.  Today we will look at current consensus price targets for stocks among analysts polled by FactSet, and we\u2019ll list the companies for which the targets have declined the most since the end of last year.  The analysts tend to specialize in particular sectors or industries. They assign the equivalent of buy, hold or sell ratings to stocks, along with price targets that are typically meant to cover the next 12 months. The ratings have a positive skew. There are relatively few sell or equivalent ratings, in part because analysts might believe bad news for a company is already baked into its share price. It might be too late to drop to a sell rating after bad news has been reported.  Among the S&P 500 \n        SPX,\n       53% of companies have majority buy ratings, and only one company has majority sell ratings: Expeditors International of Washington Inc. \n        EXPD,\n        +0.74%.\n Getting back to what analysts and investors want to see, so far this year consensus price targets have increased for 80% of the S&P 500. If you are wondering how many of these 402 stocks have risen in price this year, the answer is 320, or 80%.  Now let\u2019s screen the S&P 500 for the companies whose consensus price targets have declined the most this year through Monday, according to data provided by FactSet: For Tesla Inc. \n        TSLA,\n        -1.53%,\n       the consensus price target has declined 16.9% this year, while the share price has gone down 29.5% through Monday. Sometimes an analyst will stick with a buy rating but lower their price target as a stock falls. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has taken a strong bullish stance for Tesla for a long time, but last week he cut his price target for the stock to $300 from $315 and described a \u201cwhite-knuckle period\u201d for the company. There are 51 analysts polled by FactSet who are covering Tesla, and a third of them rate the stock a buy or the equivalent, while 20% rate it a sell or the equivalent, and the rest have neutral ratings on the shares. Ives and two other analysts have $300 price targets for the stock \u2014 the highest among the analysts. The consensus price target for Tesla is $200.39, and the stock closed at $175.22 Monday. News early Tuesday: Tesla\u2019s stock slumps as delivery numbers miss the mark by a wide margin Humana Inc. \n        HUM,\n        -1.10%\n       leads the list with the largest consensus-price-target decline among the S&P 500 this year. The company is among several managed-care providers that are focused on Medicare Advantage plans. The problem has been a lower-than-expected payout rate by Medicare. Michael Taylor, the lead portfolio manager for the Simplify Health Care exchange-traded fund \n        PINK,\n       highlighted Cigna Group \n        CI,\n        +0.05%\n       as standing out among managed-care companies in the S&P 500, since it mainly provides service through employer-sponsored health-insurance plans. Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. \n        WBD,\n        -1.69%\n       is an interesting case that signals the need for more data. The consensus price target for the stock has declined 15.5% this year, while the share price has fallen 22.8%. The target price of $13.21 is 50% higher than Monday\u2019s closing price of $8.79. And 17 of 31 analysts polled by FactSet rate the stock a buy or the equivalent.

Year-to-date performance for AmEx/S&P 500, respectively, is +18%/+9.8%.  We like the setup after the sell-off yesterday [April 4] and going into the first-quarter print at 16.5 times our calendar-2024 price/earnings. We also like the potential for positive revisions to medium-term guidance during its investor day on April 30. In the near term, we underestimated AmEx\u2019s resiliency, owing to its higher-end consumer; spend/lend levels of customers set the company up well should macro softness materialize. \nSchlumberger\n       \u2022 SLB-NYSE\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\tBuy \u2022 Price $55.22 on April 2\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\tby Jefferies\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\tSchlumberger agreed to acquire \n        ChampionX\n       in an all-stock transaction for $7.75 billion, strengthening its core business while progressing on its returns-focused and capital-light strategy.  ChampionX is primarily involved in providing production chemicals and artificial lift technologies, positioning Schlumberger to increasingly participate in the efficiency improvement/reservoir recovery phase of upstream operations.  We believe the transaction should be favorably received, considering it increases Schlumberger\u2019s exposure to less cyclical/less capital-intensive production business while being accretive to Ebitda margins. The complementary nature of Schlumberger\u2019s and ChampionX\u2019s businesses should allow the company to accomplish the target cost synergies.

It has been well communicated by management that the second and third quarters will be impacted by factory downtime associated with rerating, and we model the biggest impact in the second quarter. With the R2 [midsize sport-utility vehicle] reveal in the rearview, we expect attention will shift to cost reductions and Rivian\u2019s goal to reach positive gross profit per unit in fourth-quarter 2024.  The fourth-quarter 2023 shareholder letter outlined areas for cost reductions that include 50% from variable costs (design changes, supplier negotiations, raw material costs); 35% fixed cost efficiencies; and 15% in nonvehicle revenue (service, accessories, insurance, etc).

For respiratory viruses, Moderna shared a positive interim Phase 3 update from its next-generation, refrigerator-stable mRNA vaccine. Its design offers the potential of longer shelf life and storage advantages, also advantageous for the combination vaccine against influenza/Covid-19.  Flu regulatory filings are planned this year; Moderna strengthened its prospects with the Blackstone deal [for collaboration with Moderna\u2019s influenza program].

            "text": "Dave Calhoun, the outgoing chief executive of troubled aerospace giant Boeing Co., saw his total compensation climb last year by 45%, to $32.8 million, according to a filing Friday. Much of Calhoun\u2019s salary increase was driven by a retention bonus intended to keep him in the top job at Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.33%\n       through 2025. But he also gave up a roughly $3 million cash bonus and is receiving less stock this year following a high-profile aircraft accident in January that has thrown Boeing\u2019s 737 Max program into disarray. Calhoun\u2019s 2023 compensation included $1.4 million in salary plus equity awards valued at $30.2 million. His pay totaled $22.6 million in 2022, including $17 million in stock and options.  Boeing\u2019s share price rose almost 29% last year, but is down about 30% so far in 2024. Boeing\u2019s board recently said that Calhoun would step down by year-end and that it was searching for a new boss. A door-plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines \n        ALK,\n        -1.35%\n       flight in January has led to federal probes and slowed down production lines.

            "text": "What to do with shares of \n        Spirit AeroSystems\n       is a tricky question for investors to answer. While \n        Boeing\n       will likely take over the company, the price it will pay is nearly impossible to predict.  Investors should err on the side of caution.  The issue isn\u2019t whether a deal will happen. Boeing and Spirit Aero, its fuselage supplier, confirmed that they were in merger talks about a month ago. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun answered, \u201cI hope soon\u201d on March 25 in response to a question about when a deal could be done. More recently, reports about a deal to sell the part of Spirit that makes components for \n        Airbus\n       have surfaced.   Boeing declined to comment. Spirit Aero didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.  The valuation issue is difficult. Wall Street\u2019s targets for Spirit stock range from $28 to $42, while the shares were at just under $35 in early trading on Friday. That is up from roughly $29 before news of the merger talks boosted the price.   At $35 a share, Spirit Aero is trading for about 17 times the per-share earnings expected for 2025. The \n        S&P 500\n       trades for closer to 19 times.  Two arguments for a higher price are that Spirit\u2019s margins are expected to improve in coming years. And companies typically pay a premium in takeovers, reflecting savings or other benefits the deals are expected to achieve.  The cost savings in a merger between Spirit and Boeing could easily amount to $100 million to $200 million a year. Including those savings, Spirit might sell for higher than even the Street\u2019s most optimistic call of $42 a share.  The Airbus business is what complicates matters. While it accounted for almost 20% of Spirit\u2019s 2023 sales, it has to be sold. There is no way Boeing can keep Airbus as a customer.   The problem is that the business isn\u2019t big enough to operate efficiently. Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard wrote Friday that the Spirit plants supplying Airbus needed significant investment\u2014as much as $1 billion\u2014to perform up to snuff.  No one is going to pay a lot for the Airbus business if they have to invest $1 billion. It is a lot of money, considering that Spirit\u2019s market capitalization is about $4 billion.  The problem for Boeing and Spirit is a little like what happens to NFL or MLB teams looking to unload players under expensive contracts. This year, the Denver Broncos released quarterback Russell Wilson two years into a five-year, $245 million contract. They couldn\u2019t find anyone to trade for that contract.  Last year, the New York Mets got the Texas Rangers to agree to take Max Scherzer, partly by paying roughly $35 million of the remaining $58 million due to the player. The Mets got a minor-league prospect in return.  Both players were valuable assets that required a lot of investment, making them less appealing to other teams. \u201cThat could be the situation here,\u201d said Stallard when asked about selling the Airbus business.  He isn\u2019t bullish on Spirit Aero. He rates the stock at Hold with a target of $31 for the price. While a takeover is likely, the party getting the best deal will probably be the one buying the Airbus business.   Spirit Aero stock was up 2.1% in early trading at $34.74 a share while the \n        S&P 500\n       and \n        Nasdaq Composite\n       were up 0.6% and 1%, respectively. Boeing shares are up 0.2%.  Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com Oversold rally earlier this week doesn\u2019t erase the U.S.  market\u2019s negative picture.

We might earn a commission from links in this content. Learn more Most Americans are not earning as much as they could on their savings,\u00a0 with 67% of savers getting less than 4%, according to Bankrate\u2019s latest savings report. This despite plenty of savings accounts paying over 5% (see some of the higher paying savings accounts you can get now here) \u2014 and \u201cdespite widespread availability of higher returns on federally-insured accounts with little or no minimum deposit required,\u201d says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. While traditional savings accounts often pay very low interest rates, high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) typically earn much higher rates. Usually, like traditional savings accounts, they tend to come with minimal risk (most are FDIC or NCUA-insured up to $250,000) and flexible options like being able to transfer or withdraw funds at no cost.\u00a0 This can make them a smart place to park cash that you need easily accessible, like an emergency fund, pros say. \u201cMany financial advisers recommend keeping an emergency fund of 3 to 6 months\u2019 worth of expenses in a safe investment such as a high-yield savings account, but there are many factors that should be considered,\u201d says certified financial planner Alison James at WorthWise Financial Partners. \u201cHow stable is your employment? Are there one or two earners in the family? Are there dependents? What percentage of expenses are discretionary versus fixed?.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0(See some of the higher paying savings accounts you can get now here) Paying attention to interest rates on your high-yield savings account is key as they affect how much you earn. That said, you\u2019ll also want to be sure you understand any restrictions or fees associated with the accounts you\u2019re opening. \u201cChange banks to wipe away useless overdraft and account maintenance fees \u2013 and switch savings to earn more interest back on your money with a competitive annual percentage yield,\u201d says consumer savings expert Andrea Woroch.\u00a0 Here are the highest-paying savings accounts we found this month. Note that some of the credit unions have strict membership rules, but other banks on this list offer the high APYs without as many hoops to jump through. Those who live, work, go to school in Washington State or are affiliated with Boeing are eligible for membership. Members who open a savings account aren\u2019t subject to monthly maintenance fees or minimum balance requirements. They can also earn a premium rate of 6.17% \u2014 but the big catch is that it\u2019s only on the first $500 deposited. To qualify for this offer, members must have both a BECU checking and savings account, sign up to receive monthly eStatements and make at least one free electronic transaction per month. It\u2019s now possible to earn 5.75% APY on new account deposits up to $1,000, or you can earn a lofty 5.61% on balances $1,000.01 and higher. Whether you\u2019re a member of the military or one of Andrews\u2019 select employee groups across Maryland, Washington DC, Virginia and New Jersey, accounts opened through online or mobile banking qualify for this tiered, variable rate account. BrioDirect is part of the FDIC-insured institution Webster Bank, and the account has no monthly maintenance fee. The catch? You must deposit a minimum of $5,000 to open an account. Open an account with just $500 and earn 5.35% with no monthly account fees. In addition, you\u2019ll get online and mobile banking access, automatic deposits and easy access to your funds, which are FDIC insured through My Banking Direct\u2019s Flagstar Bank NA relationship. Guaranteed through June 30, 2024, earn 5.30% when you open an account with a $2,500 minimum balance. The payoff caps out at $1 million and transfers and withdrawals are limited to 6 per calendar month. No fees and a $1 minimum deposit make earning this 5.30% APY pretty easy. Interest is compounded daily and account balances are FDIC-insured up to $250,000. Paying more than 11 times the national average, TAB Bank has no minimum balance, standard deposit insurance of $250,000 per depositor, no balance caps, no monthly maintenance fees, and access to online and mobile banking. This modern, digital bank provides 24/7 online access to funds and only requires a $1 minimum deposit to earn 5.26% APY. There are no fees associated with this savings account and deposits are federally insured through Third Coast Bank. All you need is one dollar to open an eligible account and earn 5.26% APY. Interest is compounded daily and funds are FDIC insured up to $250,000 per depositor. With physical branches in Connecticut, all you need to open a promotional high yield savings account here is $1.

            "text": "\nBoeing\u2019s\n       737 MAX production has slowed to a crawl. That\u2019s probably a good thing though airline customers might not agree. Boeing suppliers, on the other hand, should be all right\u2014if \n        Boeing\n       can get its act together.  Boeing\u2019s targeted and Federal Aviation Administration-permitted MAX production rate is currently 38 a month. The company delivered 42 MAX jets in January and February. Boeing will report March deliveries in a few days. Investors shouldn\u2019t expect a big number.  \u201cCirium data shows that Boeing only test flew 13\u00a0MAX\u00a0planes in March, similar to the 11 that it flew in February,\u201d wrote Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard in a report Thursday. Cirium is an aviation consultancy used by the industry and Wall Street.  All signs point to another month of around 20 MAX deliveries. Along with new production, Boeing is still delivering MAX jets built and parked during the worldwide MAX grounding between March 2019 and November 2020 following two deadly crashes within five months.  Melius analyst Robert Spingarn believes the first-quarter production rate will end up lower than 20 per month. There is a good reason for lower production. Boeing is working \u201cto minimize traveled work,\u201d wrote the analyst in a report Friday. Traveled work refers to doing jobs on the production line somewhere other than originally designed. Less travel work is a sign Boeing is trying to get its production system under better control. That change came in the aftermath of the early January emergency door plug blowout on a 737 MAX 9 operated by \n        Alaska Air.\n More control and better quality is a positive, but it does put short-term and long-term estimates at risk. Wall Street expects Boeing to deliver about 450 MAX jets in 2024, up from 387 delivered in 2023. In the long term, Boeing expects to produce 50 MAX jets a month. \u201cGiven the current state of the 737 ramp, Boeing\u2019s targeted rate of 50/month in 2025/2026 seems unlikely,\u201d added Spingarn.  Boeing has some 4,800 unfilled orders for 737 MAX jets. At 20 a month, that\u2019s 20 years of backlog. It\u2019s great to have a big backlog but Boeing\u2019s airline customers would balk. Things should improve, still, at 40 a month Boeing has 10 years of backlog and some airlines would be waiting longer than expected for new jets.  That has some implications for Boeing as well as the airlines. Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu noted in a report that Boeing paid Alaska $160 million in compensation for the MAX 9 grounding and lost airline capacity. Extrapolating that payment to other airlines lacking MAX capacity is difficult\u2014only one door plug blew off\u2014but she expects Boeing to report more than $420 million payments to airlines for the first quarter. Boeing \u201cexpects additional compensation to be provided beyond Q1, the terms of which are confidential,\u201d added the analyst.  The production delays make life harder for the airlines and Boeing. There will eventually be an impact on suppliers too. \n        Spirit AeroSystems\n       and \n        Hexcel\n       are two at the biggest risk of estimate cuts, Kahyaoglu wrote. Both companies\u2019 estimates imply production rates closer to 38 a month; she now expects an average of about 30 MAX jets made a month in 2024.    Boeing can still take parts at a higher rate than it is making planes, but investors should, at least, be aware of the potential for cuts given how the year has started.  At 30 a month, it would take Boeing some 13 years to work through its existing MAX backlog. Production rates shouldn\u2019t stay at that level forever. Still, the entire aerospace value chain\u2014from suppliers to airlines\u2014is waiting for things to improve.  Boeing stock was up 0.4% in premarket trading Friday, while \n        S&P 500\n       and \n        Dow Jones Industrial Average\n       futures rose 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively.  Coming into Friday trading, Boeing stock has fallen about 30% this year. MAX troubles have weighed on investor sentiment.

            "title": "Europe Is Itching to Cut Interest Rates, Unlike the Fed. Why It Matters.",
            "text": "While Federal Reserve officials say they are in no rush to cut interest rates, central bankers in Europe seem eager to get the rate-cutting started. There are good reasons for U.S. investors to pay attention: If European central banks cut rates sooner and more aggressively than the Fed, that could reinforce the dollar\u2019s strength.  The Dollar Index, a measure of the dollar\u2019s value against the currencies of most of the U.S.\u2019s key trading partners, has already gained 3.5% this year. A higher dollar diminishes the value of overseas sales of U.S. companies, though it could make Europe a cheaper destination for U.S. tourists. The Bank of England, which sets rates for the United Kingdom, and the European Central Bank, which sets policy for the 20 countries sharing the euro, including Germany and France, are currently expected to cut rates around the same time as the Fed. But there are increasing signs that Europe is itching to start sooner. For one, inflation rates are still falling quickly in the U.K. and the euro zone, whereas in the U.S., the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge suggests that price growth looks sticky. Second, some policymakers in Europe are becoming more vocal about pushing for earlier moves. And third, the economic outlook is much weaker across the pond, providing an extra incentive for central banks to lend support for growth. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says he\u2019s in no hurry to cut interest rates. The personal-consumption expenditures index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation metric, showed a 2.8% annual gain in March, in line with expectations and well above the Fed\u2019s 2% annual inflation target. Economists and investors expect the first Fed cut in June, although the risks seem skewed toward a longer wait. Compare those views to the latest remarks from Bank of England Gov. Andrew Bailey, who told the Financial Times just after the March rate decision that progress on inflation means rate cuts are a possibility at every meeting henceforth. While the two most hawkish members of the rate-setting committee pushed back against Bailey\u2019s comments, they also took a dovish turn\u2014voting to keep rates steady in March after having called for further hikes. With the U.K.\u2019s inflation rate dropping to 3.4% in February from 4% in January, and forecasts calling for it to fall to the 2% target this quarter, one BOE committee member is already voting for cuts. The U.K. economy is emerging from a recession. Economists still see the first rate cut as most likely in August, but markets are pricing in a chance of a cut at the May meeting. ECB President Christine Lagarde won\u2019t commit to a path of cuts but has teed up June as a likely start date. Her colleague, Bank of France Gov. Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau, has hinted at a cut as soon as the next meeting, on April 11. Euro zone inflation dropped to 2.4% in March from 2.6% in February. Last month, the Swiss National Bank surprised markets by cutting rates. It\u2019s the first major central bank to lower borrowing costs since the end of the Covid pandemic. Policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic have become more skeptical about their inflation forecasts. In January, Lagarde lambasted her economists for being too myopic in failing to account for the risks of, say, a pandemic or Russia invading Ukraine.  The BOE, meanwhile, has commissioned former Fed Chairman and Nobel Prize winner Ben Bernanke to write a report on how to improve its forecasting. It is due to be published this month. If officials don\u2019t trust forecasts for inflation, it could lead them to keep rates higher than otherwise\u2014or worry that rates are too high, given the economic conditions. That gives more scope for central bank policies to diverge, with greater consequences for markets.

The air carrier estimates that a door-panel blowout in January and the subsequent plane groundings cost the company $160 million, primarily in lost revenue and other costs due to irregular operations. As a result, Alaska Air said it was paid $160 million in cash by Boeing during the first quarter. The company expects to receive additional compensation in future quarters, the terms of which are confidential. Alaska Air said the cash compensation was initially booked as earnings. But after further review of accounting standards and industry precedence, the compensation is now being accounted as a reduction to aircraft assets. Therefore, the company now expects an adjusted per-share loss of $1.15 to $1.05 for the first quarter, compared with a previous loss estimate of 55 cents to 45 cents and the FactSet loss consensus of 86 cents.

            "text": "\nGE Aerospace\n       is a premier player in commercial aviation. One analyst is bullish on the stock after the spinoff of the power-generation assets as \n        GE Vernova.\n The Vernova separation was completed on Tuesday. On Thursday, Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard launched coverage of the standalone aerospace company\u2019s stock with a Buy rating and $160 price target.  \u201cWhile the stock has been on a tear over the last year\u2026we think it is still the most appealing of the three mega-cap U.S. aerospace names,\u201d Stallard wrote in a report. \u201cIt has the largest and highest-quality exposure to the aerospace aftermarket, which we estimate generates about 80% of operating profit. Whilst there is still some non-core baggage and the valuation is lofty, we think the stock can still work from here.\u201d  Its jet engines power roughly three out of four commercial flights globally. Engine sellers, including GE, make more on parts and service than they do selling the original equipment to the likes of \n        Boeing\n       and \n        Airbus.\n GE Aero stock has certainly taken off; adjusted for the spin, it\u2019s up about 90% over the past 12 months coming into Thursday trading. Stallard\u2019s target works out to about 33 times his estimated 2025 adjusted earnings per share of $4.62. The \n        S&P 500\n       trades for less than 20 times 2025 earnings, but Stallard expects GE Aero earnings to grow at about 19% a year for the coming few years. S&P 500 earnings have grown at less than half that rate in recent years.  GE Aero stock is up 0.4% to $146.25 in premarket trading Thursday while S&P 500 and \n        Nasdaq Composite\n       futures are up 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. GE Aero stock gained 6.7% on Wednesday\u2014its second day as an independent company. Wall Street deserved some credit for that move.   With the Aero/Vernova separation complete, analysts are updating numbers and price targets for the aerospace company. On Wednesday, Barclays and Deutsche Bank updated their price targets to $175 and $190, respectively. Not all Street price targets have been adjusted for the spin, according to FactSet. The average of a handful of new targets reviewed by Barron\u2019s is roughly $165, up some 13% from recent levels.  More updates will be coming. The early updates show that Wall Street still likes shares of GE Aero. Most of the analysts updating numbers have Buy ratings. Just before the spin, 68% of analysts covering GE stock rated shares at Buy. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&P 500 is about 55%.

A survey of 2,422 businesses carried out by the BOE during March found that the average expected rise in wages eased to 4.9% from 5.2% in February. Those businesses reported that wages were 6.4% higher in the three months through March than in the same period a year earlier. Policy makers have highlighted the strength of recent wage growth as a key concern as they prepare to lower borrowing costs later this year. While the U.K.'s annual rate of consumer-price inflation is expected to hit the BOE's target of 2% during this quarter, that is largely due to a decline in home energy prices. Policy makers worry that after energy prices stabilize, rapidly rising wages could lead to a fresh pickup in inflation.

            "text": "By Anthony O. Goriainoff Ryanair Holdings said that it cancelled almost 950 flights in March due to disruption from the Israel-Hamas war, as the conflict continues to hit the airline's operations in the region. The Irish budget airline said Wednesday that it operated more than 77,000 flights in March, with passenger numbers up 8% on year to 13.6 million. Its load factor--a measure of how full a plane is--was flat at 93%. The airline has now cancelled around 5,430 flights since Hamas's Oct. 7 attack and operated more than 447,300. While the Israel-Hamas war has weighed on other airlines' operations in the region, it is rare for carriers to quantify the impact. A notable exception was Air France-KLM, which in February said that geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East and Africa, where a number of countries experienced military coups, had wiped out 65 million euros ($70 million) from its operating result in the fourth quarter. Ryanair has carried 183.7 million passengers over the 12 months to the end of March compared with 168.6 million for the comparable period a year earlier, and slightly more than its previous forecast of 183.5 million. It expects to make a post-tax profit for the year ended March 31, 2024, of between EUR1.85 billion to EUR1.95 billion. However it has previously said these forecasts are dependent upon avoiding adverse events such as the Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas conflict and further Boeing delivery delays. Shares at 0805 GMT are up 24 European cents, or 1.2%, at EUR20.77. They are currently up 43% over the past 12 months. Separately, eastern Europe-focused budget airline Wizz Air Holdings reported a 12% rise in passengers for March and said that it has restarted operations to Tel-Aviv, Israel, from six bases.

            "text": "\nBoeing\n       has put off designing an all-new, clean-sheet, single-aisle jet for a long, long time. The longer the company waits, the costlier the proposition becomes.  Boeing has its reasons. It has had a lot to deal with in recent years.  The 737 MAX jet\u2014modified from earlier 737 designs\u2014was grounded worldwide between March 2019 and November 2020, following two deadly crashes within five months. On Jan. 5 of this year, an emergency door plug blew out of a 737 MAX 9 jet operated by \n        Alaska Air.\n       The incident shook confidence in Boeing\u2019s manufacturing quality, leading to more oversight from the Federal Aviation Administration.  Another reason is cost. CEO Dave Calhoun estimates a new Boeing plane will cost $50 billion to develop. That money gets spent over, perhaps, a decade, but it is still a huge sum for the struggling company.  Through the MAX turmoil, Boeing has added some $40 billion in long-term debt. Annual free cash flow isn\u2019t expected to hit $10 billion until 2026 or 2027. Fixing current problems, including the balance sheet, before designing a new plan is a justifiable position for the company to take.  But waiting isn\u2019t a great option either. And it\u2019s costing the company market share.  \nAirbus\n      \u2019 A320neo family of jets is outselling the MAX family of jets. Airbus has taken in more than 10,000 orders for its newest A320 family. Boeing has accumulated less than 8,000 orders for MAX jets.  Airbus\u2019 larger A321neo has taken in more than 6,000 orders. The MAX 10\u2014the longest version of the 737 MAX\u2014has accumulated about 1,200 orders. The MAX 10 isn\u2019t certified for commercial flight yet.  The prior generation of single-aisle numbers looks different. Airbus sold about 8,000 of its older model A320 family jets. Boeing sold about 8,500 prior-generation 737 jets that overlap with Airbus products. Before the A320neo and the MAX, Boeing and Airbus split the single-aisle market.  Eventually, Boeing needs a new plane to staunch market share losses. Calhoun\u2019s number is a little scary. It might not be that bad. The last all-new plane Boeing developed was the 787 Dreamliner. The original cost of that program was supposed to be in the range of $5 billion. It ended up costing closer to $15 billion. With inflation, that number might be $25 billion today.  BofA Securities analyst Ron Epstein estimates a new single-aisle jet program would cost the company about $30 billion. That\u2019s a \u201creasonable estimate for the new program, assuming no major challenges,\u201d wrote the analyst in a Monday report.  That isn\u2019t Calhoun\u2019s $50 billion but not $15 billion or $25 billion either.  Calhoun\u2019s $50 billion and Epstein\u2019s $30 billion include all the development costs that go into a plane program including R&D, capital spending, and delays which are inevitable for almost every new plane program.  Calhoun is probably building in a buffer to temper expectations. Boeing didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment about his estimate.  The other thing a new plane program needs is time. Typically six to 10 years. Boeing better get started. The sooner the better.

            "text": "United Airlines\u00a0is asking its pilots to take time off in May because of delays in receiving new planes that the airline ordered from Boeing, which is struggling with production due to\u00a0manufacturing problems. A United \n        UAL,\n        -1.50%\n       spokesperson said Monday that the offer is voluntary. \u201cDue to the recent delays in Boeing deliveries, our forecasted (flight hours) have been reduced and we are offering our pilots voluntary programs for the month of May to reduce excess staffing,\u201d spokesperson Leslie Scott said. The Air Line Pilots Association said in a brief statement that United is offering short-term leaves and unpaid time off, but they are not mandatory. Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.33%\n      \u00a0declined to comment. United\u00a0doesn\u2019t expect to get all the Boeing jetliners it ordered and was due to receive this year or next year. A month ago, United said it was contractually due 191 planes this year and 127 next year, but expects to receive only 88 this year and 64 in 2025. Almost all of the shortfall consists of Boeing 737 Max planes, including a new, larger model. United had planned to begin flying 80 Max 10 jets this year. The Federal Aviation Administration has not yet certified the Max 10, however, and FAA approval is likely to be further delayed by increased scrutiny of Boeing since a panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines \nALK,\n        -1.32%\n       Max 9 in January. United is considering options to replace orders for the Max 10. Since the Alaska Airlines accident, federal regulators have been investigating production-quality issues at Boeing, and the FAA has barred Boeing from increasing production of 737 Max jets. United previously said that it\u00a0expects to lose money\u00a0in the first quarter because its Max 9s were grounded for inspections for three weeks after the blowout on the Alaska plane. The Chicago-based airline is scheduled to release financial results April 16. United CEO\u00a0Scott Kirby\u00a0is one of several airline executives who have called out problems at Boeing and sought a\u00a0meeting with Boeing directors. Boeing announced last week that CEO David Calhoun\u00a0will step down\u00a0at the end of the year as part of a leadership shakeup at the company. The head of Boeing\u2019s commercial-airplanes unit has already been replaced, and the chairman of the board will not stand for re-election in May.

            "text": "If you want to employ data when selecting stocks, you can look back to see how a company has performed, or you can look ahead at expected growth rates for sales, earnings or cash flow. You might also consider how expensive a stock is relative to expected sales, earnings or cash flow. You can also consider how analysts rate a stock. Analysts who work for brokerage firms will assign buy, sell or hold ratings to stocks, along with price targets. The analysts also estimate companies\u2019 revenue and profits. Each quarter, as companies announce their results, the financial media will report whether or not the companies have beaten or missed the estimates. Over time, it is good to see consensus estimates for a rolling 12-month period increase, as rising estimates can support rising share prices. But how good are analysts at selecting stocks for the long term? This isn\u2019t an easy question to answer, but we might begin with a simple performance comparison for a highly rated group of stocks with a group selected by looking back at performance data. Below is a look back at analysts\u2019 favorite stock picks among the S&P 500 \n        SPX\n       five years ago, showing how these selections have performed since then. For comparison, we will look at companies whose five-year average returns on invested capital were highest five years ago and see how that group has performed.  First, let\u2019s take a look at how analysts who work for brokerage firms, also known as sell-side analysts, rate companies for investment. One thing to keep in mind is that the custom in the industry is to set a 12-month price target, which may be a short period for a serious long-term investor. For example, shares of Microsoft Corp. \n        MSFT,\n        +2.63%\n       have returned 283% over the past five years through Friday, with dividends reinvested. But the stock dropped 28% during 2022 before roaring back 58% in 2023. From the end of 2021, Microsoft has returned \u201conly\u201d 14%. Then again, the S&P 500 has returned 3% since the end of 2021, while the index\u2019s five-year return has been 85%. All of this serves to illustrate why it may be best for a long-term investor to think about committing for many years, rather than focusing on 12-month targets. Now let\u2019s consider the ratings. A quick look at the S&P 500 shows that ratings skew positive. Among the 500 companies, 54% have majority buy or equivalent ratings among analysts polled by FactSet. But there are no companies with majority sell or equivalent ratings and only three with 50% sell ratings: T. Rowe Price Group Inc. \n        TROW,\n        +5.19%,\n       Robert Half Inc. \n        RHI,\n        -1.95%\n       and Expeditors International of Washington Inc. \n        EXPD,\n        +0.76%.\n On March 14, there were 74 companies in the S&P 500 with at least 75% buy ratings among analysts polled by FactSet. Combining that with a look at the price targets generated this list of 20 favorite stocks among the analysts.  Starting with the current S&P 500, we can look at the ratings and consensus price targets five years ago to see which companies Wall Street analysts favored at that time.  To begin, among the current S&P 500, 484 companies were rated by at least five analysts polled by FactSet as of March 22, 2019. Among those 484 companies, there were 80 rated a buy or the equivalent by at least 75% of the analysts. Among those 80, these 10 had the highest upside potential implied by consensus price targets at that time: Five of these companies have outperformed the S&P 500\u2019s 85% return over the past five years, which really isn\u2019t bad. One of the companies, Tapestry Inc. \n        TPR,\n        +1.94%,\n       had a total return of 75%, and none had negative returns.  Even professional portfolio managers might be happy to have half of their selections work out well, while moving on from underperformers.  Last month we took a very long look back and saw a close correlation between outperforming the S&P 500 and having high returns on invested capital.  A company\u2019s return on invested capital, or ROIC, is its net income divided by the sum of the carrying value of its common stock, preferred stock, long-term debt and capitalized lease obligations. This is an annualized figure that highlights how efficient a company\u2019s management team has been at allocating investors\u2019 money. Some industries will naturally have higher ROIC than others because they are less capital-intensive. Others that have managed to avoid raising additional money to operate their businesses \u2014 such as Apple Inc. \n        AAPL,\n        +0.04%\n       \u2014 while buying back shares to lower their share count (and their invested capital) will have high or rising ROIC over the years. FactSet calculates companies\u2019 ROIC each fiscal quarter, using a look back at the previous four quarters. So ROIC is always an annualized figure for a rolling 12 months. For a five-year ROIC screen as of March 22, 2019, we began once again with the current S&P 500. We looked at FactSet\u2019s ROIC figures as of that date and then looked back four fiscal quarters, then eight quarters and so on, to have five 12-month ROIC snapshots for our five-year averages. These 10 companies in the S&P 500 had the highest five-year ROIC as of March 22, 2019. The table also includes ratings summaries as of that date and five-year returns through Friday: On this ROIC-selected list, six of 10 companies outperformed the S&P 500 through Friday, while one, HP Inc. \n        HPQ,\n        -0.30%,\n       was close behind, with an 83% return. But VeriSign Inc. \n        VRSN,\n        -3.04%,\n       which had the highest ROIC, was the second-worst performer on the list and did far worse than any company on the first list of analysts\u2019 favorites from five years ago. And shares of Boeing Co. \n        BA,\n        +0.33%\n       were down 47% for five years through Friday, while the worst performer on the analysts\u2019 list, Humana Inc., had a positive return of 32% for five years. Other observations about the data: In conclusion, the ROIC analytical method would have worked out better when judged by the number of winners, but the analysts\u2019 list would have turned out to be safer. Both approaches can be useful.

Chief Executive David Calhoun will step down at the end of the year, a change at the top that is not going to immediately fix the issues at the troubled aerospace giant, which needs to shake up its financially driven culture and get back to its engineering roots. Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.34%\n       is now embarking on a difficult search for a new CEO \u2014 someone who can work with federal regulators, inspire employees and return the company\u2019s once-vaunted manufacturing back to world class.  The timeline of Calhoun\u2019s departure doesn\u2019t communicate enough urgency, but it could help in the search for a successor.  \u201cAnnouncing a change nine months in advance is useful from a succession-planning perspective but does not signal any perceived need for urgency,\u201d said Jo-Ellen Pozner, associate professor of management and entrepreneurship at Santa Clara University\u2019s Leavey School of Business. \u201cIf Boeing understood the problems the market perceives with its current leadership, it would have named an external successor with significant manufacturing and operations experience.\u201d While it is a difficult question as to whether Boeing should look internally or outside the company for Calhoun\u2019s successor, the best possible candidate is likely to come from the outside, if only because Boeing\u2019s current corporate culture has been in place too long.  \u201cGiven what observers now recognize as a dire need for a change in mindset\u00a0within Boeing, an outsider is likely to be much better received,\u201d Pozner said. Boeing did not give any details or immediately respond to questions about its CEO succession plans. Read: Boeing\u2019s outgoing CEO David Calhoun got millions in extra awards just a year ago In addition to announcing Calhoun\u2019s departure, Boeing appointed Chief Operating Officer Stephanie Pope as president and CEO of its commercial airplanes division, effectively immediately. Pope was the former CFO of the division she now leads, from December 2020 to March 2022. \u201cPope is an accountant and comptroller,\u201d  said Matt Moscardi, a founder of Free Float LLC, an analytics service of corporate boards and directors. \u201cBoeing doesn\u2019t have an accounting problem or a cost savings problem. They have a safety and culture problem.\u201d\u00a0  Bill George, former chairman and CEO of Medtronic and now executive fellow at Harvard Business School, wrote in a recent article for Harvard Business School that Boeing\u2019s current problems are due to \u201da leadership failure that has allowed cultural drift away from Boeing\u2019s once-vaunted engineering quality.\u201d Those problems have been widely attributed to how the company\u2019s culture changed and became far more financially focused after its merger with McDonnell Douglas in 1997. Harry Stonecipher, a former GE executive, came out of retirement to lead the merged company after an ethics scandal caused the departure of then-CEO Phil Condit. \u201cHe [Stonecipher] said we are not going to be an engineering firm. We are going to be run like a business,\u201d George said. \u201cThat was insulting to people. That really demoralized a lot of the engineers.\u201d Instead, Boeing focused on maximizing profits on older models and used its cash for share buybacks. \n\u201cBoeing is feeling the financial impact of the recent grounding of its 737-Max planes.\u201d\n Now, Boeing is feeling the financial impact of the recent grounding of its 737-Max planes. Its Chief Financial Officer Brian West told a BofA conference last week that Boeing\u2019s cash flow will take a hit of between $4 billion to $4.5 billion in the current quarter. Since the beginning of January, its shares have lost about 30%, and the company has once again been the target of shareholder lawsuits.  Attempting to restore Boeing\u2019s engineering culture will be a tough job that will take years, and the company has already waited too long to get  started.  In addition, Boeing\u2019s board of directors should also see a shakeup, where its members that don\u2019t have any engineering or manufacturing experience step down.  \u201cThose folks have sway at the board level,\u201d Pozner said. \u201cIf discussions at the board level are focused on shareholder value, that trickles down to the rest of the organization.\u201d No one wants Boeing to fail or fall further behind. But the company needs a further shakeup, with even bigger moves, so that real, measurable change can begin. \u201cIt takes years. You don\u2019t do this overnight,\u201d said George last week, before Monday\u2019s news. \u201cThe board has to take that position.\u201d Moscati, the corporate board analyst, was even more blunt: \u201cThe problem with Boeing is they removed the people who had the skills to build and engineer planes from positions of power. They need to meet the Airbus \n        AIR,\n        -0.92%\n       challenge \u2014 finding engineers who can run a company.\u201d More: Replacing Boeing CEO Calhoun won\u2019t be easy.

            "text": "Corporate scandals have a tendency to refocus us all on questions of corporate culture and governance, and Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.38%\n       is no exception. David Calhoun is the latest of a spate of CEOs to step down in disgrace, his fall cushioned by the usual golden parachute.  This couldn\u2019t be much more predictable. When Calhoun was hired in 2020, he was promised a $7 million bonus, directly linked to returning the 737 Max to the skies. As U.S. Sens. Edward Markey, Richard Blumenthal and Tammy Baldwin commented in a letter to Boeing\u2019s board at the time, \u201cThis payment represents a clear financial incentive for Mr. Calhoun to pressure regulators into ungrounding the 737 Max, as well as rush the investigations and reforms needed to guarantee public safety.\u201d While some have been keen to frame Boeing\u2019s problems as a consequence of its DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) efforts, this argument is wildly unconvincing. What Boeing\u2019s problems actually illustrate is that despite corporations adding more women and minorities to boards and C-suites over the past several years, conformity of thought and the strength of social ties are more powerful. The actual problem isn\u2019t a lack of controls, visibility or knowledge. Rather, it is group dynamics. Nell Minow, a leading corporate governance specialist, has decades of experience directly observing board dynamics. She has this to say about boardroom groupthink: \u201cWe take these people of extraordinary ability and achievement. We put them in a boardroom, and there they suddenly become totally incompetent. Why is that? My answer is that these are people who have a genius for sizing up the norms of the room and adapting to them. And that\u2019s a fabulous quality to have. But unfortunately, you\u2019ve got 11 people like that \u2014 and one very visionary, dynamic leader who controls their information, their access to other people in the organization, and even their tenure and their compensation. That\u2019s not a good system.\u201d Board selection criteria vary, but while efforts have been made to increase the independence of board members, personal and social connections still predominate. Many studies demonstrate that members tend to have similar backgrounds, political affiliations and even religious beliefs. Bonding on the golf course remains a hallowed professional practice. At Boeing, its 2021 $246 million fine did lead to the addition of aviation and safety experts to the board, and 30% of its directors are women. But neither factor is enough to offset the complex web of connections, relationships and loyalties between its members.\u00a0 How is it that as Boeing and other companies have diversified in such areas as gender and race, they seem not to have diversified their perspectives, or become any better at preventing ethical scandals? \u201cMeta-analyses of rigorous, peer-reviewed studies found no significant relationships \u2014 causal or otherwise \u2014 between board gender diversity and company performance,\u201d Robin J. Ely, a Harvard Business School professor, and David A. Thomas, president of Morehouse College, wrote in 2020. \u201cHaving people from various identity groups \u2018at the table\u2019 is no guarantee that anything will get better.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u201cSenior leadership was almost 64% less likely to speak up against unethical practices than the most junior employees were.\u201d\n Jessica Kennedy\u2019s research has shed further light on Minow\u2019s observations about how boards often seem ineffective when it comes to ethical oversight. Before Kennedy became a professor in management at Vanderbilt University, her work as an investment banker exposed her to numerous dysfunctional corporate hierarchies. Kennedy has conducted a number of studies to explore what she had repeatedly witnessed: Greater seniority leads to higher identification with your group. Ethical issues in particular cause cognitive dissonance, leading people to rationalize or minimize problems. This means that the more senior you are, the more likely you are to justify what the group is already doing \u2014 for better or worse. Her study of 11,000 employees across U.S. government agencies found that senior leadership was almost 64% less likely to speak up against unethical practices than the most junior employees were. Even if leaders created the very systems they oversee, they become products of them over time. This means that good leaders should be on guard that power will directly affect their judgment and moral compass; they should strive to build strong ethical structures from the start.  \n\u201cEfforts to solicit dissenting views from more junior employees should be deemed a priority.\u201d\n It also means that making efforts to solicit dissenting views from more junior employees should be deemed a priority, not a risky move best postponed or avoided. One useful mechanism to consider: Give a group of younger employees and executives an assignment to innovate and challenge the existing board.\u00a0 Improved deliberation is certainly an asset, but a healthy group dynamic is needed to achieve the greatest advantage. Curiosity, critical thinking and willingness to challenge an accepted perspective \u2014 particularly a monolithic one \u2014 is where diversity and inclusion imperatives really drive more considered and ethical decision-making.\u00a0 So far, this is still missing at Boeing. Until the company appreciates that safety is non-negotiable for all stakeholders, from investors to customers, Boeing will have to keep digging. A new CEO will not help. What is needed at Boeing is an entirely new mindset on core corporate-governance topics. Alison Taylor\u00a0is a clinical associate professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business and the executive director of Ethical Systems, where her research focuses on ethics and business responsibility. She is the author of\u00a0Higher Ground: How Business Can Do the Right Thing in a Turbulent World\u00a0(Harvard Business Review Press, 2024).

            "text": "\n\u201cBy several accounts, this long-overdue reckoning resulted from a revolt by the company\u2019s airline customers.\u201d\n This was Boeing\u2019s best week in many years.\u00a0A dysfunctional management team was ousted. President and CEO David Calhoun will step down at the end of the year. Board chairman Larry Kellner announced that he would not stand for reelection. Stan Deal, CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, left the company immediately.\u00a0  By several accounts, this long-overdue reckoning resulted from a revolt by the company\u2019s airline customers, concerned about missed production plans, uncertain new model-certification schedules, and high-profile incidents resulting from manufacturing \u201cquality escapes.\u201d Now comes the hard part. Getting Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.37%\n       back on track will take years, maybe decades. Here\u2019s what to watch for as the company tries to restore itself to health: 1. Who gets the top job? Calhoun, like 2005-2015 CEO Jim McNerney, was a Jack Welch-era General Electric \n        GE,\n        +0.94%\n       alumni with a background in finance, and little else. Boeing needs someone less focused on financial abstractions and more focused on the hard work of running an airplane company. An engineering degree and program management experience would be a plus, along with a propensity for visiting factories and understanding resource needs.\u00a0Ironically, Spirit AeroSystems \n        SPR,\n        +2.17%\n       CEO Pat Shanahan, a Boeing veteran, would be a great choice, but there certainly are other solid candidates. Another thing to watch for is Calhoun\u2019s retirement. There is no reason for him to remain as CEO for the next eight months, and there are many reasons for him to not be part of the CEO selection process. 2. Who gets the other top job? Putting Stephanie Pope in charge of the Commercial unit may be a short-term measure, intended to stabilize a difficult situation in the aftermath of Deal\u2019s departure.\u00a0If she\u2019s a long-term appointment, that would be very concerning.\u00a0Her background is finance, just like Calhoun and McNerney, with no technical background and zero experience in jetliner design, development or manufacturing. If both the company and unit CEO positions are filled by non-engineers, that would be disastrous. In fact, the only time that\u2019s happened in Boeing\u2019s history was in 2012-2015. That\u2019s when the 737 MAX was developed, and certainly a low point in terms of company engineers having access to managerial authority. \n\u201cQuestions should be asked, and more people with aviation experience need to be appointed to the board.\u201d\n 3. The board needs a refresh: McNerney packed the board with rubber-stamping supporters and random celebrities, with very few engineering or technical degrees among them.\u00a0Calhoun was a board member since 2009, providing zero oversight in a worsening situation.\u00a0While a few new and more qualified members joined in recent years, there is the big question about their oversight, or lack thereof, in the past year or so, when things went off the rails.\u00a0Who was protecting Calhoun despite the very wrong path the company was on? Removing Kellner is a good first step, but questions should be asked, and more people with aviation experience need to be appointed. 4. Change the culture: Southwest Airlines \n        LUV,\n        -0.26%\n       founder Herb Kelleher said, \u201cYour employees come first. And if you treat your employees right, guess what? Your customers come back, and that makes your shareholders happy.\u201d  Boeing\u2019s management reversed that order: they were obsessed with financial returns, while assets like technologies, products and, most of all, the workforce were barely priorities at all. The embarrassing litany of failed 737 MAX production goals resulted from executives who wanted the cash associated with jet deliveries, but didn\u2019t understand the resource needs associated with building those jets. They also didn\u2019t have the connections with the workforce needed to understand what was needed and what was possible. The new management team needs to change this. They need a transformation every bit as profound as the transformation of General Electric from the old Jack Welch culture to the new GE, under Larry Culp.\u00a0 In fact, Culp would be an inspired choice for Boeing CEO. As part of this process, and as part of the board refresh, it would be a great sign if Boeing gave one board seat to the unions. It could alternate between the engineers and the machinists. 5. Recruit the veterans: There\u2019s a remarkable diaspora of former Boeing people with tremendous expertise in design and production.\u00a0Incredibly, there\u2019s been no outreach to them over the past few years, despite Boeing\u2019s increasingly dire situation. They need to be brought in as consultants whenever possible. \n\u201cStart talking about a new jet, and the enabling technologies, with an eye on launching it within two years.\u201d\n 6. Develop a new jet: In November 2022, Calhoun announced that the company wouldn\u2019t introduce a new aircraft this decade, despite a massive competitive disadvantage against Airbus \n        AIR,\n        -0.92%\n       in the middle market (200-240 seats).\u00a0Predictably, 2023 saw a record 1,300-plus orders for the middle market A321neo. Airlines had no choice but to take his announcement seriously, despite the damage it was doing to Boeing\u2019s position.\u00a0Engineers took it seriously too, and had few reasons to join an engineering company with no plans to do anything new. The answer is simple: Start talking about a new jet, and the enabling technologies, with an eye on launching it within two years.\u00a0In addition to getting Boeing\u2019s market share back to 50%, introducing a new jet would attract new talent and galvanize a demoralized engineering workforce. \n\u201cThe recent decades have been a master class in mismanagement.\u201d\n 7. Bring back strategy. In November 2023 Calhoun abolished the company\u2019s strategy department. Business unit strategy functions were gutted too.\u00a0Bringing these capabilities back would be an excellent sign. This too is simple. A company with a future should have a strategy, and a way of allocating capital among business units. Again, the road back for Boeing will be long.\u00a0The recent decades have been a master class in mismanagement: a systematic neglect of what made the company great, with a single-minded focus on extracting cash.\u00a0Per Oscar Wilde, they knew the price of everything and the value of nothing. Strangely, this unpleasant reality implies hope. Boeing has many strong attributes \u2014 its products, its suppliers, its technologies, its people and its global presence.\u00a0It\u2019s in a global duopoly with high-entry barriers, and customers that eagerly want its products. The only thing missing was competent management.\u00a0With good leadership, the company\u2019s many virtues can be unleashed.

            "text": "Donald Trump said it would be difficult for him to post a $454 million bond while appealing a fraud conviction and celebrated on Monday when the amount was lowered to $175 million on appeal.   But the former president\u2019s need for cash may be dwarfed by his profit following the merger of his social-media platform with Digital World Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. \n        DJT,\n        +10.00%\n       began trading under their new \u201cDJT\u201d ticker Tuesday, and closed at $61.96 Thursday \u2014 up 68% from a week earlier.  Based on Trump\u2019s reported stake of 78,750,000 shares, his stock in the combined company was worth $4.88 billon at Thursday\u2019s close. A market capitalization of $8.84 billion for a company that has generated only about $5 million in revenue makes DJT the definition of a meme stock. Lukas I. Alpert looked into this phenomenon and explained why Trump himself may have a hard time cashing in at anywhere near the current valuation for his shares.  Investors\u2019 enthusiasm for DJT, as well as for Reddit, which completed its IPO last week, raises the obvious question of whether or not we are looking at a signal that the stock market is near a top. This is when the words \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d come to the fore. So Mark Hulbert compared this year\u2019s IPO and related action to previous market cycles, and came to this conclusion. More on the Trump merger and its aftermath: The S&P 500 \n        SPX\n       has rallied 26% since the end of October, with dividends reinvested. Even a strong trend for the stock market has its periodic pullbacks. Joseph Adinolfi explained that typically the catalyst for a market correction is one of these three things.

Stock of spinoff companies sometimes trade before the actual spinoff, giving investors clues to valuation. Vernova began trading at $115, near expectations, and rose to $136.75 on the week. On Wednesday, Wells Fargo analyst Matthew Akers lifted his GE stock price target from $177 to $200 a share, which included $34 a share for Vernova. GE shareholders get one share of Vernova for every four GE shares; given that, Akers calculated a $136 target for Vernova, near the top of Wall Street valuations.  At $136, Vernova trades at 12 times projected 2025 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, a bit higher than the average multiple for peers such as \n        Siemens Energy,\nHubbell,\nVestas Wind Systems,\n       and \n        Schneider Electric.\n       Individual multiples range widely: Schneider trades for 15 times 2025 estimated Ebitda, \n        Siemens\n       for four. Vernova includes a money-losing wind business and a more stable gas-powered turbine unit. Profitability should improve, which makes picking a multiple based on 2024 or 2025 estimates tricky.

The request goes into detail in seeking internal discussions around Spirit\u2019s efforts to create a diverse workforce \u201cand whether those commitments are unlawful or are compromising the company\u2019s manufacturing processes.\u201d Paxton asked for a breakdown of Spirit\u2019s workforce by race, sexual orientation and other factors, and whether the makeup has changed over time.

Paxton did not admit wrongdoing in the nine-year-old case. The Federal Aviation Administration launched an investigation into Boeing and Spirit after the Alaska Airlines incident.

Travelers are already facing higher airline baggage fees this summer but capacity cuts due to Boeing\u2019s troubles mean elevated airfares are also likely to hit passengers\u2019 pockets. Airline capacity, or the number of flights taking to the skies, is a reliable driver of ticket prices. The more flights people have to choose from, the lower the price and vice versa. Higher maintenance costs, as a result of more older planes remaining in fleets, also have the potential to add upward pressure to fares. Several carriers, including \n        Southwest Airlines,\nRyanair,\n       and \n        Alaska Air\n       are set to cut capacity growth because of uncertainty over deliveries from Boeing. The Federal Aviation Administration has increased its oversight of United Airlines following several safety incidents and the carrier faces potential restrictions on new routes and new planes. The industry\u2019s previously aggressive capacity growth plans for the year pointed to some relief for passengers on fares but that may not now be the case.\u00a0 \nAlaska Air\n       said Thursday that its capacity growth will likely be below the lower end of its 4% to 8% target range, with part of that stemming from the temporary grounding of the 737 MAX 9. \u201cThe entire industry is growing domestic capacity at a much slower rate,\u201d it added in an annual report to shareholders.  The airline said earlier this month its full-year capacity plans were in \u201cflux\u201d due to Boeing\u2019s delivery problems. In January the carrier said it may miss its earlier annual target for 3% to 5% capacity growth. Airlines fares fell 6.1% in February compared with the previous year, according to the latest consumer price index (CPI), but they rose 3.6% from January. The average cost of round-trip ticket flying domestically in February was $573, up from $546 in January, and the highest in a year, according to Airlines Reporting Corporation. Its data differ from CPI and puts February\u2019s average fare at the same levels as February 2023. The summer travel period, which is typically booked several months in advance, will be the real test for fares as that\u2019s when the industry\u2019s capacity changes are likely to take effect.\u00a0 Irish low-cost carrier \n        Ryanair\n       has been more explicit about the impact of Boeing\u2019s delivery delays on ticket prices\u2014passengers could be paying up to 10% more. The airline, a major Boeing customer, said earlier this month it expects to receive just 40 of the 57 planned 737 MAX 8-200 that were due to be delivered by the end of June. As the carrier\u2019s schedule was predicated on obtaining at least 50 of the 737 MAX jets, it has been forced to cut capacity over the summer months.\u00a0 \u201cWe expect these latest Boeing delivery delays, which regrettably are beyond Ryanair\u2019s control, combined with the grounding of up to 20% of our \n        Airbus\n       competitors\u2019 A320 fleets in Europe, will lead to more constrained capacity and slightly higher airfares for consumer in Europe in summer 2023,\u201d CEO Michael O\u2019Leary said in early March. Closer to home, \n        Southwest Airlines\n       is also cutting capacity this year by at least one percentage point from 2023 due to Boeing\u2019s challenges. The airline said Boeing told it to expect 46 deliveries of the 737 MAX-8 plane in 2024, compared with the 79 previously expected. With most U.S. airlines also hiking baggage fees by around $5 per bag, it isn\u2019t going to be a cheap summer of travel.

            "text": "The three major stock indexes recorded a strong first quarter, with the \n        Dow Jones Industrial Average\n       gaining 5.6%, the \n        S&P 500\n       rising 10.2%, and the \n        Nasdaq 100\n       increasing 8.5%.  The Dow gained 2,117.83 points this quarter to close at 39,807.37, a new record close and its 17th record close this year, according to Dow Jones Market Data.  The S&P gained 484.52 points this quarter to close at 5,254.35, also a record close, and its 22nd record close this year. The Nasdaq composite closed at 16379.46, its fifth highest close ever. The moves have been driven in part by the ongoing artificial intelligence frenzy. One AI stock really has shined in the first three months of the year. These stocks were the best performing and worst performing in the first quarter of 2024.\u00a0 \nWalt Disney\n       was the top performer stock in the blue chip index in the first quarter, rising 35.5%. The gain was the largest quarter-to-date increase for the stock since December 2020. Disney has had a rocky couple of years as the entertainment giant experienced issues like high streaming costs, weakened box office performances, and the shift away from traditional, linear TV. Investors have called for internal change, and now the House of Mouse is in the middle of a board fight with activists including Trian Group\u2019s Nelson Peltz. But the company, which was a Barron\u2019s stock pick in July 2023, has shown signs of strength in recent months, helping to push the stock higher. Disney reported better-than-expected profit for its December quarter and provided earnings guidance above analysts\u2019 estimates. Earlier this month, CEO Bob Iger said Disney was on track to beat its 2024 free cash flow guidance and was working to lower costs. \nBoeing\n       was the worst performer in the Dow during the first quarter. The shares tumbled 26%, notching their worst quarter since June 2022. It\u2019s been a turbulent few months for the airplane maker, to say the least. After an emergency door plug blew out of a 737 MAX 9 operated by \n        Alaska Air\n       inflight, eyebrows were raised over the quality of \n        Boeing\u2019s\n       manufacturing procedures, and the Federal Aviation Administration tightened regulations. Despite the list of challenges, however, Wall Street remains positive, with 66% of analysts covering the company rating shares at Buy, according to FactSet.\u00a0 Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, meanwhile, announced earlier this week that he was stepping down at the end of 2024. \nSuper Micro Computer\n       has started its first quarter in the S&P 500 with a bang. Shares of the server maker have jumped 255.3% this year as investors continue to bet on the future of generative artificial intelligence. Super Micro joined the S&P 500 on March 18. Some analysts have argued that AI hype already has been priced into the shares, but J.P. Morgan\u2019s Samik Chatterjee initiated coverage of the stock with an Overweight rating and a $1,150 price target on Monday. \u201cWe expect the leadership to continue, led by a balance of custom built solutions and fast time to market, although potential upside is more likely from rapid expansion in the AI Server market rather than expansion of the already premium valuation multiple,\u201d Chatterjee wrote. \nTesla\n       was the worst performer in the S&P 500 in the first quarter, with shares dropping 29.3%, their worst quarter since December 2022. The electric-vehicle maker has struggled with competition and slowing demand.\u00a0 In January, \n        Tesla\n       reported worse-than-expected earnings, and management said automotive sales growth in 2024 would be substantially below last year\u2019s. Then, earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company was cutting production at its Shanghai plant to five days a week from six-and-a-half days, likely illustrating a downturn in demand.\u00a0 \nNvidia\n       continues to shine, and was the best-performing stock in the Nasdaq 100 in the first quarter after gaining 82.5%. The stock jumped 16% alone on Feb. 22, after the chip maker reported earnings and revenue above Wall Street\u2019s consensus and provided a strong revenue outlook. \nNvidia\n       stock has been one of, if not the No. 1 beneficiary of investor enthusiasm over generative AI. The company makes chips that help power the hot tech for many major companies like \n        Meta Platforms\n       and \n        Amazon.com.\n      \u00a0 \nTesla\n       was also the worst performer in the Nasdaq 100 in the first quarter, with its 29.3% drop just edging out \n        Sirius XM Holdings\n      \u2019 29.1% decline.   \nSirius XM\n       is expected to close its merger with Liberty Sirius XM in the third quarter, and Warren Buffet has been buying the tracking stock.\u00a0 Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.com and Emily Dattilo at emily.dattilo@dowjones.com Buying stocks after the \u201cfinal rate hike\u201d in a cycle demands perfect timing.

            "text": "\nBoeing\n       stock still has a lot of support on Wall Street. Analysts believe things can turn out well for the airplane maker as long as many things go right.  \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough year for Boeing\u2019s stock,\u201d wrote Citi analyst Jason Gursky in a Thursday report. Coming into Thursday trading Boeing stock was off about 26% year to date. \u201dAs such, we review the long thesis to provide context on where we\u2019ve been and where we\u2019re headed.\u201d  Where we\u2019ve been is easy to summarize. An emergency door plug blew out of a 737 MAX 9 operated by \n        Alaska Air\n       in flight. The incident shook confidence in Boeing\u2019s quality and manufacturing procedures leading to more oversight from the Federal Aviation Administration and slower plane production.  The FAA has capped Boeing\u2019s MAX production at 38 jets a month until the agency is satisfied with manufacturing improvement. Boeing, however, is delivering jets well below that rate. It is on pace to deliver about 60 MAX jets in the first quarter, according to Wall Street tracking, which is below the 80-plus jets Wall Street expected.  \u201cThe fundamental outlook for commercial aerospace and Boeing has not changed\u2014demand for new aircraft remains robust and there are only two major competitors that can fulfill it,\u201d wrote Gursky. \u201cExecution is thus key, and on this front, Boeing has stumbled but we don\u2019t think that\u2019s a permanent state.\u201d  What\u2019s more, some of the things that have weighed on investor sentiment will eventually become positives, he says. The FAA will eventually raise the production cap, a new CEO will be named, \n        Spirit AeroSystems\n       will likely be merged with Boeing, giving the company more control over manufacturing.  CEO Dave Calhoun announced earlier this week he is stepping down at the end of the year. A successor hasn\u2019t been named. \u201cAn outsider with a strong engineering and manufacturing pedigree\u201d would be a positive, Gursky writes.  He sees a renewed focus on quality as a good thing and while fixing its reputation and balance sheet will take time\u2014Boeing has added some $38 billion in long-term debt over the past few years\u2014he recommends building positions in the stock now. Gursky\u2019s rating is Buy and his price target is $252 a share.  He isn\u2019t alone in his views. Wall Street has stayed bullish throughout the recent crisis.  Overall, 66% of analysts covering the stock rate shares Buy. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the \n        S&P 500\n       is about 55%. The average analyst price target for Boeing stock is about $249 a share. The average analyst price target is up about $14 over the past year, despite Boeing\u2019s recent quality and manufacturing problems.   To be sure, not everyone agrees. CFRA analyst Stewart Glickman cut his price target by $8 to $164 on Wednesday. He rates shares Sell.  \u201dIt is too early to determine when that [FAA production] slowdown may end,\u201d wrote the analyst. \u201cBoeing has a long road ahead of it to restore its reputation for engineering quality.\u201d  Boeing shares are down 0.2% in premarket trading.

            "text": "With CEO Dave Calhoun leaving, Wall Street is feverishly trying to decide who\u2019s best to run \n        Boeing\n       amid quality and production problems that have caused customers, regulators\u2014and the flying public\u2014to lose a measure of confidence in the American aviation giant.  Right now, analysts want an outsider with engineering and manufacturing expertise. That\u2019s the consensus opinion based on Barron\u2019s queries. Is it the right call though?  There is just no way to know\u2014yet.  \u201cA change in senior management is a good first step in addressing the company\u2019s myriad of problems,\u201d wrote Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard in a Monday report. \u201dBut the major piece\u2026missing from the puzzle is who will be the next CEO?\u201d\u00a0 History offers no help. Boeing has had CEOs from inside and outside the company with varying backgrounds who have met with varying degrees of success.  Trying to discern who is best to run Boeing, who gets credit for past successes, and who deserves the blame for failures is like untangling the Gordian knot.  Notable outsiders include Harry Stonecipher and James McNerney. Stonecipher was an engineer with deep roots in the aerospace business. He ran McDonnell Douglas at the time of its merger with Boeing. McNerney was a Harvard M.B.A. with a management pedigree from Jack Welch\u2019s \n        General Electric\n       who had completed a stint running \n        3M.\n Looking at the years both served, Boeing stock did well under both. Stonecipher\u2019s tenure was relatively short while McNerney served for about a decade.  McNerney was replaced by the engineer insider Dennis Muilenburg who was then replaced by Calhoun\u2014a former GE executive with an accounting degree. Shares soared under Muilenburg who left shortly after two tragic 737 MAX crashes. Calhoun returned the MAX to service, but shares have fallen some 40% during his tenure. Muilenburg\u2019s tenure spanned four years. Calhoun, who announced he is stepping down on Monday, will serve almost five as CEO.  Insider, outsider, engineer, businessman, long tenure, short tenure\u2014no rhyme or reason from the past points former \n        Qualcomm\n       CEO Steve Mollenkopf\u2014who is leading the CEO search\u2014which direction to go in.  Compounding the problem, aviation assets and programs span generations. The 747 made its first flight in 1969. Boeing delivered the last one in 2023. It will probably fly for another 20 years. Including aircraft development\u2014overseen by CEO William Allen\u2014the entire program will span more than 80 years.  Is the 747 a product of Allen\u2019s leadership? Or maybe Thornton Wilson deserves the credit. He ran Boeing from 1969 to 1986.   However the CEO search ends, investors should be slow to declare victory or groan when they learn the name of the next Boeing chief.  GE CEO Larry Culp took his share of criticism from the Street in 2018 when he took over the struggling icon. Analysts questioned whether the former CEO of \n        Danaher,\n       an industrial/healthcare conglomerate, could run a company building\u2014and financing\u2014huge machines costing millions and ordered years in advance.  He did fine. Now analysts cite Culp when thinking about an ideal Boeing CEO. Wall Street credits his lean manufacturing expertise with helping fix GE. Lean manufacturing has its roots in statistical process control and continuous improvement. It\u2019s the kind of think that a company struggling with production seems to need.  Anyone spending some time with Culp realizes his passion for lean is real.  Right now the betting odds for Boeing\u2019s next CEO favor \n        Spirit AeroSystems\n       CEO Patrick Shanahan. He is a combination insider-outsider with an engineering background. Shanahan was brought in to help fix Spirit AeroSystems recently. Before that, he worked in the Defense Department after spending decades at Boeing.  COO Stephanie Pope is another candidate from inside the company. She just took the reigns of Boeing Commercial Airplanes after Stan Deal resigned. Deal took over for Kevin McAllister who resigned in 2019 after the tragic MAX crashes.  Ashley Fulmer, assistant professor at Georgia State\u2019s Robinson College of Business, argues that whoever Boeing picks they must prioritize the company\u2019s long-term health over short-term results.  Easier said than done. Still, after the most recent two CEOs didn\u2019t last five years before the board announced changes, \u201cthey need someone not so concerned with losing their job,\u201d says Dr. Fulmer.  Her research focuses on trust in organizations. \u201cBoeing\u00a0needs to think about relationships they have with the public and customers,\u201d adds Fulmer. \u201cThe way they have been communicating [lately] has not been helping them.\u201d  With the stock down more than 55% from highs reached in March 2019, investors should be ready to accept short-term pain. At this point, they just want to hear a coherent plan for improvement.

The U.K. North Sea oil and gas operator said Wednesday that under the deal being discussed, Eni would transfer all of its U.K. upstream assets, including the recently acquired Neptune Energy assets in exchange for the shares. Eni granted Ithaca a four-week exclusivity period over the assets to enable the companies to progress the contracts for a deal. Ithaca said that if the deal goes ahead it would boost the company's near-term cash flows to unlock growth from its development projects, while supporting shareholder returns. The company would also have access to Eni's technical expertise to drive future growth. Eni's U.K. assets had produced 40,000 to 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day and had and reserves of around 100 million barrels at Dec. 31. Ithaca said any deal will need to be approved by shareholders, adding that the U.K. Takeover panel has granted a dispensation under Rule 9 that requires a majority shareholder to launch a mandatory offer. Eni didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Dow Jones Newswires. Ithaca shares at 1035 GMT were up 3.4 pence, or 2.4%, at 145.60 pence but are currently down 1.4% over the past 12 months.

Goriainoff Ithaca Energy reported a drop in profit after booking an impairment in its accounts and on a profit boost the year before. The U.K. North Sea-focused oil-and-gas company made a net profit for 2023 of $215.6 million compared with $1.03 billion a year earlier. The decline reflected a $557.9 million impairment on the development and production of its assets in 2023 as well as a $1.3 billion gain the year before.

            "text": "Travelers flying now are nervously checking to see if they are booked on a \n        Boeing\n       jet.  If the jet was made by another company, they probably feel some relief, just as there is likely some anxiety over traveling on the jet of a damaged company that seems unable to fix its many problems, ranging from safety to corporate culture.  Boeing\u2019s reputation is so bad that the company\u2019s stock ticker, BA, might as well stand for Broken Airplanes. It recently announced that it was looking for another chief executive. Dave Calhoun, the current CEO, will step down at year\u2019s end after only four years at the helm, among other senior management departures. The board chairman will also be leaving.  Given Boeing\u2019s many challenges, some investors are likely tempted to view its stock as an attractive long-term play. After all, Boeing and \n        Airbus\n       are the world\u2019s two major aerospace companies.  Anyone who owns Boeing stock\u2014and many investors had recently bought it because the company seemed to be healing\u2014face tough decisions. They can sell the stock and use the loss to offset portfolio gains, or they can sell bullish call options on their shares to generate income. (Calls give holders the right to purchase an asset at a set price within a set period.) Call sellers should stick to one-month expirations and strike prices that are about 5% to 10% above Boeing\u2019s stock price. Boeing\u2019s troubles make the stock so opaque that it is impossible to know what happens next. The simple strategy pays investors to wait for Boeing to heal.  Those who don\u2019t own the stock and can\u2019t resist a potential bargain should consider using options to define risks. Options also cost less money than buying stock.  Because Boeing\u2019s situation is so abnormal, it is difficult to have confidence about anything the company does or says. That makes Boeing\u2019s first-quarter earnings report, expected in late April, a possible high-volatility event.  It should be approached with caution. The company is led by a lame-duck CEO who has lost the confidence of many of his peers in the aviation industry. Will Boeing use the financial report as an opportunity to unload more bad news, or to persuade investors that the company is healthier than perceived?   One way to pre-position is to consider bull and bear spreads. The strategies entail buying a bullish call or bearish put option and selling another with a different strike price to create a trading range that increases in value if the stock rises or falls. With Boeing stock at $187.50, bullish investors could buy the May $195 call and sell the May $205 call. If the stock is at $205 at expiration, the spread\u2019s maximum profit is $10. Investors who think the stock has further to fall can buy the May $185 put and sell the May $175 put. If the stock is at $175 at expiration, the spread\u2019s max profit is $10. (Puts give holders the right to sell an asset at a set price within a set period.) During the past 52 weeks, Boeing\u2019s stock has traded from $176.25 to $267.54. This year, the stock is down 28%, sharply underperforming the \n        S&P 500 index,\n       which is up 9.1%. Boeing is a show-me, don\u2019t-tell-me stock. Management needs to demonstrate with actions\u2014and not with words carefully chosen for investors\u2014that it has fixed what is broken.  Until then, the stock faces a tough road. A technical review of Boeing stock shows that it is below critical support levels, which likely portends a struggle to trade higher. This makes the stock dependent on happenstance and news flow\u2014which are harder to forecast than stock trading patterns and options volatility.

            "text": "If you want to get a fascinating insight into the crisis that has enveloped Boeing Co. \n        BA,\n        +0.24%,\n       look no further than the company\u2019s filings relating to executive compensation \u2014 or, some might say, executive plunder. There you will find that the board of directors kept lavishing tens of millions in pay, bonuses and extra awards on Chief Executive David Calhoun, even as the company\u2019s stockholder lost billions and the once-iconic company\u2019s reputation went down the tubes.  You will find that Calhoun, a finance guy parachuted into the hot seat from private-equity firm Blackstone just over four years ago, was paid about 150 times more per year than the typical worker \u2014 i.e. the people building the planes. You\u2019ll find that his pay averaged $22 million a year during his first three years \u2014 and that he is in line for a $14.9 million payout for \u201cretiring\u201d early. Astonishingly, Boeing filings show that as recently as a year ago, the board even gave him an extra $619,000 bonus, specifically citing the great job he was supposedly doing on things like\u00a0quality, safety and transparency with regulators.  Also read: Opinion:\u00a0Boeing\u2019s CEO is departing, but the company\u2019s problems run far deeper In case you missed it, Calhoun and other executives on Monday agreed to step down early amid a mounting scandal over, er, quality, safety, and\u2026 transparency with regulators. For Boeing and Calhoun, the final straw came last week, when major airline executives, fed up with all the issues with Boeing planes and its production schedule, demanded direct meetings with the board of directors.\u00a0 Probably the most devastating judgment comes from Michael O\u2019Leary, the blunt-taking Irishman who has built European low-cost airline Ryanair \n        RYAAY,\n        +0.01%.\n       His confidence in Boeing planes is now so low, he told CNN recently, that when the airline takes delivery of a new one \u201cwe spend 48 hours going through the plane checking it for errors, omissions or anything else.\u201d  (Meanwhile aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia gets credit for the money quote. He told CNN that Calhoun is \u201cthe very best CEO that\u00a0Airbus\u00a0has ever had,\u201d referring to Boeing\u2019s now-booming rival). Boeing has been in crisis since two crashes involving its new 737 Max airliners in 2018 and 2019, which killed 346 people. CEO Dennis Muilenberg was ousted in late 2019, to be replaced by Calhoun.\u00a0 Things got worse at the start of this year, when a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max soon after takeoff. An investigation found that Boeing had apparently forgotten to install four bolts. The FAA has slammed Boeing over quality-control issues, while the National Transportation Safety Board has criticized the company for failing to produce key safety documents.  Clearly the problems started a long time before Calhoun became CEO. Some critics argue they go back a quarter century, to the late 1990s, when Boeing merged with rival McDonnell Douglas. Nonetheless, Boeing stockholders have lost just over 40% of their money on Calhoun\u2019s watch. During the same period, shares of Europe-based Airbus \n        AIR,\n        -0.92%\n       are up 33%, even despite the weak euro. The S&P 500 \n        SPX\n       has risen more than 70% in that time.\u00a0 The good news for Boeing stockholders is that all sorts of rich and powerful people in America \u2014 and especially Uncle Sam \u2014 have enormous economic incentives in keeping Boeing in the air. It is a major defense contractor. But it\u2019s also one of just two major airplane manufacturers left. Nobody wants Airbus to have a total monopoly. We will have to wait for further news from the company about how much Calhoun will walk away with. The overall picture, as usual, is obscured by the elaborate, byzantine legal disclosures. But page 80 of the last proxy shows that as of February 2023, he had already accumulated 225,000 shares and stock units, with a gross value of about $43 million. Nice work if you can get it!

            "text": "Sometimes what seems to be bad news is good news. \nBoeing\n       stock headed lower Tuesday morning after BofA Securities pointed out the company delivered only three 737 MAX jets in a week. That pace is well below what Wall Street expects, but going slow makes sense for the company right now.   Boeing stock was off 1.5% in midday trading at $188.59 a share, while the \n        S&P 500\n       and \n        Nasdaq Composite\n       were both up about 0.3%.  One of the factors influencing shares on Tuesday is 737 MAX deliveries. BofA Securities analyst Ron Epstein, who tracks deliveries of the planes, said he had counted just 16 MAX deliveries in March through the 21st. Only three of those were delivered in the week leading up to that date. Boeing said in response to a request for comment that it would post March delivery results to its website on April 9. It didn\u2019t address Epstein\u2019s numbers.   The running March total isn\u2019t a lot of jets. Boeing delivered 42 MAX jets in January and February. With the March volume added in, the company has sent some 60 MAX jets to customers so far this year.  Boeing can produce about 38 MAX jets a month. It also has dozens of jets it built and parked during the worldwide grounding that spanned March 2019 to November 2022. Those jets eventually will get delivered to Boeing customers too.  The inventory of parked planes plus Boeing\u2019s level of production have Wall Street projecting 2024 MAX deliveries of 470 units, or almost 40 a month. The first-quarter performance makes that full-year number look unlikely and could mean analysts will have to cut their financial forecasts for Boeing.  The silver lining to the lower production is that it means Boeing is going slower. CFO Brian West recently told investors that Boeing isn\u2019t accepting nonconforming parts from \n        Spirit AeroSystems\n       any longer. Boeing, in other words, is prioritizing initial quality over its production schedule.  \u201cWhat I want is a production system that\u2019s under control every step of the way,\u201d said CEO Dave Calhoun in a CNBC interview on Monday. \u201cWhether it\u2019s 38, or 52 or 16 [MAX jets] it doesn\u2019t matter. It will be under control. We will not travel work to anywhere near the level that it\u2019s been traveled and we will let this supply chain catch up to the demand\u2026that\u2019s the way we have to behave.\u201d  Traveled work refers to doing a job somewhere on the assembly line other than the place where it was supposed to be finished. Eliminating traveled work is another example of prioritizing initial quality over scheduling.  Managing nonconformance from suppliers and reducing traveled work are sensible steps Boeing can take to address its recent manufacturing and quality problems. Lower deliveries are a sign the company is doing just that.  Investors might not like lower production, but they hate crises even more. Boeing stock was at about $440 a share before the second of two MAX crashes grounded the jet for more than a year in March 2019. The shares were at $249 before an emergency door plug blew out of a 737 MAX 9 jet operated by \n        Alaska Air\n       on Jan. 5.  The shares are below $190 now. At this point, investors should be willing to accept some short-term pain for long-term gain.

            "text": "The numbers: Orders for U.S. durable goods rebounded in February with a 1.4% gain and business investment also rose in perhaps an early sign of revival in the manufacturing side of the economy. Economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal had forecast a 1% increase. Orders plunged in January because of a seasonal decline in Boeing airplane contracts.   Excluding transportation, orders for manufactured goods advanced a solid 0.5%, the government said. So-called core also increased 0.7%, rising for the first time in three months. The figure omits defense and transportation and is seen as a proxy for broader business investment. Taken together, these figures suggest U.S. manufacturers might be perking up after a few years of malaise. Key details: Bookings rose in February for commercial planes and new cars and trucks to pad the headline increase in orders. Orders also rose for metals and metal parts that are used in the early stages of production for many industrial goods. Yet shipments of manufactured goods already produced fell in February and could weigh a bit on gross domestic product in the first quarter. These figures are used to help determine GDP, the official scorecard of the economy.  Core shipments rose 0.8% in January, however. Big picture: The manufacturing side of the economy appears to be thawing out after a few years of sluggish demand, but a full recovery is unlikely until the Federal Reserve starts to cut interest rates. Lower rates would boost demand for durable goods \u2014 items meant to last at least three years \u2014and encourage more business investment.\u00a0 Looking ahead: \u201cRestrictive monetary policy continues to weigh on tangible investment,\u201d said economist Ali Jaffery of CIBC Economics.

            "text": "The departure of Boeing CEO David Calhoun came sooner than expected. With any luck, it will be the last surprise for a while. The exit was unusual for coming before the board had a successor lined up. But given the airplane maker\u2019s ever-growing problems, the board also couldn\u2019t afford to wait. Calhoun\u2019s main task in his final months on the job\u2013he\u2019s stepping down at the end of the year\u2013should be to ensure that as much bad news about the company as possible walks out the door with him. Along the way, he\u2019ll have to weather numerous investigations by regulators, and possibly the acquisition of fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems, the unit that Boeing demerged in 2005.  That\u2019s a lot, but the task of the incoming CEO is even more daunting. A fundamental concern has been over Boeing\u2019s production processes. It has said it will fix any mistakes it has made. The company was contacted for comment early Tuesday. It\u2019s not a new problem\u2013Calhoun himself was brought in to clean up the mess from two fatal MAX 737 crashes in 2018 and 2019. Boeing has spent considerably less than rival \n        Airbus\n       on research and development since 2010, and has favored revamping old models rather than all new designs. Some argue that Boeing\u2019s problems go all the way back to the merger with McDonnell Douglas in 1997. Fixing a problem with the company\u2019s culture, if that\u2019s what it is, won\u2019t be enough. The CEO also has a second job - Boeing has to show people that it\u2019s getting better, which will be an enormous job in itself. Boeing shareholders have to hope that things can only go up. But they\u2019re not so sure\u2013the stock rose just 1.4% on Monday following the news of the changes. If Boeing fails to recover fast enough, it could lose more ground to Airbus and open the door to a challenge from a Chinese aircraft builder. The stakes for the new CEO couldn\u2019t be higher.  \u2014Brian Swint Boeing has turned to a battle-tested board member as it fights to recover from a series of troubling problems with its aircraft. Steve Mollenkopf, \n        Qualcomm\u2019s\n       former CEO, has been tapped as \n        Boeing\u2019s\n       new chairman, taking the spot four years after he joined the board as current Chair Larry Kellner departs. What\u2019s Next: Three names come up most often when discussing Calhoun\u2019s possible successors: Larry Culp, the CEO of \n        General Electric,\n       a key Boeing supplier; Bill Brown, the former CEO of defense giant \n        L3Harris Technologies\n       who is set to become CEO of \n        3M\n       in May; and Patrick Shanahan, CEO of Spirit AeroSystems. \u2014Liz Moyer and Al Root Former President Donald Trump\u2019s media company, the owner of his Truth Social platform, starts trading on the Nasdaq today after completing its merger with a blank check company. The occasion would boost Trump\u2019s fortunes, at least on paper, by nearly $4 billion based on Monday\u2019s closing price for the shell company. What\u2019s Next: Trump has several days to post the bond, halting New York Attorney General\u2019s plans to collect by potentially seizing property. Trump could have to pay the $454 million if he loses his appeal. Another $10 million in combined judgments were issued for two of Trump\u2019s sons and a former associate. \u2014Paul R. La Monica and Janet H. Cho Electric vehicle start-up \n        Fisker\n       is back to the drawing board after its talks about a potential deal with a large auto maker fell through, renewing questions about its finances and the possibility of it seeking bankruptcy protection. Fisker said alternative moves may include in or out-of-court restructurings. What\u2019s Next: The New York Stock Exchange has begun the delisting process for Fisker\u2019s stock because it has dropped so low, down to 9 cents a share before being halted on Monday. Trading in the stock was suspended immediately. The EV maker has a right to review the exchange\u2019s decision and appeal. \u2014Janet H. Cho Fast food workers in California will soon see their minimum hourly pay rise to $20, but that means franchisees will be cutting labor costs by laying off workers, freezing hiring, and shifting tasks to automation. Some chains are reducing hours, serving faster-to-prepare menu items, and expanding self-service options. What\u2019s Next: Some chains see an opportunity to pick up market share since the rising wages hit all their competitors, too. They plan more support for franchisees, including advertising spending, product innovations, and technology updates. \n        McDonald\u2019s\n       CEO Chris Kempczinski said the company is better positioned versus competitors. \u2014Janet H.

            "text": "It might not seem fair, but markets keep score with stock prices, and by that measure, the tenure of \n        Boeing\n       CEO Dave Calhoun has been a disappointment. But that it isn\u2019t reflected in his paycheck.  Calhoun announced on Monday he would step down at the end of the year, without the board naming a successor.  Running Boeing has been a difficult task. Calhoun took over during the worldwide grounding of the MAX after two deadly crashes within five months of one another.  The\u00a0Federal Aviation Administration later capped\u00a0737 MAX production at 38 jets a month after an emergency door plug blew out midflight on Jan. 5.\u00a0The agency is requiring production quality improvements before it allows Boeing to ramp up the production rate.  Still, transitions are a good chance for investors to consider if they are getting what they paid for\u2014and the math for Calhoun looks tough.  Boeing shares were roughly $330 a piece when Calhoun officially started on Jan. 13, 2020. Now they are closer to $191, down more than 40%. \n        Airbus\n       stock is up about 26% during Calhoun\u2019s tenure.  And with months left as CEO, Calhoun has been paid some $65 million for leading Boeing. The $65 million figure is through 2022. Executive compensation is typically disclosed in annual proxy statements, and Boeing\u2019s 2024 proxy isn\u2019t available yet.   Calhoun\u2019s annual salary is about $1.4 million and his target annual bonus is about $17 million.  Boeing declined to comment on CEO compensation.  Executive pay is set by a board compensation committee that benchmarks peers and comes up with performance targets. Boeing\u2019s peer group, reported in prior proxy statements, includes firms such as \n        3M,\nFord Motor,\nProcter & Gamble,\nRTX,\nCaterpillar,\n       and \n        Microsoft.\n       CEO compensation for those companies averaged almost $25 million in 2023, according to Bloomberg. That $25 million was earned for relatively average performance.  Looking over the past five years, an investment in the S&P 500 has doubled investor money, adding about 15% a year. The six peers have almost doubled investor money, gaining a little more than 13% a year. Boeing stock has lost investors roughly 50%, or about 12% a year on average.  To be sure, judging CEO success only by stock market returns alone is limited. Returns, however, weigh heavily on Wall Street\u2019s collective mind. Two of the top three candidates analysts suggested when Barron\u2019s asked who could be good Boeing chief executives were \n        General Electric\n       CEO Larry Culp and former \n        L3Harris Technologies\n       CEO Bill Brown.  Both are able CEOs with aerospace experience. They also have a track record of making investors money.  GE stock is up almost 140% since Larry Culp took over in October 2018, for an average annual gain of about 18%. L3Harris stock grew more than eightfold during Brown\u2019s tenure between 2011 and 2022, earning investors north of 20% a year.  It is unlikely those would be the top two names suggested if their stocks didn\u2019t perform like that.

            "text": "United Airlines is under increasing scrutiny from regulators after a number of safety issues in recent weeks.  It could be a warning for the broader industry. United may even have bigger problems than \n        Boeing,\n       which announced Monday that CEO Dave Calhoun will step down at the end of the year. United stock tumbled in early trading Monday and the airline sector in general was also under pressure. Delays to Boeing aircraft deliveries will force U.S. carriers to keep flying older planes, which typically require more maintenance. Repair and maintenance costs have been rising for airlines in recent years amid supply-chain problems. When it comes to maintenance United has been forking out. It spent $2.74 billion on maintenance materials and repairs in 2023, a 27% increase on the previous year. It warned in its annual 10-K report last month that more delivery delays could lead to further increases in maintenance costs or cuts to its schedule\u2014impacting revenue. United has been fairly vocal in its frustrations with Boeing this year but the Federal Aviation Administration is now taking a greater interest in the carrier itself, following a series of mishaps.  Ultimately, carriers are responsible for the maintenance of their aircraft. The FAA is increasing its oversight of \n        United\n       and could delay some future projects based on its findings. United faces potential restrictions on new routes and the use of new planes, The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.\u00a0 The sheer number of incidents has concerned regulators. An aging United Airlines Boeing 737-800 aircraft was found to have a missing external panel earlier this month, while a United Boeing 777 lost a wheel taking off from San Francisco on March 7. A number of other United flights have encountered issues too, including a Boeing 757 which had a damaged wing and was forced to make an emergency landing in Denver last month. The potential consequences of the FAA\u2019s renewed oversight are clearly leaving investors worried too. The stock fell 3.4% on Monday. \n        Delta Air Lines\n       dropped by 0.4%, \n        American Airlines\n       rose by 0.7%, and \n        Southwest Airlines\n       gained 0.2%. It goes without saying that not being able to fly new routes or new planes would impact United\u2019s financial performance. Wall Street is already unconvinced by United\u2019s full-year guidance for earnings of between $9 and $11 per share in 2024\u2013analysts currently see $9.65 per share. It could also have implications for United\u2019s long-term aggressive growth plans. The carrier has a target to grow domestic capacity by almost 30% by 2026 under its United Next strategy launched in 2021. United removed the Boeing MAX-10, which is yet to be certified, from its internal plans earlier this year and said it will not grow as quickly without it. Restrictions by the regulator risk slowing growth even more. \u201cOver the next several weeks, we will begin to see more of an FAA presence in our operation as they begin to review some of our work processes, manuals and facilities,\u201d United\u2019s vice president of corporate safety said in a memo to employees Friday passed to Barron\u2019s by the airline Monday. \u201cAs part of this effort, the FAA will also pause a variety of certification activities for a period of time,\u201d she added. United\u2019s problems and the FAA\u2019s increased oversight are a reminder, if one were needed, of the maintenance problem that could potentially engulf the sector.

            "text": "Shares of Boeing Co. rose Monday, as the aerospace and defense giant\u2019s chief executive, Dave Calhoun, said he will step down at the end of the year. The embattled company also announced several other management changes. The CEO of its commercial-airplanes business will retire, and the chairman of the board will step down. \u201cThe eyes of the world are on us, and I know that we will come through this moment a better company,\u201d said Calhoun, who became Boeing CEO in January 2020. The stock \n        BA,\n        +0.32%\n       rose 1.2% in active afternoon trading, but pared earlier gains of as much as 3.9%. Trading volume was around 9.8 million shares, already more than the full-day average of about 7.7 million shares. Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said it\u2019s rare that someone losing their job is cause for celebration, but he believes Calhoun\u2019s departure is a \u201cwise\u201d move by the company. Calhoun has faced mounting pressure recently given the recent quality-control issues on commercial jets made by Boeing, including the blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines plane in January. The quality problems have led to production pauses. Deliveries have fallen behind last year\u2019s pace and the company\u2019s stock has fallen. Calhoun said in an interview on CNBC that his departure to was \u201c100%\u201d his decision: \u201cIt\u2019s me giving them notice that at the end of this year I plan to retire.\u201d He noted that at the end of 2024, he\u2019ll be close to 68 years old. Regarding complaints that Boeing\u2019s focus was more on sales than safety, Calhoun said on CNBC that the plan is to \u201cslow things down.\u201d Vertical Research\u2019s Stallard wrote in a note to clients: \u201cMany of Boeing\u2019s customers, suppliers and other stakeholders have arguably lost faith in the company, while its relations with the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] and NTSB [National Transportation Safety Board] are clearly strained.\u201d He said the fact that the company has not yet identified a replacement for Calhoun leaves a \u201cmajor piece that is missing from the puzzle,\u201d that shouldn\u2019t worry investors as much as Calhoun\u2019s departure pleases them. And Benchmark\u2019s Josh Sullivan said he believes the management changes were necessary to appease regulators, customers and investors, and are a \u201cpositive for resetting the table.\u201d He reiterated his buy rating on the stock and his $250 price target, which implies about 30% upside from current levels.  Boeing\u2019s stock has tumbled 26.7% year to date, to make it the worst-performing Dow Jones Industrial Average \n        DJIA\n       component this year, and the S&P 500 index\u2019s \n        SPX\n       second-worst performer. In comparison, the U.S.-listed shares of France-based rival Airbus SE \n        EADSY,\n        +1.03%\nAIR,\n        -0.92%\n       have run up 19.3% this year, and were on track to close at a record high. Separately, Larry Kellner, who has been chairman of the board since 2019, said he does not plan to stand for re-election at the upcoming shareholder meeting. The board elected Steve Mollenkopf to succeed Kellner. Mollenkopf has been a Boeing director since 2020, and was a former CEO of Qualcomm Inc. \n        QCOM,\n        +1.72%\n Mollenkopf will lead the board\u2019s process of selecting Boeing\u2019s next CEO. Stan Deal, CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, will retire after being in the position since October 2019. He will be succeeded by Chief Operating Officer Stephanie Pope, who had been chief financial officer of Boeing Commercial Airplanes from December 2020 to March 2022. \u201cBoeing is in deep need of a change in culture around safety and quality,\u201d said Timothy Hubbard, assistant professor of management at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business. \u201cThese changes take time, but can be accelerated by new leadership.\u201d The NBA and other major sports leagues make millions from legalized gambling.

            "text": "In \n        Boeing\u2019s\n       quest to recover from a series of troubling technical problems with its aircraft, the company has turned to a battle-tested member of its own board with deep roots in the technology business.  Boeing said Monday that Steve Mollenkopf, who spent seven years as CEO of \n        Qualcomm,\n       would be its new chairman. Mollenkopf has been on the Boeing board since February 2020.  Boeing CEO David Calhoun is also stepping down, although no replacement has yet been named, inevitably intensifying the spotlight on Mollenkopf. Boeing has tasked Mollenkopf with leading the search for the company\u2019s next CEO.  Shares of Boeing were up 1.6% in mid-day trading Monday. In a post on LinkedIn on Monday, Qualcomm VP of Communications Clare Conley wrote that Mollenkopf led the chip company through \u201can unprecedented and difficult time\u201d adding that \u201cin a time of much turbulence and when the stakes were high, he was the calm and steady leader that the company needed.\u201d In January 2021, Mollenkopf made the surprise decision to retire as CEO of Qualcomm, the company he had had joined 26 years earlier out of graduate school. Mollenkopf has an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from Virginia Tech, and a Master of Science degree in the same field from the University of Michigan. He has 38 patents in his name.  Mollenkopf took over the top job at Qualcomm in 2014, stepping down at the relatively young age of 52 and handing over the reins to Cristiano Amon, another Qualcomm lifer. At the time of the announcement, Mollenkopf told reporters that he had no immediate post-retirement plans, other than to pursue personal passions like hiking, fishing, and swimming. His only real corporate role at that point was a seat on the Boeing board, a position he took in February 2020. Since stepping down at Qualcomm, Mollenkopf has also served as a \u201cspecial advisor\u201d to Consello Group, a corporate advisory firm founded by Declan Kelly, who is well known for providing advice to CEOs and other corporate leaders.  Last year, Mollenkopf also accepted a seat on the board at \n        Dell Technologies.\n       He has remained a strategy advisor to Qualcomm. Mollenkopf\u2019s tenure as Qualcomm\u2019s chief was a tumultuous one. In 2018, the company\u2019s bid to acquire chipmaker NXP Semiconductor collapsed in the face of opposition from Chinese regulators. That same year, \n        Broadcom\n       abandoned a hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm in the face of opposition from then-President Donald Trump, who took the position that the proposed deal was risky from a national security perspective. Qualcomm also spent years in a series of complex patent disputes with \n        Apple.\n       In 2020, a federal appeals court reversed a lower court ruling that its mobile chip and patent licensing business had violated antitrust laws. Qualcomm stock returned an annualized 13% during Mollenkopf\u2019s time as CEO versus a 14.4% return for the S&P 500. When Mollenkopf stepped down from his role at Qualcomm he noted that he had joined the company at age 24 as an engineer right out of grad school. Mollenkopf said he had been thinking about the move for some time and knew that \u201cno matter when I retire it will seem early to people.\u201d  He said he wanted to leave when he knew the company was in a strong position. \u201cThe mistake would have been to stay too long,\u201d he says.

The Federal Aviation Administration capped 737 MAX production at 38 per month after the Jan. 5 in-flight emergency door plug blowout. The production slowdown, and related quality issues, will lead to another year of losses in Boeing\u2019s commercial airplane business, Boeing CFO Brian West warned on Wednesday.  \u201cRegime change now is essential,\u201d AeroDynamic Advisory managing director Richard Aboulafia tells Barron\u2019s.  \u201cCustomers and the FAA need [their] pound of flesh,\u201d says Benchmark analyst Josh Sullivan, adding he wasn\u2019t expecting to see anything announced as soon as it happened.  Boeing didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment about succession.  Sullivan\u2019s caveat reflects how Wall Street talks about management succession. Few like to call for someone\u2019s job explicitly. There are reasons for that. For starters, continuing business relationships are at stake.   There is also no easy answer about who is to blame for Boeing\u2019s current woes. Most analysts reference the late 1990s Boeing-McDonnell-Douglas merger when explaining how the company ended up in its current mess. Most analysts also credit Calhoun for returning the 737 MAX to service in November 2020 after its worldwide grounding for almost two years after two deadly crashes within five months.  Calhoun draws his share of criticism too. Boeing continues to bleed single-aisle jet market share to \n        Airbus\n       and has no brand-new model that could stem those losses on the horizon. The larger MAX 10, which better competes with larger A321 model jets, isn\u2019t certified for commercial service. Certification looks years away, frustrating Boeing customers. And there is the door plug mess.  It\u2019s all problematic. Most damning might be the stock\u2019s performance. Boeing shares were about $330 apiece when Calhoun was named CEO at the end of 2019. The stock is off some 40% since then while the \n        S&P 500\n       is up roughly 60%. While the pandemic makes comparisons involving aviation difficult\u2014Covid-19 hammered demand for air travel\u2014Airbus shares are up about 25% over the same span. Investors aren\u2019t a very forgiving group, making change a possibility. Three names come up most often when discussing Calhoun\u2019s successors: Larry Culp, Bill Brown, and Patrick Shanahan.   Culp runs \n        General Electric,\n       a dominant supplier of jet engines, and a key Boeing supplier. Culp parachuted into another crisis in 2018 when he took over GE. Wall Street, at the time, questioned the choice, wondering if his prior success at \n        Danaher\n       would translate into a different industry. It did\u2014as evidenced by the number of times analysts say \u201cCulp\u201d when asked who could help Boeing.   Culp, however, is busy breaking up GE into GE Aerospace and GE Vernova\u2014the company\u2019s power generation businesses. He will remain CEO of GE Aerospace. Brown, the former CEO of defense giant \n        L3Harris Technologies,\n       is tied up too. He was just named CEO of \n        3M,\n       replacing current CEO Mike Roman in May.  Of those three, that leaves Shanahan, the current CEO of Boeing supplier \n        Spirit AeroSystems.\n       Spirit also has its quality issues, but Shanahan took over in September. What\u2019s more, Spirit Aero might end up part of Boeing again. The two companies have acknowledged merger talks. Spirit Aero was part of Boeing until it was sold to the Canadian private-equity firm Onex in 2005.  \u201cShanahan would be a brilliant choice, and Culp excellent too,\u201d says Aboulafia.   Shanahan has a master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering and an M.B.A. from MIT. Impressive.  Still, he isn\u2019t a universal choice. Shanahan is a Boeing insider, working some three decades at the company before leaving. \u201cWhat they really need is a true outsider with a pedigree that is not afraid to sort this mess out, even though it will take years,\u201d says Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard. \u201cBill Brown would have been ideal\u2026but he went to 3M.\u201d  Predicting leadership changes is never easy. Other names analysts tossed into the mix include several non-Boeing aerospace and defense executives between the ages of 50 and 70.  Benchmark\u2019s Sullivan suggested former Boeing executive and \n        Ford Motor\n       CEO Alan Mulally who is in his late 70s. \u201cLater years\u2026but so are both of our presidential candidates,\u201d he said.  Change has come. Along with Calhoun\u2019s resignation, Boeing Commerical Airplane Chief Stan Deal is being replaced by Chief Operating Officer Stephanie Pope. Board Chair Larry Kellner announced his decision not to stand for re-election. Steve Mollenkopf will be the new chair.  Calhoun has done the job for four-plus years and is turning 67 in April. He still has some things to work through before he\u2019s finished. \u201cUsually [before] management changes you let all the pain be taken,\u201d adds Sullivan.  Finishing a Spirit Aero takeover or seeing the FAA loosen the Boeing 737 production cap are two things Calhoun would like to make progress on. Boeing also faces labor negotiations with its largest union\u2014The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. A contract impacting some 30,000 workers in Seattle expires in September.  Since the 737 MAX 9 door incident, shares are off about 25%, underperforming the S&P 500 by some 36 percentage points.  Whoever follows Calhoun faces the difficult task of turning Boeing around.

            "text": "\nBoeing\n       CFO Brian West dashed Wall Street\u2019s free cash flow expectations for 2024 earlier this week, but shares rose anyway. Boeing ended the week up 3.5% at $188.85 a share. But there is good reason for investors to be skeptical about the positive reaction\u2014Boeing\u2019s free cash flow goals just aren\u2019t realistic.  In November 2022, Boeing laid out plans to hit $10 billion in annual free cash flow by 2025 or 2026. West reassured on Wednesday that $10 billion would happen\u2014but patience was required.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to take us longer to get there,\u201d he said, adding the goals are \u201cstill intact.\u201d   Intact is good. It just forgets to account for something Boeing needs to do sooner than later\u2014invest in a new medium-size aircraft.  The debate about Boeing\u2019s next single-aisle jet has raged since, at least, 2015 when Boeing was considering how to replace the 757 jet. Dennis Muilenburg was CEO at the time. Current CEO Dave Calhoun, who officially took over for Muilenburg in early 2020, effectively killed off the idea in November 2022.  \u201cI don\u2019t want to fill a gap in a product line,\u201d Calhoun said at his company\u2019s investor event.  Ideally, new planes that replace old planes lower costs for airline operators by roughly 20% to 30%. Calhoun wants to wait until engine, manufacturing, and materials technologies imply that level of gain before spending the money. He also, of course, had to divert billions to fixing the 737 MAX program.   \u201cIdeally\u201d sounds great, but it is getting harder to deny Boeing has a significant hole in its product line. One that needs plugging.  AeroDynamic Advisory Managing Director Richard Aboulafia points out the \n        Airbus\n       A321neo has taken a lion\u2019s share of the market for single-aisle planes that carry more than 200 passengers. The A321neo\u2019s lead on the MAX has grown since Calhoun made his comments.  Boeing just never replaced the 757. The MAX was supposed to be enough. The 757, introduced to service in 1983, could carry some 290 passengers in certain configurations. The 737 MAX 10\u2014the longest version of the MAX which isn\u2019t certified for commercial service yet\u2014lists a 230-seat maximum. The A321neo can fit up to 244 people.  The difference between 230 and 244 doesn\u2019t seem large and the A321neo is only a couple of feet longer than the 737 MAX 10. Still, the differences matter to airlines. Just look at the orders.  Boeing and Airbus have been locked in a battle for decades, constantly leapfrogging each other. Over the past 40 years, in the single-aisle segment of the market, Boeing has introduced the 737 Classic, 737 Next Generation, 737 MAX, and 757 jets. Airbus has introduced the A320 and A320neo, the A321 and A321neo, and the A318 jets.  Each plane has different versions and variants, but a significantly new jet for each manufacturer has entered service every 10 years or so. Forgetting any debate about the MAX versus the A321neo, or the pluses and minuses of a new medium-size aircraft, that timeline implies Boeing needs to do something in a few years. The MAX was introduced to service in 2017.  That means higher spending which puts free cash flow goals at risk.  After West\u2019s talk, BofA Securities analyst Ron Epstein lowered his near-term free cash flow estimates. He expects Boeing to generate $686 million in free cash flow this year, $4.8 billion in 2025, and $6.1 billion in 2026. His previous estimates were $4.2 billion, $6.3 billion, and $8 billion, respectively.  Epstein adds the later year estimates don\u2019t include new plane development, something he\u2019s argued Boeing should do.  How much extra cash will be needed is a question for investors to ponder. In the years leading up to the launch of the 787, which was introduced to service in 2011, Boeing was spending roughly 10% of sales each year on capital equipment and R&D. Spending in recent years has averaged closer to 6% of sales.  A new plane added into the mix might cost Boeing an extra $2 billion a year later in the decade. That would morph the $10 billion free cash flow goal into an $8 billion free cash flow goal.  The good news for Boeing investors is that at an Airbus valuation multiple, $8 billion in 2027 free cash flow works out to a Boeing stock price of about $200 to $210 a share.  Given where Boeing stock is trading, it might be a good time for the company to do something dramatic, but investors shouldn\u2019t hold their breath. Boeing referred Barron\u2019s to West\u2019s comments Wednesday when asked about spending.  \u201cWe spent $5 billion between R&D and CapEx in 2023. That\u2019s 20% plus higher than it was the previous year,\u201d said the CFO adding, \u201cThere needs to be advanced engine technology and aerodynamic investment in order to get an airplane that\u2019s 20% to 30% more efficient than we are today and that will not be rushed.\u201d  It sounds like Calhoun\u2019s 2022 comments.  \u201cCurrent leadership will never do a new jet, so cash flow doesn\u2019t need to factor it,\u201d reflects Aboulafia. \u201cThey\u2019ll simply move to a much lower market share.\u201d  Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com Alphabet shares surge after Google\u2019s parent posts better-than-expected earnings and announces its first cash dividend, Microsoft posts 31% quarterly growth in Azure cloud-computing revenue, and Exxon Mobil\u2019s earnings miss estimates.

            "text": "United Airlines Holdings Inc. on Friday said that the Federal Aviation Administration would begin to review some of the airline\u2019s operations, following a string of safety mishaps with the carrier.  United \n        UAL,\n        -1.44%\n       made the announcement after several incidents at the airline in recent days \u2014 including a tire that fell off a jet, an engine fire on another, and a missing panel on another \u2014 and as jet-maker Boeing Co. \n        BA,\n        +0.36%\n       faces deeper scrutiny over its production standards and culture.   Sasha Johnson, United\u2019s vice president of corporate safety, said in a memo that \u201cthe number of safety-related events in recent weeks have rightfully caused us to pause and evaluate whether there is anything we can and should do differently.\u201d She said the carrier had increased its interactions with the FAA recently, and the agency needed to look further into multiple aspects of its operations.  The memo added: \u201cOver the next several weeks, we will begin to see more of an FAA presence in our operation as they begin to review some of our work processes, manuals and facilities. We welcome their engagement and are very open to hear from them about what they find and their perspective on things we may need to change to make us even safer.\u201d It also said the FAA would pause \u201ca variety of certification activities for a period of time.\u201d The news was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal. United declined to comment beyond the details offered in the memo.  According to a New York Times tally on Monday, United has dealt with eight flight-related safety incidents over the past two weeks. No one was reported as injured in those incidents. But those incidents have occurred in the wake of a door-plug blowout on a Boeing 737 Max jet flown by Alaska Airlines in January, which has led to heightened attention to flight safety.   \u201cThe FAA\u2019s safety assurance system routinely monitors all aspects of an airline\u2019s operation,\u201d the FAA said in an emailed statement. \u201cIt\u00a0focuses on an airline\u2019s compliance with applicable regulations; ability to identify hazards, assess and mitigate risk; and effectively manage safety.\u201d Shares of United were down 0.7% after hours.  Earlier this week, United Airlines Chief Executive Scott Kirby sought to assuage travelers.  \u201cUnfortunately, in the past few weeks, our airline has experienced a number of incidents that are reminders of the importance of safety,\u201d he said in a memo, according to the Associated Press. \u201cWhile they are all unrelated, I want you to know that these incidents have our attention and have sharpened our focus.\u201d     Southwest Airlines Co.\u2019s stock tumbled 9% Thursday after the airline posted a wider-than-expected first-quarter loss and revenue that lagged estimates.

            "text": "\nGeneral Electric\n       stock is on a once-in-a-generation winning streak. Next week will be big.  Through midday trading Friday, GE stock is up about 4% for the week, putting it on pace to rise for 11 consecutive weeks. That\u2019s the longest weekly winning streak for the stock since November 1996, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That is more than 27 years ago, when Bill Clinton was president.  That\u2019s quite something. Shares have been buoyed by several factors, including an earnings beat reported in January, solid free cash flow guidance, and the coming April 2 breakup that will create GE Aerospace and GE Vernova\u2014GE\u2019s power-generation-related businesses.  More recently, the strength of the aerospace aftermarket has helped boost shares. \n        Boeing,\n       in particular, is struggling to raise plane production, which keeps older planes in service longer. That is a positive for firms that sell parts and service older aircraft, such as GE.  Results from \n        AAR,\n       an aftermarket parts and service supplier, also bode well for GE\u2019s aerospace business. AAR reported its fiscal third-quarter earnings Thursday evening.  \u201cWithin\u00a0AAR\u2019s Parts Supply segment\u2026commercial sales for its new parts distribution business rose 27%, which should serve as a positive read-through for other commercial aftermarket stocks,\u201d wrote Melius analyst Robert Spingarn in a Friday report. He called out GE, \n        RTX,\nSafran,\nHeico,\nTransDigm,\n       and \n        Woodward\n       as winners.  He likes AAR, rating shares Buy. His price target for the stock is $86.  Curiously, AAR stock is down about 7% after earnings, but investors can\u2019t blame Wall Street for the drop. Spingarn was fine with the quarter, as was William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma, who also rates it at Buy, but without a price target. DiPalma points out there is the potential for \u201ddouble-digit\u201d operating profit margins in fiscal year 2025. Wall Street projects 2024 profit margins of about 8% and 2024 margins of just under 10%.  All five analysts covering AAR stock rate shares Buy. The average analyst price target is $82.  Looking ahead, investors will see GE Vernova stock trading on a \u201cwhen issued\u201d this coming week. Trading begins on or about March 27 under the stock symbol \u201cGEV.\u201d Spinoff shares will sometimes trade before the actual shares show up in investors\u2019 brokerage accounts. That way, investors get a sense of how a new company will be valued.  Investors can look for a GE Vernova stock price near $100 a share next week, according to Wall Street estimates. GE shareholders will get one GEV share for each four shares of GE held, and GE Vernova will have fewer shares outstanding than GE.  At that price, GE Vernova\u2014which will have fewer shares outstanding than GE\u2014is worth about $25 of GE\u2019s current stock price. It would value the company in the range of 17 times estimated 2025 free cash flow. At the $100 level for GE Vernova, it would mean GE Aerospace is trading for about $150 a share, giving it a market capitalization of about $165 billion and valuing that company in the range of 25 to 27 times estimated 2025 free cash flow. If GEV stock trades above the $100 level, it means GE Aerospace is valued at less than that\u2014and vice versa.  Whatever happens, the value of GE Vernova plus GE Aerospace in a portfolio will be close to the overall value of General Electric before the spinoff. When the spin is complete, the value of both stakes will change based on what happens to each company.  The when-issued trading, and the final spin, will create some volatility for GE investors next week. Only time will tell if the investors will bid up the stock for the 12th week in a row.   Through midday trading Friday, GE stock is up about 96% over the past 12 months, outperforming the \n        S&P 500\n       by about 66 percentage points.  That\u2019s quite a run.

            "text": "\nJapan Airlines\n       is planning to order more \n        Boeing\n       planes. Any order is good news, but how the order, announced on Thursday, broke down between Boeing and its rival \n        Airbus\n       should make investors take note.  The carrier said it would introduce 42 new aircraft to its fleet\u201432 from \n        Airbus\n       and 10 from Boeing.  The 10 Boeing jets are the 737 MAX 9. JAL is ordering 21 \n        Airbus\n       A350 jets, wide-body jets that compete with the Boeing 777 and 787 jets. JAL has A350 jets in its fleet today and eventually will end up with some 50 A350 jets and roughly 150 Boeing wide-body jets.  JAL is also ordering 11 Airbus A321neo jets, which are single-aisle jets. Today, JAL flies only single-aisle Boeing 737s.  Boeing has, essentially, lost an exclusive single-aisle customer.  \u201dBoeing\u2019s market share in Northeast Asia is doing well\u2026at about 65%,\u201d the company told Barron\u2019s on Thursday.  The number represents the combined market share including both wide-body, twin-aisle jets and narrow-body, single-aisle jets.   One reason for the switch looks to be size. An A321 is a little larger than the A320, seating up to 240 passengers depending on the layout an airline chooses. An A320 seats up to 180 people.  The Boeing 737 MAX 8\u2019s maximum seating capacity is listed at 210, while the larger MAX 9 is listed at 220. The MAX 10 is closer to the A321neo, with a maximum capacity of 230 people, but the MAX 10 isn\u2019t approved for commercial service. Approval looks to be at least a year away.  At first glance, the differences don\u2019t seem all that significant. The A321neo, after all, is only a couple of feet longer than the 737 MAX 10. But the differences matter to airlines.  Airbus has taken more than 6,100 orders of A321neo jets. Boeing has taken about 1,600 orders for the MAX 9 and 10.  Overall MAX orders, including the MAX 7 and MAX 8, total some 7,800 units. A320neo and A321neo orders total some 10,000 planes.   It looks as if Boeing could use a new medium-size aircraft to better compete with the A321neo. A new plane takes billions of dollars and years to develop.  Boeing has been busy with other challenges. Its MAX jet was grounded worldwide between March 2019 and November 2020 following two deadly crashes. That crisis has passed, but in January, an emergency- door plug blew out of a 737 MAX 9 operated by \n        Alaska Air.\n       That has led to slower production and more regulatory oversight.  The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that airline CEOs are meeting with Boeing to discuss its recent production problems.  Overall, the JAL order is better news for Airbus than for Boeing. And the European plane maker enjoyed another win early Thursday as Korean Air announced a $13.7 billion contract to buy 33 Airbus A350 planes as it prepares to merge with \n        Asiana Airlines.\n       Both Korean Air and Asiana fly a mixture of Boeing and Airbus planes.\u00a0 In early trading, Boeing stock was up. The gains have faded and the stock was roughly flat at $187.90 in the afternoon. Airbus edged 01% higher in European trading. The \n        S&P 500\n       and \n        Nasdaq Composite\n       were both up about 0.6%.   That Boeing stock could climb even briefly on seemingly bad news is partly because the shares are badly beaten up. Coming into Thursday trading, the stock was down 28% for the year. Airbus shares were up 20%.  Gains may have also faded thanks to Wall Street. BofA Securities analyst Ron Epstein cut his price target to $210 a share from $225. He maintained his Hold rating.  Epstein lowered his free cash flow estimates given the 737-related turmoil. He expects Boeing to generate $686 million in free cash flow this year, $4.8 billion in 2025, and $6.1 billion in 2026. His previous estimates were $4.2 billion, $6.3 billion, and $8 billion, respectively. Overall, 69% of analysts covering the stock rate shares Buy. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&P 500 is about 55%, according to FactSet. The average analyst price target for Boeing stock is about $256.

            "text": "This Saturday, March 23, will mark four years since the major indexes bottomed out as pandemic lockdowns pressed pause on the global economy and raised fears of a prolonged crash.  What played out afterward was far different from the initial projections \u2014 an unhinged 2021 and a 2022 that, marked by snarled supply chains, caused a spike in prices for food and essentials, which have largely remained elevated ever since. But, even as the broader market recovered, the share prices of dozens of companies, including some very well-known ones, are still below where they were in early 2020 \u2014 for any number of reasons.  They include shares of companies that were hardest hit by pandemic restrictions, like Delta Air Lines Inc. \n        DAL,\n        -0.22%\n       and United Airlines Holdings Inc. \n        UAL,\n        -1.46%,\n       which, respectively, remain 26.9% and 48.7% off their highest closing levels in the first quarter of 2020. But since then, despite a surge in what came to be known as revenge travel, the airline industry has faced other issues, including volatile fuel prices, limited aircraft availability, understaffing and other disruptions to travel. Boeing Co. \n        BA,\n        +0.31%,\n       which makes many of the planes those airlines fly, has had different problems. Shares of Boeing are 45.7% lower than their first-quarter 2020 high, after a midair door-panel blowout on a 737 Max plane in January led to deep scrutiny of the company\u2019s production standards.  Toy demand got a bump during the pandemic but slowed as the economy reopened and the ensuing inflation steered spending elsewhere. Hasbro Inc. \n        HAS,\n        -0.63%\n       is still trying to recover, and its shares are down 48% from their first-quarter 2020 peak. Hasbro has popular games like Dungeons & Dragons under its umbrella. But, unlike rival Mattel Inc. \n        MAT,\n        -0.62%,\n       it didn\u2019t have \u201cBarbie,\u201d a film that dominated the box office last year, and Hasbro has cut staff and forecast a continued slowdown in sales.  Anheuser-Busch InBev shares \n        BUD,\n        +0.38%\n       are 28.3% lower than their closing high in 2020\u2019s first quarter. The stock last year took a hit due to a sharp drop in Bud Light sales, following a conservative boycott campaign in response to Bud Light\u2019s promotional partnership with a transgender influencer. More broadly, demand for light beer has fallen in recent years, largely because customers have migrated to other options. Elsewhere, Citigroup Inc. \n        C,\n        +1.71%,\n       which is exiting businesses abroad, is off 25.9% from its first-quarter 2020 high. Intel Corp. \n        INTC,\n        -9.20%,\n       whose recent financial forecasts have disappointed investors, is down 37%, though it was up 2% at midday Thursday and was one of the driving forces behind a 350-point Dow industrials \n        DJIA\n       surge.       Oversold rally earlier this week doesn\u2019t erase the U.S.  market\u2019s negative picture. Bill Peters is a Los Angeles-based MarketWatch reporter who covers earnings.

            "text": "By Mauro Orru Korean Air Lines said it would sign a contract with Airbus to procure 33 A350 wide-body jets in a deal valued at $13.7 billion, as the airline seeks to strengthen its long-haul fleet while it gradually retires older aircraft. The South Korean flag carrier said Thursday that the deal with the European plane maker is set to include 27 A350-1000s and six A350-900s, which it plans to deploy on routes such as Seoul to New York. While Korean Air said the deal would be valued at $13.7 billion, buyers typically receive steep discounts for big orders. The A350-1000 is the largest aircraft in Airbus's A350 family type and can accommodate from 350 to 410 passengers in a standard three-class configuration. The A350-900 is roughly 7 meters shorter, and typically seats 300 to 350 passengers in a three-class layout. Korean Air said the deal would also help in its efforts to integrate rival Asiana Airlines after the European Union last month granted conditional approval for the $1.29 billion acquisition. On Thursday, Japan Airlines said it plans to buy 42 airplanes from Airbus and Boeing to be delivered over the next decade, seeking to expand its full-service and low-cost carrier businesses to capture international travel demand. The Japanese carrier said it intends to acquire 21 A350-900 and 11 A321neo planes from Airbus and 10 787 jets from Boeing, though it didn't disclose financial details. The potential orders for Airbus come as rival Boeing is grappling with the fallout from an Alaska Airlines emergency landing in January after a section of the aircraft ripped away in midair, prompting a temporary grounding and immediate inspections of dozens of Boeing 737 MAX jets.

            "text": "The Bank of England left interest rates unchanged on Thursday. Now the question is how quickly it can start to lower the benchmark. Like the Federal Reserve, the U.K. central bank has seen inflation slow rapidly over the past year. But unlike in the U.S., the U.K. economy has been weak, falling into recession in the second half of 2023. On Wednesday, the Fed published new forecasts that maintained expectations for three quarter-point rate reductions this year, which sent markets soaring. Switzerland on Thursday became the first major central bank to start lowering rates in this cycle. Other things being equal, it should be easier for the BOE to start lowering borrowing costs than for the Fed\u2014since weaker growth puts downward pressure on prices.  But policymakers in the U.K. are still concerned that inflation could remain sticky. At the previous rate decision in February, two BOE rate setters voted to increase interest rates, while one voted for a reduction, creating a three-way split on the committee. This time, the vote was 8-1 to keep the benchmark at 5.25%, with one member voting for a reduction. \u201cThe restrictive stance of monetary policy is weighing on activity in the real economy, is leading to a looser labor market and is bearing down on inflationary pressures,\u201d the bank said in a statement. \u201cNonetheless, key indicators of inflation persistence remain elevated.\u201d The bank\u2019s latest forecasts, published last month, showed inflation hitting the 2% target in the first half, and then accelerating again later in the year. The inflation rate fell to 3.4% in February from 4% in January, a bigger drop than expected, data published Wednesday showed. Most economists anticipate the first U.K. rate cut in August. The market is pricing in about a 70% probability of the first Fed cut coming in June, according to the CME FedWatch tool. BOE Governor Andrew Bailey won\u2019t hold a press conference after Thursday\u2019s decision. The bank next updates its forecasts at its May meeting. \u201cThe Committee will keep under review for how long bank rate should be maintained at its current level,\u201d policy makers said.

Japan Airlines said Thursday that it intends to acquire 10 787 jets from Boeing and 32 from Airbus, comprising 21 A350-900 and 11 A321neo planes. The Japanese airline didn't disclose the cost of the acquisition. Catalog prices of the 42 airplanes total 1.870 trillion yen ($12.36 billion), according to figures provided by the company. The Japanese company said it expects an aircraft supply shortage going forward due to a relative lack of production capacity at plane makers and wanted to secure jets early to stay competitive. It plans to acquire one A350-900 jet to replace the plane it lost due to a collision in January at Tokyo's Haneda Airport. Boeing slowed production of its bestselling 737 MAX jets in recent weeks as it faced increased scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration and the Justice Department following the Alaska Airlines midair blowout. Japan Airlines projects demand to grow further for international tourism to Japan over the next couple of years, though a recovery in outbound travel will likely be slower. High inflation and geopolitical risks will likely persist, while decarbonization is expected to accelerate, the company said. It said it aims to limit carbon emissions by acquiring more fuel-efficient aircraft. Japan Airlines expects higher revenue and net profit for the year starting in April, thanks partly to a recovery in international travel. It forecasts Y100.00 billion net profit on revenue of Y1.930 trillion, compared with the latest projections of Y90.00 billion net profit and Y1.653 trillion revenue for the year ending March 31.

These stocks were making moves Wednesday:\u00a0 The board of \n        Chipotle Mexican Grill\n       approved a 50-for-1 split\u00a0of the fast-casual restaurant chain\u2019s common stock. It is the first stock split in the company\u2019s 30-year history. Jack Hartung, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said the split will make Chipotle\u2019s stock \u201cmore accessible to employees as well as a broader range of investors.\u201d Chipotle shares rose 3.5% to $2,895. \nNvidia\n       CEO Jensen Huang said at the company\u2019s \n        GTC\n       conference that there were about $1 trillion of installed data centers in the world, and the chip maker expects to take a larger share of the roughly $250 billion spent a year for data center infrastructure. He also said the company wasn\u2019t just a chip maker. \u201cNvidia builds an entire data center for AI,\u201d Huang said during an analysts\u2019 Q&A session. Nvidia shares rose 1.1% on Wednesday after closing 1.1% higher on Tuesday.  \nBoeing\n       gained 3.7% even as Chief Financial Officer Brian West said the aerospace company would be using $4 billion to $4.5 billion of cash flow in the first quarter, more than analysts\u2019 projections, largely because of production problems.  U.S.-listed shares of \n        PDD Holdings\n       rose 3.5% after the parent company of budget online retailers Pinduoduo and Temu reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that were well ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations. \nMobileye Global\n       rose 7.5%. The Israeli software company said it was expanding its relationship with Volkswagen, providing the German auto maker with more advanced assisted and autonomous driving software. \nJetBlue Airways\n       said it plans to exit several cities and would be reducing flights out of Los Angeles as the carrier focuses on its better-performing routes. The move also will help when the airline has fewer aircraft available,\u00a0JetBlue said. The airline will be exiting the cities of Bogot\u00e1, Colombia; Quito, Ecuador; Lima, Peru; and Kansas City, Mo. JetBlue shares were up 6.9%. \nSignet Jewelers\n       posted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings that beat analysts\u2019 expectations but the stock fell 12% after the company issued fiscal first-quarter and year forecasts that missed estimates. Fourth-quarter profit at \n        BioNTech,\n       the German biotechnology company, fell sharply, weighed down by inventory write-downs by Covid-19 vaccine partner \n        Pfizer.\n       American depositary receipts of \n        BioNTech\n       fell 4.4%.  \nRiot Platforms\n       rose12% to $12.40 after shares of the Bitcoin miner were upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at \n        J.P. Morgan\n       and the price target was left unchanged at $15. \nGeneral Mills\n       was up 1.2% after the maker of Cheerios and other packaged foods reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings. The company affirmed its fiscal-year guidance for adjusted earnings and organic sales growth. \nGildan Activewear\n       rose 1.7% on Wednesday and jumped 10% on Tuesday as the T-shirt maker said it received a \u201cconfidential nonbinding expression of interest\u201d to acquire it. The company set up a special board committee which contacted a \u201csmall number of reputable potential counterparties\u201d with several expressing an \u201cinterest in considering a potential friendly transaction with Gildan.\u201d \nIntel\n       gained 0.4% after the company said the Commerce Department has proposed up to $8.5 billion in direct funding to the chip maker from the Chips and Science Act. Intel said the funds will support building new chip factories in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. The company also expects to be eligible for federal loans up to $11 billion and to receive a tax credit benefit on up to 25% of more than $100 billion in qualified investments.

            "title": "Boeing\u2019s CFO Hammers Hopes for Cash Flow. The Stock Is Up.",
            "text": "\nBoeing\n       CFO Brian West spoke about quality manufacturing practices, company supplier \n        Spirit AeroSystems,\n       and cash flow with investors at a \n        BofA\n       Securities conference Wednesday morning. It wasn\u2019t clear that investors liked what they heard. Boeing shares dipped initially but then recovered as investors considered what comments meant for cash flow in 2024 and in the coming years.  While Boeing stock was down about 2% in premarket trading, it rebounded early and shares closed at $187.78, up 3.7%. The \n        S&P 500\n       and \n        Nasdaq Composite\n       rose 0.9% and 1.3%, respectively, boosted by Federal Reserve documents that show the central bank still plans to cut interest rates sometime in 2024.  BofA analyst Ron Epstein led the discussion, asking questions on the minds of all investors\u2014particularly about production quality\u2014in the aftermath of the Jan. 5 emergency door plug blowout on a 737 MAX 9 jet operated by \n        Alaska Air.\n       Missing bolts were blamed in a preliminary accident report.  Spirit AeroSystems made the fuselage, which required some rework at the Boeing plant.  \u201cNow, we will only accept a fully conforming fuselage from Spirit,\u201d said West. \u201cThere might be some variability of supply.\u201d  That\u2019s a quality improvement. How often Boeing would receive a nonconforming fuselage isn\u2019t known. Boeing didn\u2019t provide that detail when asked.   Boeing is also prioritizing finishing assembly work on schedule versus the flow in the factory.  \u201cTraveled work has existed for a very long time,\u201d added West. Traveled work refers to doing a task at a different spot in the assembly line than originally intended. \u201cOnce you\u2026reduce traveled work\u2026your quality gets better, your stability gets better.\u201d  West also made it sound as if Boeing and Spirit Aero merger talks are moving ahead. Boeing sold Spirit to private equity in 2005, but earlier this month, the two companies confirmed they were in discussions about Boeing acquiring its fuselage provider. Boeing \u201cprobably got a little too far ahead of itself on the topic of outsourcing,\u201d West said. \u201cWe believe and Spirit believes, that reintegrating these two companies is what\u2019s best for safety and for quality.\u201d Spirit Aero stock is up about $4 a share to almost $33 a share since Boeing and Spirit Aero began talks earlier this month. Shares closed at $35.11, up 6.5% on Wednesday.  Benchmark analyst Josh Sullivan says a deal is looking more likely. \u201dBy bringing Spirit in-house [Boeing] can make a major change\u201d that shows customers and regulators it\u2019s working to address recent shortcomings.    Of course, all of these changes to improve production quality have a cost. \u201cAs we have decided to hold airplanes in position longer and get after this traveled work\u2026it is going to impact revenue, earnings, and cash flow both in the quarter and the year,\u201d West said.  Boeing will use $4 billion to $4.5 billion in the first quarter. For the full year, free cash flow should be in the \u201clow single-digit\u201d billions.  That\u2019s worse than Wall Street expects. For the first quarter, Wall Street was projecting a cash use of $1.5 billion. For the full year, Wall Street was predicting positive free cash flow of $5 billion\u2014a number in the mid-single-digit billions.  \u201cCash slash,\u201d is how Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard characterized West\u2019s comments in a Wednesday report.  \u201cThe first step towards fixing a problem is acknowledging that it exists,\u201d added Stallard. \u201cBoeing\u2019s cut to its free cash flow guidance is an overdue recognition of the situation it is in, but we still worry that it is being overly optimistic. It has no guarantee [about] what the FAA\u2019s conclusion will be on the 737, and it is currently producing way below the official rate of 38 per month.\u201d  Stallard rates Boeing stock Hold and has a $230 price target for shares. Sullivan rates shares Buy. His price target is $250 a share. Overall, 69% of analysts covering the stock rate shares Buy. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&P 500 is about 55%. The average analyst price target for Boeing stock is about $261 a share.  Analysts\u2019 stock price targets might come under pressure as Wall Street digests West\u2019s cash comments.  Lower targets, and lower cash flows, could pressure shares, but Boeing stock is already badly beaten up. So far this year, shares have dropped 28%.

            "text": "Regulatory News: TotalEnergies (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) publishes its Sustainability & Climate -- 2024 Progress Report, as pledged by the Board of Directors since 2020. This report gives an account of the implementation the Company's strategy and the progress made in 2023 with regard to the objectives for 2030, notably its achievements in terms of emissions reductions and its contribution to a just, orderly and equitable energy transition for all its stakeholders. TotalEnergies thus reaffirms the relevance of its balanced multi-energy strategy combining profitable growth and sustainable development, anchored on two pillars: oil & gas, notably LNG, and electricity, notably renewable, the energy at the heart of the transition. In 2023, like in 2022, TotalEnergies was the most profitable major, with a return on capital employed of 19%, while also being the major that invests the most in the energy transition. In Oil & Gas, thanks to having refocused its portfolio on assets and projects with low breakeven and low greenhouse gas emissions, TotalEnergies intends to produce oil & gas in a responsible manner, as illustrated by its 2023 achievements in emissions reductions: In gas, energy of the transition which complements the intermittency of renewable energies in electricity generation and represents a virtuous alternative for countries burning coal for their power generation needs, the Company estimates that its LNG sales contributed to avoiding about 70 Mt of CO(2) e emissions worldwide in 2023. In electricity, TotalEnergies invested more than $5 billion in 2023 in low-carbon energies, essentially in electricity, contributing to building a profitable and differentiated Integrated Power business, which will both become a cash engine for the Company and reduce the emissions resulting from the use of energy products sold to its clients: the lifecycle carbon intensity of energy products sold by TotalEnergies to its customers for final use was 13% lower in 2023 compared to 2015, and is on track to meet the objective of -25% by 2030. Thanks to these achievements, TotalEnergies confirms its ambition to become a major player in the energy transition, committed to carbon neutrality in 2050, together with society. Moreover, with the launch of Care Together by TotalEnergies, the Company increases its commitments in terms of social responsibility. In addition to commitments specific to each affiliate, TotalEnergies guarantees compliance with high social standards for all its employees worldwide, regardless of the legislation in force in any given country. This program is based on concrete measures revolving around four pillars: social protection, health, the family sphere and working conditions.

            "text": "It\u2019s not just airlines exposed to \n        Boeing\n       that are grappling with the prospect of fewer planes. \nJetBlue Airways\n       is cutting a number of weaker-performing routes in order to prioritize its stronger routes when limited aircraft are available. The stock rose 1.3% in early trading Wednesday after initially falling at the open. The low-cost carrier said Tuesday it is exiting Bogot\u00e1, Colombia; Quito, Ecuador; Lima, Peru; and Kansas City. It will also not resume service to Newburgh, N.Y., which was suspended in 2020. Nine routes out of Los Angeles are being discontinued, along with five routes linked to Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Some other routes are being made seasonal. \u201cThese moves will allow us to redeploy our fleet to increase frequencies on well-performing routes from \n        JetBlue\n      \u2018s focus cities while continuing to increase crucial ground time for our aircraft, reducing the chance of delays for our customers,\u201d a JetBlue spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \nSouthwest Airlines\n       and Irish carrier \n        Ryanair\n       are cutting flights this year as they expect to receive fewer \n        Boeing\n       planes than initially expected, following turmoil engulfing the aircraft maker that has slowed production. \n        Alaska Air Group\n       said its full-year capacity plans are still in flux.\u00a0 JetBlue doesn\u2019t fly any Boeing planes\u2014its fleet was made up of 247 \n        Airbus\n       aircraft and 53 Embraer planes as of the end of 2023. But the airline is being impacted by problems with GTF engines made by \n        RTX\n      -owned Pratt & Whitney. RTX said in July last year that engines in some Airbus jets will need to be removed and inspected due to a rare metal powder defect that could cause some components to crack. JetBlue had six aircraft grounded for inspection at the turn of the year and said that could rise to up to 15 by the end of 2024, in its annual 10-k report last month. \u201cThe changes will also help us during a time when aircraft availability is limited\u2014particularly with some of our aircraft grounded to due to Pratt & Whitney GTF inspections,\u201d a company spokesperson added. The airline is planning for a future without \n        Spirit Airlines\n       after its proposed merger with the ultra-low-cost carrier was blocked by a federal judge, and then terminated by the companies earlier this month. The airline\u2019s new CEO, Joanna Geraghty, vowed to take \u201caggressive action\u201d to return it to profitability when she took over last month. She has already announced plans to defer $2.5 billion in aircraft spending and other cost-cutting measures. The company has also faced activist investor pressure after Carl Icahn disclosed a 9.9% stake. Icahn won two board seats last month. UBS analysts initiated coverage on U.S. airlines late Tuesday and said they were positive on the sector, citing expectations for cost pressure to moderate and margins to start moving higher. However, they initiated a Sell rating on JetBlue, citing its exposure to GTF engines and its pilot pay contract being up for renewal in early 2025. JetBlue didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment early Wednesday.

            "text": "Fed day is finally here, and hopefully, the answer to burning questions about rate-cutting plans from the world\u2019s most important central bank.  As we wait to see how the Fed\u2019s words play out on Wall Street, our call of the day,is  from the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, Tom Lee, who says there will be a post-decision rally, offering five reasons for that. One of Wall Street\u2019s biggest and most enduring bulls, Lee correctly called the 2023 equity rally and sees the S&P 500 \n        SPX\n       ending 2024 at 5,200, which he has said may be too conservative. Lee acknowledges pre-Fed investor caution, which he attributes to January\u2019s red-hot inflation data and easing financial conditions. He also finds investors seemingly in disbelief that stocks continue to rise despite January\u2019s hot CPI data, recession worries, extreme valuations, still dominant Big Tech and hype around AI.  So in order for stocks to rally, some kind of surprise or relief element would be needed, which he expects. In the first of his five reasons, Lee talks about how stocks have been easing just a bit into the Fed meeting, which puts the odds in favor of equity gains. \u201cWhen you look at the last two years worth of rate decisions, when stocks are soft into the FOMC, they rally four out of seven times. It\u2019s not a high probability\u2026but it just shows you that there are things that can improve the odds, but at least the base case is that it\u2019s probable that we rally after the FOMC,\u201d Lee tells clients in an update.  The second reason surrounds softening interest rates, which can work in equities\u2019 favor. Fundstrat\u2019s head of technical strategy Mark Newton sees the 10-year Treasury yield at a peak:  Thirdly, the market has already priced in \u201cbad news\u201d \u2014 three instead of seven interest rate cuts that may not start until September.  Fourth, Fed Chair Jerome Powell was dovish to Congress earlier this month, and the strategist sees no reason why he would shift that stance on Wednesday.  Finally, the \u201cgas-in-the-tank,\u201d reason and for that, Fundstrat\u2019s Newton has laid out a bullish technical setup. \u201cWe find investors become reflexively bearish every time the market starts to wobble.\u2002As long as \u2018top calling\u2019 remains the default mode, we think stocks are likely to continue to surprise to the upside,\u201d says Lee. Fundstrat sees the S&P 500 possibly reaching 5,250 to 5,300 in the aftermath of Wednesday\u2019s meeting. Lee says the \u201cskepticism towards equities is still prevalent among institutional investors that we have visited with recently.\u2002And this caution, coupled with their expectation of a \u2018hawkish\u2019 Fed is the reason we expect stocks to rally.\u201d  Read: Options traders are reining in their bullish stock-market bets As for where to invest, despite some recent wariness around Nvidia, Lee says investors should \u201cstick with what is working\u201d this year, such as the AI theme \u2014 Nvidia \n        NVDA,\n        +6.02%,\n       Cadence Design Systems \n        CDNS,\n        +2.34%,\n       Arm Holdings \n        ARM,\n        +3.84%,\n       Advanced Micro Devices \n        AMD,\n        +2.28%\n       and the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF \n        AIQ.\n Also don\u2019t shed those weight-loss linked stocks such as Eli Lilly \n        LLY,\n        +1.28%\n       and Novo Nordisk \n        NVO,\n        +0.85%\n       or financials via Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF \n        XLI\n       and industrials via Financial Select Sector SPDR \n        XLF.\n       He also is sticking with bitcoin and its proxies \u2014 Marathon Digital \n        MARA,\n        +1.37%,\n       PayPal \n        PYPL,\n        +3.34%,\n       Coinbase \n        COIN,\n        +4.57%\n       and MicroStrategy \n        MSTR,\n        +2.59%.\n Stocks \n        SPX\nCOMP\n       are struggling for traction, with bond yields \n        BX:TMUBMUSD10Y\nBX:TMUBMUSD02Y\n       also largely unchanged pre-Fed.

            "text": "Boeing Co.\u2019s chief financial officer on Wednesday said cash flow will be worse than the company had expected even back in January as the troubled plane maker focuses on quality after a spate of incidents. CFO Brian West told a Bank of America conference that lower deliveries, a worse mix and working capital pressure are all contributing to a hit of between $4 billion and $4.5 billion for the current quarter. Some of that, he added, will not be made up by the end of the year. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast a $1 billion decline in cash flow from operations. Boeing shares \n        BA,\n        +0.32%\n       slipped in premarket trade, but reversed course to rise more than 2% later Wednesday. The stock has dived by 29% this year, contrasting with an advance of around 9% for the S&P 500 index \n        SPX\n       in the same period. \u201cFor years we prioritized the movement of airplanes in the factory over getting it done right and that has got to change,\u201d said West. Citi analyst Jason Gursky, commenting on West\u2019s guidance, said the \u201clong-term thesis [is] intact but near-term catalysts appear scarce.\u201d Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said that the guidance cut was \u201coverdue,\u201d and that it might still be \u201coverly optimistic.\u201d  Boeing \u201chas no guarantee on what the FAA\u2019s conclusion will be on the 737, and it is currently producing way below the official rate of 38/month. Withpotential Spirit integration risk on top and some of its Defense programs still struggling we think Boeing would be better off ditching the [$10 billion] FCF target until it has made more progress sorting out its myriad of problems,\u201d Stallard said in a note. Boeing has previously said it was lowering the production rate on the 737 to below 38 per month. West, as he previously has stated, said it will be up to the Federal Aviation Administration to determine when the company can begin increasing production. Boeing has been under intense pressure since a fuselage panel flew off an Alaska Airlines 737 Max jet in January. More recently, Boeing told airlines to check 787 cockpit seats after a sudden plunge led to injuries. West talked about getting \u201ctraveled work\u201d down and quality up as he reiterated the company may acquire contractor Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. \n        SPR,\n        +2.33%.\n       \u201cIt\u2019s really about focus, running that business as a factory rather than a business,\u201d West said. Any deal would be financed by cash and debt and not by equity, he added. He said Boeing will only accept a fully conforming fuselage from Spirit at its Washington state factory. West added that achieving an investment-grade rating is still a priority but it will be on a timeline further out than 2025 to 2026. West did note that both the 787 and 737 are sold firm through 2028. \u201cCommercial demand continues to be robust,\u201d said West. Claudia Assis in San Francisco contributed.

            "text": "The pound and U.K. government bond yields fell Wednesday after a report showed inflation at its lowest in more than two years, raising hopes that the Bank of England can soon start trimming borrowing costs. Britain\u2019s central bank is widely expected to leave its main interest rate at 5.25% on Thursday. However, news that consumer prices grew in the year to February by 3.4%, down from 4% in January, and the weakest reading since September 2021, saw traders bolster bets of a 25 basis point rate cut in June.  \u201cA much more manageable 3.4%, cooler than had been expected, has already impacted market expectation of how many rate cuts the Bank of England might be able to push through by the end of the year,\u201d said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. \u201cMoney markets are once again pricing in four or even the off chance of five cuts [of 25 basis points apiece] by the end of the year, where yesterday just three seemed possible,\u201d Hewson added. Marc Cogliatti, head of capital markets, EMEA at Validus Risk Management, noted that the headline inflation rate \u201cwas also below the Bank of England\u2019s own forecasts implying there may be a little more scope for the Monetary Policy Committee to ease than previously thought.\u201d \u201cThis message was reinforced by a dip in the core reading which fell from 5.1% in January to 4.6% in February,\u201d Cogliatti added. Yields on the monetary policy-sensitive 2-year gilt \n        BX:TMBMKGB-02Y\n       fell 5.2 basis points to 4.234%, close to a two-month low, while the pound \n        GBPUSD,\n        -0.18%\n       dipped 0.2% to trade below $1.27. The U.K. currency hit an eight-month peak near $1.29 less than two weeks ago as investors built bets that the British economy was faring better than many observers thought it would and that inflation was proving stubbornly sticky. However, since then slower wage growth data has shown easing pressures in the jobs market, which when combined with the latest consumer prices report means the market is now poised for a dovish BOE on Thursday, according to Kathleen Brooks, analyst at XTB. \u201cWith progress made on wage increases and inflation, there is a chance no one will vote for a hike at this meeting. This could be seen as a step closer to the BOE cutting interest rates,\u201d said Brooks. The FTSE 100 equity index \n        UK:UKX\n       was down 0.2% but the more domestically focused and rate-sensitive FTSE 250 index \n        UK:MCX\n       rose 0.1%.   Alphabet shares surge after Google\u2019s parent posts better-than-expected earnings and announces its first cash dividend, Microsoft posts 31% quarterly growth in Azure cloud-computing revenue, and Exxon Mobil\u2019s earnings miss estimates.

            "text": "Bitcoin is up to its old tricks again. Despite taking a large step toward mainstream acceptance, and a huge leap to fresh all-time highs, the cryptocurrency reminded investors Tuesday that a wild swing lower is never that far away. The price of Bitcoin tumbled below $63,000 after hitting a record high close to $74,000 last week. While it\u2019s always difficult to assign a value to crypto assets, the bull case for Bitcoin can still be made. The approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January has increased interest among institutional and retail investors. It has also accelerated the move toward mainstream acceptance and ETFs last week posted record inflows. The so-called halving event, which cuts the rate at which new tokens are issued, is expected next month and historically helps push prices higher. Appetite for riskier assets in general, such as high-growth technology stocks, also aids digital assets\u2014the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is sitting just below its record high. But the price correction provides a major test for Bitcoin and its recent resurgence. It\u2019s the asset\u2019s biggest fall in value since spot ETFs began trading.  If surging inflows helped Bitcoin reach new highs, then a mass exodus may well have the opposite effect. On the flip side, if those who have bought into Bitcoin ETFs prove to be unfazed by the price action it could shore up the asset\u2019s recent strength. The answer to that question won\u2019t be clear for a while but Tuesday did mark record daily net outflows of $326.2 million from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, according to data from BitMEX Research. However, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust accounted for $444 million in outflows but it does highlight a lack of buying among other funds. Bitcoin is at a crossroads\u2014it\u2019s time for the investors who have joined the crypto party this year to show whether they are in it for the long haul or just to take profits. \u2014Callum Keown \nMicrosoft\n       has hired artificial intelligence entrepreneur Mustafa Suleyman and Kar\u00e9n Simonyan from Inflection AI, a start-up, to run its new Microsoft AI arm, which will be responsible for the Copilot chatbot and its other generative AI software. The move raises questions about Microsoft\u2019s future plans for OpenAI. What\u2019s Next: Inflection\u2019s new CEO is Sean White, a board member and previously chief R&D officer at Mozilla. Inflection said it would continue to test and fine-tune its custom generative AI models for commercial customers, and will host its Inflection-2.5 software on Microsoft Azure. \u2014Janet H. Cho and Eric J.

President Joe Biden and congressional leaders announced the deal, and Biden urged its swift passage to avoid a partial shutdown. What\u2019s Next: There\u2019s a chance the voting won\u2019t be complete by Friday\u2019s deadline, which means a partial government shutdown while the process is completed, or a last-minute extension. Both the House and Senate are scheduled to recess for two weeks starting Saturday. \u2014Liz Moyer In a year that had fewer mergers and initial public offerings, greater stock market volatility, regional bank failures, and less generous compensation policies, the size of the average Wall Street bonus dropped to the lowest level since 2019, according to New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli.

At the time, she was very close to dying of cancer, and had three teenage children, so she begged her brother to pay her kids $50,000 whenever he recovered financially. So he promised he would do that, and she informed her kids that he would do this.

Will his estate have to sell the house out from under his two kids? He has signed a transfer-on-death deed to his kids, but I told him that I don\u2019t think that protects the house from being sold to pay off any debts at his death.

            "title": "U.K. inflation falls by more than expected in February, triggering talk of lower interest rates",
            "text": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Price rises in the U.K. eased by more than anticipated in February, official figures showed Wednesday, raising expectations that the Bank of England may start cutting interest rates in the next few months. The Office for National Statistics said inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell to 3.4%, its lowest level since September 2021, from 4% in January. The agency said easing food price inflation was largely behind the fall. The decrease was bigger than anticipated. Analysts had expected a decline to 3.6%. The yield on the 2-year gilt \n        BX:TMBMKGB-02Y\n       fell 10 basis points to 4.19%. The pound \n        GBPUSD,\n        -0.18%\n       fell to $1.2696 from $1.2723 on Tuesday. Inflation is still running higher than the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2% but the direction of the move is clear. Inflation hit a high above 11% at the end of 2022 in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which led to sharp increases in energy costs. The bigger-than-anticipated decline comes a day before the nine rate-setters at the bank announce their latest interest rate decision. The view in financial markets is that they will keep the main interest rate at a 16-year high of 5.25%. \u201cSo far, the BoE has been reluctant to give very strong guidance about the precise timing of the first cut. But after two years of economic stagnation following the massive gas supply shock in early 2022, policymakers will likely be hoping to take their foot off the monetary policy brake soon to support an already building recovery,\u201d said Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg. The meeting minutes will be assessed to see how much thought policymakers are giving to cutting interest rates, which should feed through to lower mortgage rates. \u201cThis notable decline is further evidence that the U.K. is fast approaching the finish line in its battle against surging inflation,\u201d said Suren Thiru, economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The Bank of England, like the Fed and other central banks around the world, raised interest rates aggressively in late 2021 from near zero to counter price rises first stoked by supply chain issues during the coronavirus pandemic and then Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up food and energy costs. Higher interest rates \u2014 which cool the economy by making it more expensive to borrow, thereby bearing down on spending \u2014 have contributed to bringing down inflation worldwide. Britain\u2019s governing Conservative Party hopes that lower inflation and falling interest rates may trigger a feelgood factor ahead of a general election, which has to take place by January 2025. Opinion polls show the main opposition Labour Party way ahead and headed for a big victory over the Conservatives, who have been in power since 2010. \u2014 MarketWatch contributed to this report.

            "text": "A Friday incident involving a \n        Boeing\n       jet, in which the plane lost a panel midflight, has resulted in more negative headlines for the aircraft manufacturer\u2014and generated even more questions about airplane safety. Now Boeing investors, whether they like it or not, have to prepare themselves for Monday\u2019s trading session with as much detail\u2014and context\u2014as possible.  On Friday, a \n        United Airlines\n       flight was found to be missing an external panel when it landed in Oregon. The plane involved was a 25-year-old 737 NG, or Next Generation, model. Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX jets are newer models\u2014and have essentially replaced the NG jets in the company\u2019s product lineup.  No emergency was declared and the plane is being inspected and repaired, according to United.  Still, every incident involving a Boeing plane is investor-level news after Jan. 5, when a 737 MAX 9\u2019s emergency door plug blew out during an \n        Alaska Air\n       flight. Barron\u2019s looked at aviation incidents recorded in the National Transportation Safety Board, or NTSB, database which involved Boeing and \n        Airbus\n       jets over the past 12 months. There were 53 incidents involving U.S.-registered jets operated by at least a dozen airlines during this time period, including almost a dozen plane models.  Incidents can be many things. They can happen on the tarmac while a plane is taxiing, ascending, flying midair, or landing. They can also happen anywhere in the world; the NTSB database is global.  Barron\u2019s found 37 incidents involving Boeing jets and 16 involving Airbus jets. It makes sense for Boeing to have more incidents: Major U.S. airlines have some 3,400 Boeing jets in their fleets, double the roughly 1,700 Airbus planes.    The 53 incidents work out to just over four incidents a month for a U.S.-registered commercial airline\u2014which means about 0.1% of the U.S. fleet is affected.    The data show that older planes have more issues than younger planes. Over the past 12 months, the incident rate for Boeing planes between 20 and 30 years old is about two a month. The incident rate for planes up to 10 years old is about one a month.  The incident rate for newer Airbus jets looks the same\u2014about one a month. That means newer Boeing jets slightly outperform Airbus jets, given the latter\u2019s smaller fleet. Still, the numbers are small.  Airbus jets between 20 and 30 years old have six incidents recorded in the NTSB database over the past 12 months. That\u2019s impressive\u2014but small numbers make it difficult to declare something definitive. The big takeaways: Overall incident rates are low, incidents appear to happen to older planes at a higher rate than newer jets, and numbers for Boeing and Airbus look similar\u2014on the surface.   The data also show that 47\u2014or 89%\u2014of the incidents involved planes more than three years old. Airlines have been operating almost all of the jets for years. The \u201caverage plane\u201d in the data covering the past 12 months was delivered in 2004, making it roughly 20 years old.   Boeing and Airbus didn\u2019t respond to Barron\u2019s requests for comment on our analysis. The Federal Aviation Administration said in an emailed statement: \u201dFAA regulations require aircraft to undergo regular inspections, maintenance, and parts overhauls and replacement as specified in the aircraft maintenance manual and any applicable Airworthiness Directives. The FAA also has\u00a0specific inspection requirements\u00a0for older aircraft.\u201d  Investors must consider safety data because Boeing has legitimate safety, quality, and production issues. Boeing stock was north of $440 a share before the second tragic 737 MAX crash in 2019.  This year, Boeing stock was at $249 a share before the door plug failure in January. Boeing shares closed at $182.53 on Friday, off 30% in 2024, making it the second worst-performing stock in the \n        S&P 500\n       this year. (\n        Tesla\n       stock is the worst.)  MAX issues over the past few years make all Boeing-related aviation incidents news\u2014for now. Investors simply must learn how to contextualize each incident and decide whether they represent production, design, maintenance issues\u2014or human error.  The issue involving the United flight on Friday appears to fall in the maintenance category. The FAA and NTSB should eventually weigh in on the root causes of the problem.

            "text": "\nBoeing\n       might sell part of its defense business, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.  Wall Street, and investors, will be interested in any sale. It\u2019s too early to tell exactly what might be sold, so for now, investors should prepare and watch for what\u2019s next.   Boeing declined to comment on the Bloomberg report.  Boeing\u2019s defense business, which it calls Boeing Defense, Space & Security, generated about $25 billion in 2023 sales and an operating loss of about $1.8 billion. It was the second consecutive annual loss for the unit. Fixed-price contracts and higher-than-expected inflation have been an issue for many defense contractors in recent years.  In the five years before the pandemic, the business generated an average operating profit of about $2.3 billion a year, corresponding to a profit margin of about 9%.  Wall Street expects sales to hit about $25.6 billion in 2024, up about 3%. Operating profit is projected to be positive at about $546 million.  Boeing isn\u2019t all that active in M&A. The most significant sale in the recent past was the 2005 sale of the business that is now \n        Spirit AeroSystems\n       to Canadian private-equity player Onex. Boeing is now considering buying Spirit Aero to gain more control of its manufacturing process.  Boeing bought some parts distribution in 2018 for about $4.2 billion.  Any sale that raises billions can help pay down debt. Boeing ended 2023 with about $54 billion in total debt, according to Bloomberg. That\u2019s up from about $14 billion before two Boeing 737 MAX crashes and the pandemic.  Boeing didn\u2019t generate positive free cash flow in 2019, 2020, or 2021. But it reported $2.3 billion and $4.4 billion in free cash flow in 2022 and 2023, respectively, according to FactSet. Wall Street expects $5 billion in free cash flow for 2024.  Boeing stock was up 0.7% in midday trading with the \n        S&P 500\n       up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite up about 0.4%. Through midday trading, Boeing stock was off about 31% year to date.  Those declines are mainly related to problems with the 737 MAX program. An emergency-door plug blew out of a 737 MAX 9 jet operated by \n        Alaska Air\n       on Jan. 5, leading to questions about Boeing\u2019s quality and manufacturing process as well as more oversight from the Federal Aviation Administration.

            "text": "\nAirbus\n       stock caught an upgrade to Buy. \n        Boeing\u2019s\nrecent struggles are a factor in the improved outlook.  On Tuesday, RBC analyst Ken Herbert upgraded shares of Airbus to Buy from Hold. His target for the price went to \u20ac192 ($208) from \u20ac145 ($157).  Airbus stock was up 2% in overseas trading at \u20ac166.50 a share, leaving shares up about 19% so far this year and up about 43% over the past 12 months.  \u201cWe believe the recent positive shift in sentiment has room to run as recent narrowbody share gains could expand further and investor confidence in the mid-decade targets improves,\u201d wrote Herbert.  Narrow-body planes are single-aisle jets such as the A320 and 737 MAX family of aircraft. The positive sentiment shift is the one from Boeing to Airbus as Boeing struggles through more problems with its MAX jets. The Jan. 5 midair blowout of an emergency-door plug on a MAX jet led the Federal Aviation Administration to cap Boeing\u2019s MAX production at 38 a month, but Airbus can make closer to 50 A320 jets a month. Airbus plans to take production to about 75 a month over the coming couple of years. Boeing wanted to get to 50 MAX jets a month, but additional FAA oversight will delay the increase in production.  Market share shifts slowly between Boeing and Airbus, and a tilt toward Airbus now under way isn\u2019t likely to stop for the foreseeable future, Herbert believes. That is what makes him confident that Airbus can reach its mid-decade targets. \u201cIncumbency is a powerful competitive advantage in aerospace markets,\u201d wrote Herbert. \u201cWe believe Airbus will capture about 55% of the total 2024 to 2026 narrowbody deliveries.\u201d  He projects Airbus\u2019s 2025 free cash flow will reach about \u20ac6.2 billion, similar to Wall Street estimates, and up from a projected \u20ac4.3 billion for 2024.  Herbert\u2019s stock-price target of \u20ac192 works out to about 24 times his estimate for 2025 free cash flow per share. His target price for Boeing stock is $260, about 20 times his estimate of per-share free cash flow for 2025.  Herbert rates Boeing stock Buy as well, which is the prevailing stance on Wall Street: 69% of analysts covering Boeing rate the shares at Buy. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the \n        S&P 500\n       is about 55%. The average analyst price target for Boeing shares is about $261, while the stock was at $180.09 early on Tuesday.  Overall, 83% of analysts covering Airbus stock rate shares Buy. The average analyst price target is about \u20ac169 ($184) a share.

            "title": "United Airlines CEO looks to reassure customers that airline is safe after recent incidents",
            "text": "The CEO of United Airlines says that a slew of recent incidents \u2014 ranging from a piece of aluminum skin falling off a plane to another jet losing a wheel on takeoff \u2014 will cause the airline to review its safety training for employees. CEO Scott Kirby said the airline \n        UAL,\n        -1.52%\n       was already planning an extra day of training for pilots starting in May and changes in training curriculum for newly hired mechanics. In a memo to customers on Monday, Kirby tried to reassure travelers that safety is the airline\u2019s top priority. \u201cUnfortunately, in the past few weeks, our airline has experienced a number of incidents that are reminders of the importance of safety,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile they are all unrelated, I want you to know that these incidents have our attention and have sharpened our focus.\u201d Kirby said the airline is reviewing each recent incident and will use what it learns to \u201cinform\u201d safety training and procedures. He did not give any details beyond measures that he said were already being planned, such as the extra day of training for pilots. Some of the recent incidents \u2014 such as cracks in multi-layer windshields \u2014 don\u2019t normally attract much attention, but have gained news coverage and clicks on social media because of the sheer number of events affecting one airline in a short period of time. To a degree, United may be a victim of heightened concern about air safety since January, when a\u00a0panel blew off\u00a0an Alaska Airlines \n        ALK,\n        -1.56%\n       Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.37%\n       737 Max at 16,000 feet above Oregon. Investigators say bolts securing the panel were missing. \u201cI don\u2019t see a major safety issue at United,\u201d said John Cox, former airline pilot and now a safety consultant. \u201cThe media is enhancing the events with extra scrutiny. Anything right now that happens to a United airplane makes the news.\u201d Cox said the incidents \u201care unfortunate, and they are getting a lot of attention, but I don\u2019t see that they are showing an erosion in the safety of the commercial-aviation system.\u201d In the most recent incident at United, on Friday, a chunk of the outer aluminum skin\u00a0fell off the belly\u00a0of a Boeing 737-800 that was built in 1998. Also last week, a United flight from Dallas to San Francisco suffered a hydraulic leak, and another flight bound for San Francisco returned to Australia two hours after takeoff because of an undescribed \u201cmaintenance issue.\u201d Earlier this month, a United flight returned to Houston after an\u00a0engine caught fire, and a\u00a0tire fell off\u00a0a United Boeing 777 during takeoff in San Francisco. United planes have even had mishaps while on the ground. Last month, pilots on one plane reported that rudder pedals used to steer on the runway\u00a0briefly failed\u00a0after touchdown in Newark, N.J. This month, a jet landing in Houston rolled off an airport taxiway and\u00a0got stuck in grass. Workers had to haul out moveable stairs to help passengers exit the plane. There were no injuries in any of the incidents, several of which are under investigation by federal officials.

            "title": "Week Ahead for FX, Bonds: Fed, BOJ Decisions the Highlight of a Central-Bank Meeting Spree",
            "text": "Below are the most important global events likely to affect FX and bond markets in the coming week starting Monday, March 18. A number of central-bank meetings in both Europe and Asia will be the focus of a busy week, most notably decisions by the U.S. Federal Reserve as investors hunt for clues as to the timing of a first rate cut, and by the Bank of Japan, which could opt to exit negative interest rates. Other central-bank decisions are due in China, Australia and the U.K., as well as Indonesia, Taiwan, Switzerland and Norway. Chinese economic data will be watched closely for signs of recovery at the start of the year. U.S. The Federal Reserve announces a policy decision on Wednesday, where interest rates are expected to be left on hold and markets will scrutinize any comments that provide hints on when the central bank could start lowering rates. Markets are fully pricing in a rate cut in July, with a sizeable chance of an earlier move in June, Refinitiv data show. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in testimony recently that interest rates had peaked and were likely to be cut this year. U.S. economic data continue to suggest that the economy is holding up well, while recent figures showed inflation unexpectedly rose in February, which will likely concern some policymakers. U.S. economic data releases start with housing on Tuesday, followed by weekly jobless claims and existing home sales on Thursday. JAPAN The BOJ's decision on Tuesday will be closely watched by global investors as bets have been growing recently about the central bank's imminent exit from negative interest rates and its yield-curve control policy. Analysts and investors expect the BOJ to raise its key short-term interest rate from minus 0.1% either in March or in April. Policymakers have grown more confident that a positive cycle of higher wages and higher prices is finally starting to kick in after decades of deflation, with many companies saying they will raise wages significantly this year. However, views are split on whether the BOJ should follow up by raising interest rates into positive territory, and if so, how quickly. According to people familiar with the BOJ's thinking, the bank is likely to move slowly in raising rates above zero if it does decide to end negative rates, given Japan's fragile momentum on prices. \"If the bank raises short-term rates too rapidly, it could damage the economy,\" said one of the people familiar with the BOJ's thinking. \"Any policy inaction or indication of little urgency from the BOJ could suggest that markets have gotten ahead of themselves, which may tame hawkish rate bets and potentially weigh on the yen,\" said Yeap Jun Rong, market analyst at IG. Any near-term pullback \"could still be a temporary move,\" however. CHINA After the highly-anticipated \"Two Sessions\" gathering of policymakers failed to give markets much to cheer about, fresh data for January-February will indicate whether the world's second-largest economy is picking up. Sentiment is low after February home-price data showed continued declines. That adds to views that the stimulus undertaken so far isn't doing much to boost the property sector, fanning concerns that the sector downturn will continue dragging on China's economy for some time. Figures for retail sales, fixed asset investment and industrial output are set to be released on Monday. On Wednesday, focus will be on the loan prime rate (LPR) announcement by the People's Bank of China amid expectations of more monetary-policy support in the pipeline but a lack of clarity on what shape this will take. The PBOC held its one-year medium-term lending facility unchanged on Friday, signaling that the LPR will also stay steady. Commercial banks in China are asked to price their LPR with medium-term lending facility rates. Last month, the one-year LPR, which is tied to many personal and corporate loans, was left unchanged the previous month while the five-year LPR, which is linked to mortgages, was lowered. \"The PBOC remains on a dovish tilt, but depreciation pressure on the renminbi limits room for monetary easing in China before global central banks start to cut rates,\" said Lynn Song, ING's chief economist for Greater China. HSBC economists Jing Liu and Erin Xin see more likelihood that the central bank will use liquidity tools like another cut to lenders' reserves requirement and structural tools like targeted relending rather than interest-rate cuts in the near term. EUROZONE Data in the eurozone is relatively sparse in the coming week but will still be watched given prospects of the European Central Bank cutting interest rates in the coming months and as concerns remain about the fragility of the eurozone economy even as it slowly recovers. Monday's final estimate of eurozone inflation for February will be important, while Thursday's provisional purchasing managers' surveys for March will be key for indicating how well the economy is recovering. Other surveys include the latest German ZEW survey on Tuesday, eurozone consumer confidence on Wednesday and the German Ifo sentiment indicator on Friday. Government bond supply in the eurozone will be spread across sovereigns, with smaller countries joining the four big issuers. Slovakia and Belgium will sell bonds on Monday; Finland on Tuesday; Germany on Wednesday; Spain, France and Ireland on Thursday and Italy on Friday. Eurozone benchmark issuer Germany will tap bonds at the long-end, auctioning 2044- and 2052-dated Bunds. In Scandinavia Denmark and Sweden will conduct auctions on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. U.K. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates unchanged at 5.25% when it announces its policy decision on Thursday. A relatively robust U.K. economy means most investors expect the BOE to start cutting rates later than the U.S. Fed and the ECB, but still the tone of the statement will be scrutinized for clues. Ahead of the meeting, BOE policymakers could be influenced by Wednesday's U.K. inflation data for February, which will be watched closely. Producer prices data are also due on Wednesday and the U.K.'s purchasing managers' surveys for March are released on Thursday. \"Our baseline is that [BOE] policy guidance will be unchanged, although a particularly weak inflation print...may give members enough conviction to soften language further,\" Barclays analysts said in a note. On Tuesday, the U.K. Debt Management Office will auction 2053-dated government bonds, or gilts. AUSTRALIA The Reserve Bank of Australia's policy decision on Tuesday will be the key focus of Australian bond traders next week. RBA Governor Michele Bullock is widely expected to keep the official cash rate unchanged at 4.35%. While painting a balanced view of the economic outlook, she is likely to maintain the threat of more interest-rate increases. Most economists expect that the RBA is in no rush to adjust its policy position, and will hold the line until either there is further evidence that inflation has fallen, or unemployment spikes upward. The week will end with the RBA releasing its latest report card on financial stability. CANADA Canadian inflation data for February will be watched on Tuesday for clues on whether prices are coming down sufficiently to allow the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates in the coming months. NORWAY Norges Bank, Norway's central bank, is expected to leave its key interest rate on hold at 4.5% on Thursday, with focus on the accompanying statement. Norway's solid economy means a rate cut isn't expected until later in the year. SWITZERLAND The Swiss National Bank announces a rate decision on Thursday. Investors will be watching to see whether the SNB leaves its policy rate on hold at 1.75% and waits until June to cut, or whether it opts to cut rates this month given falling inflation and its concerns about the impact of a strong Swiss franc on Swiss exporters. LATIN AMERICA Central-bank decisions are due from Brazil on Wednesday and Mexico on Thursday. INDONESIA Bank Indonesia announces a decision on Wednesday after keeping rates on hold again at its last meeting in February. BI has said it plans to start easing this year if inflation stays contained, economic growth resilient and the rupiah stable. Many economists expect it will move cautiously, with a rate cut only coming toward the end of the year if at all. UOB's Global Economics & Market Research team thinks BI will stand pat in 2024, but notes several downside risks to the Southeast Asian country's economic growth and IDR stability. These include prolonged geopolitical tensions, weaker demand from China and Japan, and slower disinflation in the U.S., which could delay Fed rate cuts and, consequently, BI's easing cycle. IDR has narrowed losses as political uncertainties ebbed after mid-February elections, but concerns of a widening fiscal deficit due to new spending programs are likely to dent sentiment, at least in the near term, the UOB team said. \"We are still of the view that IDR would join the regional FX recovery when the Fed cuts rates in June.\" It expects USD/IDR at 15,500 in 2Q and 15,200 in 3Q. TAIWAN On Thursday, it is the Taiwanese central bank's turn to decide on monetary-policy settings. The CBC stood pat at its last meeting in December, citing expectations of easing inflation, alongside concerns that cooling global economies could disrupt domestic growth. While inflation is expected to cool further in the second half of 2024, UOB's Global Economics & Market Research team sees no compelling reasons for the central bank to start cutting interest rates this year, especially as an economic growth rebound could spark price pressures. It expects CBC to stay on hold for the rest of 2024. CBC holding rates steady relative to the Fed would likely bode well for the Taiwan dollar, said the UOB team led by head of research Suan Teck Kin. An upturn in global electronics demand and the stabilization of China's economy would also aid a Taiwan dollar recovery. SINGAPORE On Monday, Enterprise Singapore will release Singapore's nonoil domestic exports for February. In January, nonoil domestic exports returned to growth in a surprising show of strength, signaling that the worst of the trade slump that has weighed on the country's economy may have passed. Nonoil domestic exports rose 16.8% in January from a year earlier, following December's 1.5% contraction.

            "text": "Boeing is telling airlines to inspect switches on pilots\u2019 seats in its 787 Dreamliner jets after a published report said an accidental cockpit-seat movement likely caused\u00a0the sudden plunge\u00a0of a LATAM Airlines plane flying to New Zealand. Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.31%\n       said Friday it recommended that airlines inspect the motorized cockpit seats the next time they perform maintenance on their 787s. The aircraft manufacturer pointed to instructions that include how to disable motors that move the seats. The company described its advisory as a \u201cprecautionary measure.\u201d It did not link the memo to what happened this week on a LATAM Airlines \nLTM,\n        +1.69%\nLTMAY,\n        -2.65%\n       flight between Australia and New Zealand. The Federal Aviation Administration said, however, that the Boeing memo was issued \u201cin response to the incident on LATAM Flight 800.\u201d The FAA said it was convening a panel of experts to review Boeing\u2019s message to airlines. LATAM Airlines, based in Chile, initially said there was \u201ca technical event during the flight which caused a strong movement.\u201d In an update Tuesday, the airline said the plane \u201cexperienced a strong shake during flight, the cause of which is currently under investigation.\u201d Passengers reported that when the Dreamliner dropped without warning, people not wearing seatbelts were\u00a0tossed from their seats\u00a0and into the cabin\u2019s ceiling and aisles. The plane later landed at Auckland Airport as scheduled. About 50 people were injured, according to emergency crews in Auckland. The 787 is a two-aisle plane that debuted in 2011 and is used mostly for long international flights. The version involved in the LATAM flight can carry up to about 300 passengers. United Airlines \n        UAL,\n        -1.66%,\n       with 71 Dreamliners, and American Airlines \n        AAL,\n        -2.19%,\n       with 59, are among the leading users of the plane. American said Boeing\u2019s instructions would have no impact on its operations. United declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported late Thursday that a flight attendant serving a meal in the cockpit hit a switch on the back of a seat that pushed the pilot into controls on the 787, pushing down the nose of the plane. The newspaper cited anonymous U.S. industry officials who were briefed on preliminary findings from the investigation. The newspaper said Boeing recommended that airlines check to make sure the switches are securely covered \u2014 they are not supposed to be used during flights \u2014 and told them how to turn off power to the seat motor. Chile\u2019s aviation regulator has sent investigators to New Zealand and, under international accords, will lead the investigation. It has not released any findings. The incident could ratchet up\u00a0scrutiny of Boeing, which is already at a high level since a panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max over Oregon in January. The FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Justice Department are conducting separate investigations related to the blowout and Boeing\u2019s manufacturing of Max jets. Google parent Alphabet Inc.\u2019s stock soared 12% in after-hours trading Thursday following huge spikes in revenue and net income that trounced analysts\u2019 predictions \u2014 as well as its first-ever cash dividend of 20 cents per share.

            "text": "\nBitcoin\n       neared $74,000 this past week, with crypto bulls expecting more gains despite a sharp Friday correction. One reason: a cut in Bitcoin new issuance known as a \u201chalving.\u201d A key Bitcoin feature is that tokens increase at a predictable rate. New tokens go into circulation every time Bitcoin \u201cminers\u201d win a computing race to validate a block of transactions. The reward for each block is now 6.25 Bitcoins, worth $437,500 at $70,000. That will be cut to 3.125 Bitcoins in April, when the next halving occurs. Halvings happen roughly every four years and will continue until Bitcoins in circulation hit 21 million tokens. So far, more than 19.6 million Bitcoins have been mined, leaving 1.4 million to be issued. Since Bitcoin has no underlying value\u2014only a cost to produce\u2014its price is subject to supply and demand. Halving tends to restrict supply. After the last halving in 2020, Bitcoin gained more than 80% in six months and over 500% a year later, notes crypto tax firm CoinLedger. Now, demand has been fueled by new spot Bitcoin ETFs. \u201cThe drop in the amount of mined Bitcoin a day means something has to give\u2014and, in this case, that means price has to give,\u201d says Zachary Townsend, CEO of crypto-focused insurance firm Meanwhile.  Miners are less bullish. After surging in 2023, \n        Marathon Digital\n       and \n        Riot Platforms\n       are both down 27% in the past month, with Bitcoin up more than 40%.  Bitcoin broke $73,000 only to fall back to about $69,000. Stocks struggled against sticky inflation data: The U.S. consumer price index for February came in at 0.4%, or 3.2% year over year, and producer prices were at 0.6%, over the forecast. Retail sales were soft, and tech stocks took a beating. On the week, the \n        Dow industrials\n       lost 0.02%, the \n        S&P 500\n       was off 0.13%, and the \n        Nasdaq Composite\n       shed 0.7%. The House voted to force ByteDance to divest its popular TikTok app, or be banned in the U.S. The National Association of Realtors agreed to pay $418 million in damages and abandon 6% commissions, a deal that now goes before a federal judge. \n        Boeing\u2019s\n       737 Max failed 33 of 89 regulatory audits, and the Justice Department is looking into criminal charges in the Alaska Airlines blown-door episode.

            "text": "\nBoeing\n       investors got more potential bad news about the company\u2019s troubled 737 MAX program this week: \n        United Airlines\n       is looking to lease more \n        Airbus\n       planes, according to a report.  United is seeking the Airbus A321 jet, which competes with Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX family of aircraft, Bloomberg reported Thursday. Any new A321 jets United can get its hands on would likely replace orders for 737 MAX jets. That could include replacements for the 737 MAX 10 jets United has ordered\u2014the 10 is the longest version of the MAX, but isn\u2019t certified for commercial flight yet. Boeing referred Barron\u2019s to United for a comment on a customer\u2019s fleet plans. United Airlines declined to comment. It\u2019s no surprise that United isn\u2019t exactly thrilled with Boeing. United CEO Scott Kirby has expressed frustration with MAX 10 delays, and on Tuesday, he talked about getting more A321 jets at an investor conference. Getting them directly from Airbus doesn\u2019t appear to be an option for United, however, because A321 production is booked out until the end of the decade.  \u201cWe\u2019re not going to target an artificial growth rate,\u201d Kirby said at the conference. \u201dThese [planes] are 30-year assets.\u00a0We wouldn\u2019t, for example, overpay so that we could hit next year\u2019s growth or hit 2026 growth.\u201d  United might have more success getting capacity by turning to aircraft lessors. These companies, like airlines, also order Boeing and Airbus planes. It\u2019s possible lessors have some flexibility that airlines, such as United, can take advantage of, but leasing Airbus models won\u2019t come cheap. Planes are in hot demand, with customers ordering some 2,800 single-aisle jets from Boeing and Airbus in 2023. That was the most since 2006, as far back as Barron\u2019s checked. Boeing plans to build about 38 MAX jets a month in 2024. That\u2019s in line with recent production rates, but is also a cap placed on the company by the Federal Aviation Administration in response to the 737 MAX 9 emergency door plug failure on Jan. 5. Boeing appears to be struggling to maintain that rate. United, \n        Southwest Airlines,\n       and \n        Ryanair\n       expect fewer MAX deliveries in 2024 than they did a few months ago. Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu calculates about 70 Boeing planes that airlines previously expected now won\u2019t arrive in 2024, so far. Eventually, Boeing plans to get to a production rate of 50 MAX jets a month. Airbus wants to get to 75 A320-family jets a month. Airbus has delivered A320s at a rate of almost 50 a month recently. Deliveries are the best proxy for production that investors can see easily. Both aircraft makers post monthly delivery results.  Ramping production past those levels for either company is a monthslong\u2014even yearslong\u2014process requiring coordination among hundreds of suppliers at multiple levels of the aerospace supply chain.  Boeing stock was up 0.7% in early trading at $182.58. The \n        S&P 500\n       and \n        Nasdaq Composite\n       were down 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively. Potentially losing orders isn\u2019t good news, but coming into Friday trading, Boeing shares were already down about 31% year to date.

            "text": "\nBoeing\n       continues to be battered by bad news, sending its shares lower, while stocks of aerospace suppliers look just fine. But if Boeing struggles to produce planes, won\u2019t that eventually hurt its suppliers like \n        General Electric\n      ?  The surprising answer\u2014a result of the structure of the industry and the current demand for jets\u2014is no, not really.  Through Thursday trading, Boeing shares were down about 11% over the past week and down about 31% year to date. Most, if not all, of the declines, are linked to production-quality issues uncovered after an emergency-door plug blew out during an \n        Alaska Air\n       flight of a 737 MAX 9 on Jan. 5.  The Federal Aviation Administration has capped Boeing 737 MAX production at 38 a month and will require quality improvements before letting output increase. Boeing wants to produce 50 MAX jets a month eventually.  Right now, even 38 looks like a stretch. Boeing only delivered 42 MAX jets in January and February combined, far short of a 38-per-month run rate. Boeing doesn\u2019t disclose monthly production; sales are the best proxy available.   Some production shortfalls are showing up in the airline industry. \n        Southwest Airlines\n       now anticipates receiving 46 MAX jets in 2024, down from the 79 it had told investors to expect. \n        Ryanair\n       expects roughly 20 fewer deliveries. \n        United Airlines\n       will take 70-plus MAX jets, about 20 fewer than Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu expected.  That is roughly 70 \u201cmissing planes\u201d she says.  Overall, Wall Street is expecting about 507 MAX jet deliveries in 2024. That is more than 40 a month, but Boeing is still delivering planes built during the worldwide MAX grounding that ran from March 2019 to November 2020. A production rate of 38 jets a month yields 456 for a year, leaving planes made and parked during the grounding to fill the gap.  If Boeing produces 70 jets less than the 456 it would pump out at 38 a month, that would be a 15% reduction in the number of components Boeing\u2019s suppliers could expect to sell. That wouldn\u2019t be good.  But investors can\u2019t find evidence of a mounting problem in share prices. Through Thursday trading, shares of MAX engine supplier General Electric were up more than 30% year to date. Shares of \n        Howmet Aerospace\n       were up 21%. And shares of \n        Safran\n       and \n        Parker-Hannifin\n      \u2014two more aerospace suppliers\u2014were up 26% and 16%, respectively.  Investors aren\u2019t asleep. The market, in this instance, is probably right. The suppliers will be all right.  For starters, \n        Airbus\n       is expected to deliver some 800 planes in 2024, up from 735 delivered in 2023. What is more, Boeing is projected to deliver some 140 non-MAX jets. The MAX shortfall is only 5% of all commercial jet deliveries.  Some suppliers have also been more conservative than Boeing\u2019s 38-per-month target. Howmet, for instance, based its 2024 guidance on 34 MAX jets a month.   Even if production gets even worse, Kahyaoglu said, she would still have \u201czero\u201d concerns about earnings coming from GE. She points out that GE\u2019s financial guidance is partly based on new planes replacing old planes, many of which use GE\u2019s CFM56 engines. Even if the new planes aren\u2019t made right away, the company would still get revenue from servicing the existing engines.  GE Aerospace expects to generate about $6 billion to $6.5 billion in operating profit. GE would do better, according to Kahyaoglu, if retirements of older jets slowed down because fewer MAX jets were built. The aftermarket business earns higher profit margins than the original equipment business.   GE is dividing itself into GE Aerospace and GE Vernova\u2014its power-generation businesses\u2014on April 2. A slightly better outlook for the aerospace aftermarket is one reason shares of aftermarket players \n        Heico,\nFTAI Aviation,\n       and \n        TransDigm\n       were up about 4%, 24%, and 17%, respectively.   GE didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment about how fewer planes being retired would affect its financial guidance. In any case, there is no guarantee that lower plane production would lead to less business for suppliers. Inventory is the reason.  At an investor event on March 7, GE CEO Larry Culp said that Boeing is still taking engine deliveries at the expected rate. It will need the engines eventually\u2014the planes Boeing makes are all sold and expected by customers.  Boeing\u2019s problems don\u2019t change the overall outlook for the commercial aerospace industry. Planes are in hot demand. Customers ordered some 2,800 single-aisle jets from Boeing and Airbus in 2023. That was the most since 2006, as far back as Barron\u2019s checked.  Those orders will keep production lines humming up and down the aerospace value chain for the next few years, at least.

            "text": "A switch on a pilot\u2019s seat aboard a Boeing 787 Dreamliner may have caused the flight to suddenly lose altitude, resulting in injuries to several passengers. That\u2019s according to a Thursday report in The Wall Street Journal, which cited U.S. industry officials who had been briefed on a preliminary report about the Latam flight incident that occurred on Monday.  The officials said that the flight attendant had been serving a meal in the cockpit and somehow hit a switch on the pilot\u2019s seat that pushed the pilot into those controls, ultimately leading to a brief nosedive for the plane. That switch is normally covered and not supposed to be in use when a pilot is seated. Flight LA800 bound for Santiago, Chile with 263 passengers and nine crew members departed Sydney for Auckland, New Zealand early Monday, when at some point it briefly plunged, reportedly sending some passengers flying into the air. Around 50 people were treated for mostly mild injuries when the plane landed in Auckland.  The New Zealand Herald\u00a0quoted an unnamed passenger who described the plane as briefly freezing in midair.  The probe is being led by an accident investigation commission in New Zealand. A Latam spokesman told The Wall Street Journal that the company was cooperating with officials, while Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.30%\n       said it was \u201cin contact with our customer\u2026and stands ready to support investigation-related activities as requested,\u201d in a statement.  A Boeing spokeswoman told MarketWatch in an email that the company was deferring to \u201cinvestigating agencies for any information.\u201d MarketWatch has also reached out to Latam for comment.   The report said that Boeing was due to issue a memo with regards to the seat switch to airlines using the 787 Dreamliner. Boeing has been under scrutiny since the midair blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines\u00a0\n        ALK,\n        -1.60%\n      \u00a0jet in early January.

The Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that American Airlines \n        AAL,\n        -2.05%\n       flight 345 \u201cblew a tire\u201d during takeoff from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.

The Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.30%\n       777 landed safely and taxied to the gate under its own power, American said. That model of plane has 14 tires: six on each of the two main landing-gear assemblies and two more under the nose landing gear.

            "text": "A previous version of this article gave an incorrect S&P 500 target level in the headline. The story has been corrected. \u201cThe Magnificent Seven story is over, thankfully.\u201d That was Jay Woods, the chief global strategist of Freedom Capital Markets, speaking to CNBC on Wednesday after another down day for most Big Tech names \u2014 Tesla \n        TSLA,\n        -1.18%\n       and Apple \n        AAPL,\n        +0.06%\n       were hardest hit, and the Nasdaq Composite is clinging to a roughly 0.5% monthly gain.  Concerns the tech run is getting stretched \u2014 even over \u2014 come as bitcoin scales new heights, with JPMorgan recently flagging that as a potential sign of froth in overall markets. Meanwhile, sentiment surveys from the American Association of Individual Investors cited \u201cunusually high\u201d optimism for the retail crowd. Also see: Retail traders last week rotated into Apple and Boeing, away from Nvidia But \u201crun with the bulls,\u201d says our call of the day from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s head of U.S. equity strategy, Manish Kabra, who points to a trifecta of signals suggesting stocks are some ways from overexuberance. \u201cTo cut a long story short, it\u2019s about profit inflection,\u201d Kabra said in a recent note. \u201cThe S&P 500 has clear room to overshoot despite trading at 21 times forward price/earnings as the new highs on the index coincide with new highs in the profit cycle.\u201d SocGen has penciled in 5% earnings growth in 2024 and 15% for 2025, and all of that is \u201cexposed to upside risk,\u201d the strategist says.  \u201cThe tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 is still the most important driver and source of the EPS [earnings per share] cycle. Our TMT bubble maths suggest the S&P 500 would need to reach 6,250 to tip over into irrational exuberance from current rational optimism,\u201d he says.  They found that during the 2000 boom, tech traded at 2 times its profit share in the S&P 500 \n        SPX\n       and the Nasdaq-100 is currently at 1.25 times per share. The S&P 500 itself traded at 25 times 12 months forward price/earnings during that boom versus the current 21 times.  \u201cWe say stay long U.S. tech, as the profit cycle should accelerate further in [the first half], and stay long industrials on reshoring and redistrubtion of global supply chains,\u201d said Kabra, who also said their tech AI Rise of Robots theme is a favorable investing spot.  As for his three turning-point signals, SG\u2019s Global Cycle Indicator, fed by OECD leading economic indicators, points to a \u201cboom\u201d market regime as it remains on an uptrend that began in April 2023.  \u201cThe breadth of the indicator signals that 76% of countries\u2019 leading economic indicators have improved over the past six months and 65% have improved over the past 12 months,\u201d he said.  The second signal \u2014 SocGen\u2019s Consumer Composite Indicator, driven by consumer confidence, housing and employment trends \u2014 remains positive after a turn in January, due to strong U.S. housing growth, he says. Finally, the SG Cross Asset Momentum Indicator has been positive for eight straight weeks. Beyond the EPS cycle hitting new highs, Kabresh sees U.S. stocks supported by high-yield spread compression \u2014 when yield differences between safe assets like Treasuries and high-yield corporate bonds narrow.  Calm conditions for junk bonds indicate debt investors aren\u2019t worried about company prospects, which is stock-supportive.  \u201cSubstantial room\u201d for fixed income volatility to come down is also a plus, says the strategist. \u201cThis backdrop should not lead to derating of U.S. equities beyond technical price reversals,\u201d he says. SocGen set a 4,750 target for the S&P 500 in September, which is middle of Wall Street forecasts for this year, some of which have since been bumped up.

            "text": "\nTesla\n       and \n        Boeing\n       stocks are the worst in the S&P 500 this year, and while that may feel random it actually tells a story about investing, strategy, and psychology.  Through Wednesday\u2019s trading, Tesla stock was down about 31% this year, while Boeing shares declined about 30%, making the pair the worst performers in the entire \n        S&P 500.\n       The S&P 500, overall, was up about 8% year to date.  Through a market-mathematical lens, those gains and losses make sense. Earnings drive stock prices and earnings estimates for the entire S&P 500 are up roughly 7% since late December, according to Bloomberg. Those higher earnings estimates resulted in higher equity values and the change in the index closely mirrored the change in estimates.  Earnings estimates for Boeing and Tesla aren\u2019t going up. For the EV maker, analysts have cut their 2024 and 2025 earnings estimates by 21% and 25%, respectively. Boeing\u2019s 2024 earnings estimates are down about 26% since late December. The 2025 hit hasn\u2019t been as severe though, falling about 9%.  Boeing\u2019s estimates are headed lower amid higher regulatory scrutiny and lower production after repeated quality problems which culminated in a door plug flying out of a new Boeing jet in flight. Boeing customers are likely as frustrated as the company with slower production. Demand for new aircraft is near record levels with air travel finally eclipsing prepandemic levels.  Tesla, on the other hand, isn\u2019t having quality manufacturing problems. It\u2019s facing slowing demand growth for electric vehicles amid more competition while rolling out an aging product lineup. Telsa\u2019s best-selling Model Y was introduced in 2020. On the surface, Boeing and Tesla\u2019s problems look different, but they have a similar root. Both companies are living with strategic mistakes made years ago. Shareholders are only grasping the missteps now.   In the case of Boeing, the seeds of the current problem were sown in 2011 when it announced the 737 MAX, a modified 737, in response to the growing success of the \n        Airbus\n       A320neo family of jets.  Aviation consultants and analysts still debate whether Boeing should have designed an all-new plane versus another modification of a plane in service for more than 55 years. Many wish Boeing went with the more expensive and lengthier all-new option, but it went with the latter and shareholders are paying for that decision in 2024.  In the case of Tesla, a prototype of the avant-garde Cybertruck was unveiled in 2019, giving it priority over a lower-cost vehicle. At the time, the decision seemed sound. EV pricing wasn\u2019t a concern and full-size trucks make up a large portion of new car sales in the U.S. Today, the decision doesn\u2019t look as smart. The Cybertruck is expensive and hard to build. And \n        BYD\n       has become the largest seller of all-battery electric vehicles\u2014mainly by offering lower-priced EVs, while Tesla has nothing to offer car buyers in the sub-$30,000 price category.  The market doesn\u2019t realize mistakes all at once. Boeing stock was roughly $440 a share in March 2019, years after the MAX launch and after one tragic crash of Boeing\u2019s MAX jet. Tesla stock was north of $400 a share in November 2021, two years after the Cybertruck launch and about three years after CEO Elon Musk believed Teslas would drive themselves without any supervision. Boeing closed at $182.35 Wednesday, while Tesla closed at $169.48. Market psychology is such that successful companies get a long rope. Investors are inherently optimistic. But when they stop being optimistic things go bad in what feels like the blink of an eye.  Today, both companies are in the \u2018Show me\u2019 phase of the market\u2019s psychology. No longer do Elon Musk\u2019s predictions about Tesla\u2019s future market capitalization topping that of \n        Apple\n       and Saudi Aramco combined boost his company\u2019s stock. And for Boeing, investors ignore new orders and sell stock after every potential problem. Both companies have to win back investor trust. For Boeing, that means demonstrating improved quality as production ramps higher. For Tesla, it means new, attractive vehicles developed on a schedule\u2014and new vehicles regardless of progress made on its self-driving car technology. In short, both companies need to address mistakes of the past and then wait for those decisions to bear fruit. A cheaper Tesla is due in 2025. Boeing still hasn\u2019t decided to develop a new jet.

Boeing did not comment on the phone call. There is a drawback to NTSB\u2019s focus on identifying specific workers, Homendy conceded. She worried that it could discourage people from talking about the matter with investigators, and so she told her staff to protect the identities of Boeing employees who come forward.

            "text": "Investors may have soured on Boeing Co.\u2019s stock, but not on the aerospace and defense company\u2019s bonds, which on Wednesday were seeing a wave of buying activity from Wall Street investors.  So far in 2024, Boeing\u2019s \n        BA,\n        +0.29%\n       bonds have seen about $209 million more in buying from customers than sales, according to data from BondCliQ. The buying in Boeing debt comes as spreads \u2014 the extra compensation investors earn on bonds above a risk-free benchmark \u2014 have generally increased by about 15 basis points in the past week, according to BondCliQ data.  That had Boeing\u2019s shorter-dated bonds maturing in 2027 at roughly a 5.4% yield, while those due in 2060 were closer to a 6.4% yield.  Those levels compared with a roughly 5.35% yield for the broader U.S. investment-grade corporate-bond market. Boeing has faced a slew of quality problems and snags in recent months, including the high-profile midair blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines jet in early January, which has led to heightened scrutiny from aviation authorities.   The company on Tuesday reported February deliveries that put the jet maker further behind last year\u2019s sales pace and did little to ease worries about its first-quarter sales. Southwest Airlines Co. \n        LUV,\n        -0.94%,\n      \u00a0which exclusively flies Boeing 737s, said in a filing Tuesday that Boeing has told it to expect only 46 Max jets to be delivered this year, from a previous expectation of 79 Max planes. Given the reduced expected deliveries for 2024, CreditSights analysts said they see several quarters ahead where Boeing could end up operating below its $10 billion minimum cash balance.  That potentially could trigger credit-rating downgrades, the analysts said, but still keep the company in the BBB credit-ratings bracket, or a few steps above the junk-bond category.   Boeing is in talks to buy supplier Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc.\nSPR,\n        +2.37%\n       as it seeks to improve quality controls. Spirit AeroSystems makes fuselages and other jet components for Boeing, which in 2005 sold the assets that became Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing\u2019s stock has lost 10% in the last 12 months, and 30% so far this year. That contrasts with an advance of 23% and 8%, respectively, for the S&P 500 index \n        SPX\n       over those same periods.

She criticized her predecessors for allowing a historic wave of consolidation in the aerospace industry starting in the 1980s, which left Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.28%\n       as the nation\u2019s only commercial aerospace manufacture following its 1997 merger with rival McDonnel Douglas.   Read more: Boeing vows changes after government audit finds lapses in manufacturing quality Khan said that Boeing is an example of a company that has promoted itself as a \u201dnational champion\u201d which must be shielded from antitrust enforcement because its success is important for America\u2019s success on the global stage. \u201cBoeing is the clearest example of a purposeful decision to bet on national champions on behalf of American interests,\u201d Khan said Wednesday at a speech on the future of American innovation at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.  The company is \u201dthe single best example of why a national champion strategy can be catastrophic,\u201d she added.      Khan said that Boeing\u2019s current struggles are a prime example of the harms caused by \u201cmonopolization,\u201d which lead to lower quality products, short-sighted cost cutting and overwhelming political power.  \u201cBoeing effectively became too-big-to-fail and a point of leverage for countries seeking to influence policymaking,\u201d Khan argued, noting that Congress \u201ccarved out a $25 billion line item\u201d for Boeing during the COVID crisis.   Boeing was able to forgo that money and issue bonds to raise the needed cash in 2020, though analysts say Federal Reserve support of corporate bond markets at the time was an important factor in the company\u2019s ability to raise money privately.  See also: Boeing\u2019s February deliveries slow down amid Max uncertainty Khan said the example of Boeing should be instructive as some technology companies have argued that pursuing antitrust cases against them or otherwise regulating them will \u201cweaken the American innovation and cede  the global stage to China.\u201d  On the contrary, Khan argued, it was tough antitrust enforcement against the leading tech companies of the 1970s like AT&T \n        T,\n        +1.12%\n       and Kodak \n        KODK,\n        +2.39%\n       that created openings for Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to mount the information technology revolution in the subsequent decades.  \u201cThe reality is that some of these same firms are fairly integrated into China and are seeking greater access to the Chinese markets,\u201d she said. \u201cIf America\u2019s dominant firms are not prioritizing America\u2019s national interests, what should we make of the idea that they can keep American in the lead if they\u2019re left alone?\u201d Consumer sentiment deteriorated near the end of April, according to the latest reading from the University of Michigan.

            "text": "Shares of Tesla Inc. extended their selloff toward a 10-month low Wednesday, as a Wells Fargo analyst moved to a bearish stance on the stock. With Wednesday\u2019s 3.6% move lower in afternoon trading, Tesla \n        TSLA,\n        -1.19%\n       is set to end the day below JPMorgan Chase & Co. \n        JPM,\n        +0.18%\n       in terms of market capitalization. Tesla was worth $544.9 billion based on Wednesday\u2019s intraday action, while JPMorgan was worth $551.1 billion. Tesla would be the 12th largest U.S. public company by market cap.  Despite seeming like a growth company, Tesla\u2019s business has been nearly flat in the European Union and China over the last 12 months, while its U.S. business has been down since the second quarter, Wells Fargo\u2019s Colin Langan noted in his downgrade. He cut his rating on Tesla\u2019s stock to underweight from equal weight Wednesday. Tesla shares are off 31.2% on a year-to-date basis in a downward move that\u2019s wiped out about $246.5 billion from the company\u2019s market capitalization. The electric vehicle giant\u2019s stock is now the S&P 500 index\u2019s \n        SPX\n       worst performer this year, as it surpassed the 29.9% selloff in Boeing Co.\u2019s stock \n        BA,\n        +0.26%.\n In comparison, the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF \n        DRIV\n       has slipped 1.1% this year and the S&P 500 has gained 8.5%. Even with the recent underperformance, Langan sees multiple headwinds in the company\u2019s future, including the potential for more pressure on volumes since price cuts don\u2019t seem to be as effective as they once were. Langan also wonders if the company\u2019s next big vehicle\u00a0\u2014 the Model 2 expected out in the second half of 2025\u00a0\u2014 will live up to the hype given competition in its target market and the possibility of launch delays. He cut his price target on the stock to $125 from $200, with the new target implying the potential for 28% downside from current levels.  But Tesla\u2019s stock found a defender elsewhere, as Wedbush analyst Dan Ives did his best to support the electric-vehicle giant by saying negative investor sentiment is \u201cway overdone.\u201d Ives said the current bearish narrative is similar to those seen a number of times over the years, when doubters ended up getting proven wrong after saying that Tesla\u2019s time to shine was over and EVs were just a fad. And while Ives said EV demand has clearly moderated, he expects sales and profitability to improve in the coming quarters. \u201cNow is not the time to throw in the towel on Tesla\u2026we have a high level of conviction at current levels despite the dark black clouds forming,\u201d Ives wrote in a note to clients. Wedbush\u2019s Ives reiterated his buy rating on the stock and his $315 price target, which implies about 84% upside from current levels. Ives is part of the minority on Wall Street, as only 18 of the 50 analysts surveyed by FactSet who cover Tesla are bullish. Meanwhile, 23 are neutral and the number of bears increased to nine with Langan\u2019s downgrade. Ives acknowledged that the EV price wars in China are \u201cbrutal,\u201d but he said there is a sense that many price cuts are starting to subside into the spring and summer, which is good news for both Tesla and the EV industry. He said demand is \u201csluggish\u201d for the first quarter and the \u201cnoise\u201d around Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s $56 billion compensation package is a negative overhang on the stock. However, Ives wrote, \u201cthe stock is way overshooting on the negative front as the demand story for Tesla is more in stabilization mode heading to the rest of 2024, price cuts are moderating, battery costs/production is showing strong cost efficiencies, and a Model 2 (sub $30K vehicle) is on the roadmap for the next year.\u201d  He said the stock\u2019s risk-versus-reward profile is \u201cextremely compelling\u201d at current prices. Ives envisions a valuation for Tesla exceeding $1 trillion, compared with the current market cap of $565.4 billion, as the artificial-intelligence and full-self-driving programs are making \u201cmajor strides\u201d at the company. Read: Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, other driver-assistance systems get poor ratings from auto-insurance group. Also read: Tesla\u2019s stock chart sends warning to bears that momentum may have bottomed. \u201cThe demand story for EVs globally has clearly moderated, however we believe Tesla is on the broader trajectory to see growth and margin improvement return to the story over the coming quarters,\u201d Ives wrote. Southwest Airlines Co.\u2019s stock tumbled 9% Thursday after the airline posted a wider-than-expected first-quarter loss and revenue that lagged estimates.

            "text": "\nBoeing\n       stock has been battered by legitimate quality concerns\u2014and by endless headlines re-examining the same issues while raising any incident involving a Boeing jet to a potential stock-moving event. It\u2019s overwhelming.  No one these days can win an argument about the soundness of Boeing\u2019s quality and manufacturing processes. Still, many recent reports involving Boeing jets don\u2019t qualify as unusual. The good news for investors is Boeing jets, overall, perform well in service\u2014about as well as other aircraft makers. The bad news is that doesn\u2019t mean Boeing stock will go up. That will depend on Boeing\u2019s quality improvement, evidenced by the Federal Aviation Administration loosening its grip on the airplane maker.  The FAA has capped 737 MAX production at 38 a month. Eventually, Boeing wants to produce 50 a month. Boeing has to demonstrate better quality control before it\u2019s allowed to ramp production.  Better stock performance will also require investors to become more savvy about filtering incidents involving commercial jets. That requires some context about what is normal in the aerospace business.  For starters, the Federal Aviation Administration Accident and Incident database tracked 198 U.S. incidents involving Boeing aircraft over the 10 years from 2014 to 2023 compared with 99 for \n        Airbus.\n It makes some sense that Boeing has more incidents than Airbus. U.S. airlines fly more Boeing jets. Today, about 51% of the planes in U.S.-based airline fleets are Boeing jets. Airbus jets account for about 28% of the total with \n        Embraer\n       and \n        Bombardier\n       regional jets accounting for about 14% and 7%, respectively.  The FAA data show there hasn\u2019t been much change in the number of incidents from year to year and that commercial jets in the U.S. have one or two recordable incidents every month. Anything can be an incident\u2014from a bump while taxiing to problems in flight.   The FAA database isn\u2019t a definitive list of incidents. It\u2019s only one source. The National Transportation Safety Board database has more data, including international incidents.  The NTSB database, for instance, includes the two tragic 737 MAX crashes occurring overseas in October 2018 and March 2019. Those crashes claimed 348 lives and resulted in the worldwide grounding of all MAX jets for almost two years while Boeing worked to fix faulty flight control software. The NTSB database also includes the tragic 2014 Malaysia Airlines flight that was shot down by Russian forces over Ukraine.  NTSB data show commercial airliners around the world have about three reportable incidents a month. Over the past decade, that data works out to one incident\u2014of any kind\u2014every 200,000 flights. The International Civil Aviation Organization, another source on aviation safety, reports the global aviation industry reports about two accidents per million flights. That\u2019s down from about three a decade ago.  The difference between incidents and accidents boils down to what data each organization collects. The 2023 ICAO report listed 64 accidents occurring in 2022. The NTSB database tracked 165 incidents tied to major aircraft makers that year.  Many of the incidents the NTSB collects have nothing to do with aircraft maintenance or design. Many involve older aircraft. The wheel that fell off a \n        United Airlines\n       Boeing 777 jet on Mar 7 was 22 years old. That plane had gone through several maintenance checks and inspections over its life.   Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard worries about overreactions when coverage of accidents ramps up without context. \u201cWhat I think is relevant is the FAA stuff,\u201d he says.  Investors shouldn\u2019t react, as much, to reports of wheels falling off an older plane or 787 turbulence that injured 50 on a LATAM flight. They should pay closer attention to things like the Mar. 11 airworthiness directive which instructs airlines to inspect 737 MAX \u201cspoiler wire bundles that led to unintended spoiler motion.\u201d The spoilers are on the wings and disrupt airflow. Boeing didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment about the airworthiness directive.  Stallard rates shares Hold and has a $230 price target for Boeing stock. \u201cThere seemed to be a buyer for Boeing at $200, but even he has given up,\u201d he adds. Stallard believes shares could fall to $180 as the FAA will continue to contain Boeing\u2019s production while it waits for quality metrics to improve.  Boeing stock closed at $184.24 on Tuesday, down 4.3%, after the New York Times provided additional details about a six-week audit conducted by the FAA. The FAA had already reported on Mar. 4 it found \u201cmultiple instances\u201d of quality control problems. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker reviewed some audit findings in a\u00a0Monday news briefing, saying his agency found issues with paperwork, tool management, and the order work was being done, among other things. \u201cThe area between $170 and $176 would be the next stop,\u201d says CappThesis founder and market technician Frank Cappelleri, adding \u201c$176 was the October 2023 low.\u201d  Cappelleri isn\u2019t making a fundamental call on the stock. He is looking at stock charts to get a sense of when Stallard\u2019s \u201cbuyer\u201d might get interested again.  Additional declines aren\u2019t what investors want to hear about. The good news, amid a lot of troubling news, is that traveling by plane is still getting safer over time.  That might not be much comfort to Boeing shareholders who have watched the stock fall almost 60% from record highs set in March 2019, while the \n        S&P 500\n       is up about 80% over the same span. Still, understanding the safety data can help shareholders understand what new issues that arise matter for their investment.

            "text": "The uproar in Congress over popular Chinese-owned social-media platform TikTok represents a steady evolution of tension between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. It won\u2019t be the last chapter. On a day when the House of Representatives votes on a bill seeking to ban TikTok in the U.S., or at least force it to sever ties with its Chinese parent ByteDance, the issue underscores the value of big data\u2014not just for marketing, but for national security. The concern among lawmakers is that TikTok may be able to give the data harvested from its millions of users to someone else\u2014the Chinese government, for example. That information could then be used for nefarious purposes\u2014for example spying or extortion. TikTok denies that it is an agent of the Chinese state or any other, and says it poses no greater risk to the U.S. than YouTube or Instagram, owned by \n        Alphabet\n       and \n        Meta Platforms\n       respectively\u2014two American companies. Still, it isn\u2019t a crazy idea. Anyone who\u2019s seen an advertisement pop up on their phone for a product they might have casually talked about with friends understands how intrusive modern-day technology can be.  To be fair, an app as widespread as TikTok might have become a worry for U.S. officials even if it were owned by a close ally such as the U.K. or Japan. But the reason it\u2019s a problem now is because of the emerging economic rivalry with China. It\u2019s a natural extension of then-president Donald Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs in 2018. That quickly moved on to semiconductors and telecoms equipment. The next flashpoint could be any area where there\u2019s a gap between the two countries and room for one of them to play catch-up. Electric vehicles, as exemplified by the growing competition between \n        Tesla\n       and \n        BYD,\n       come to mind. So do pharmaceuticals, or renewable energy. When the next front of the trade wars opens there\u2019s certain to be opportunities for savvy investors. \u2014Brian Swint Lawmakers are set to vote today on a bipartisan bill that would force China\u2019s ByteDance to shed its ownership of the popular video-sharing app TikTok within months or risk being blocked on U.S. app stores, something TikTok says amounts to a ban of the social-media app.  What\u2019s Next: The bill needs two-thirds approval in the House to pass. It faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where Democrats hold a slim majority, but President Joe Biden has said he would sign it. \u2014Liz Moyer The Biden administration plans to send up to $300 million worth of weapons to Ukraine, including air defense interceptors, artillery rounds, and armor systems. The funds are coming from money the government saved from contracts that came in under bid, but national security adviser Jake Sullivan says it won\u2019t last long. What\u2019s Next: Sullivan told reporters at a White House briefing that the funding announced Tuesday isn\u2019t a replacement for the foreign aid package, urging Congress to pass one as soon as possible. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also encouraged the speaker to allow a vote. \u2014Janet H. Cho Dividend payments from U.S. firms rose 5.1% in 2023 to a record $602.1 billion, according to research from money management firm Janus Henderson Global. And it wasn\u2019t just in America\u2014boosting dividends was a global phenomenon with worldwide payouts rising 5% to an all-time high of $1.66 trillion. What\u2019s Next: So what lies ahead for 2024? Probably even more dividend increases. Janus Henderson said it expects another 5% jump in global payouts, to a fresh record of $1.72 trillion this year. \u201cStrong dividend growth in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2023 coupled with healthy corporate balance sheets bode well for future dividend growth,\u201d said Amber Milam, client portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, in the report. \u2014Paul R. La Monica Airlines are reducing their schedules and paring back hiring plans after \n        Boeing\n       said it would deliver fewer planes than it expected this year. Boeing said it shipped 17 narrow-body MAX jets in February, eight fewer than in January, and half as many deliveries as in November and December. What\u2019s Next: Boeing, which said production would fall below its 38 planes-a-month target in the first half of this year, has unveiled new measures to improve quality, including compliance checks and quality audits at its factory, and an end to performing manufacturing steps out of sequence. \u2014Janet H. Cho, Al Root, and Angela Palumbo \nNew York Community Bancorp\n       said it is planning a 1-for-3 reverse stock split after completing a deal that gave the regional lender a $1.05 billion capital infusion from an investor group led by former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s private-equity firm. The investor group will hold 39.6% of the company. What\u2019s Next: NYCB is expected to make an amended annual filing later this week as an update to the material weakness disclosure, including its plan for remediating the weaknesses. \u2014Emily Dattilo and Janet H. Cho Dear Quentin, I am requesting advice on behalf of my 24-year-old daughter. She asked me if she should speak up about receiving a smaller raise than a man who is basically the male version of her. Here is the backstory: She is an engineer, and one of the few women at the company in that position. She said the company has difficulty holding onto female engineers, and the women who have left have all cited sexism as a main reason for leaving, and the older women still there have given her numerous examples as cautionary tales.  She found out that a man in her shoes (same degree, same year-end evaluation rating) received a higher raise than she did. She is rather peeved about it, because she was stronger academically than him, so she feels if anything, her raise should be higher, not the other way around. They both have the same degree and graduated at the same time, and they both received the same rating/classification in the year-end review.  She said the man tried to explain it away as there being other factors, such as project funding, that go into raises, but it isn\u2019t sitting right with her.  \u2014The Mother Read the Moneyist\u2019s response here. \u2014Quentin Fottrell \u2014Newsletter edited by Liz Moyer, Patrick O\u2019Donnell, Rupert Steiner Oversold rally earlier this week doesn\u2019t erase the U.S.  market\u2019s negative picture.

            "text": "By Ed Frankl The U.K. economy returned to growth in January, after contracting in the second half of last year, as rising real wages boosted spending by British shoppers. Britain's economy was weaker than most of its peers last year, and was the only member of the Group of Seven large rich countries to see a contraction in both of the final two quarters. A sustained return to growth would add to signs that global growth is becoming more broadly spread, after being largely driven by the U.S. last year. Gross domestic product in the U.K. rose by 0.2% compared with December, according to figures published Wednesday by the Office for National Statistics, marginally more than the 0.1% expected by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. In December, the economy contracted by 0.1%. \"Big picture: the economy is starting to turn a corner,\" said Sanjay Raja, Deutsche Bank's chief U.K. economist. As elsewhere in Europe, British consumers were hit hard by the surge in energy and food prices that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But wages are now rising more rapidly than consumer prices, restoring some of that lost spending power. ONS figures released Tuesday showed that real wages--which adjusts pay rises for inflation--were 1.8% higher in the three months through January than a year earlier. Some households have also benefited from tax cuts announced in November, with more to come from next month. However, the economy remains in a weak state. The ONS said GDP in the period from November through January was 0.1% lower than in the three months through October. The Bank of England expects to see growth of just 0.25% this year, although many economists think that is too pessimistic. The government's budget watchdog last week forecast the economy would grow by 0.8%. With growth set to remain modest, investors continue to expect that the BOE will lower its key interest rate this year. \"Despite a positive start to the year, the U.K. economy remains in a relatively fragile position,\" said Roger Barker, director of policy at the Institute of Directors, a lobby group for businesses. \"The case for an early cut in interest rates by the Bank of England is still a strong one.\" While the annual rate of inflation has fallen sharply over recent months, and might reach the central bank's 2% target as early as April, policy makers worry that the still rapid pace of wage rises will keep prices for services rising faster than their target for many months to come.

            "text": "Responding to a U.S. government audit,\u00a0Boeing\u00a0said Tuesday that it would work with employees found to have violated company manufacturing procedures to make sure they understand instructions for their jobs. The aircraft maker detailed its latest steps to correct lapses in quality in a memo to employees from Stan Deal, president of Boeing\u2019s commercial plane division. The memo went out after the Federal Aviation Administration finished a six-week review of the company\u2019s manufacturing processes for the 737 Max jetliner after a\u00a0panel blew off\u00a0one of the planes during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. The FAA reviewed 89 aspects of production at Boeing\u2019s \n        BA,\n        +0.20%\n       plant in Renton, Wash., and found the company failed 33 of them, according to a person familiar with the report.

            "text": "\nBoeing\n       stock was falling again Tuesday after details emerged regarding the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s six-week audit of the aerospace company. Analysts are weighing in regarding its problems. A review of the findings of the audit, conducted after the midair blowout of an emergency-door plug on a Boeing 737 MAX 9 jet on Jan. 5, was published by the New York Times on Monday. Boeing failed 33 of 89 so-called product audits conducted by the FAA, the newspaper said.  Investors knew the audit didn\u2019t paint Boeing in a positive light. A Mar. 4 FAA news release noted \u201cmultiple instances\u201d of quality control problems. And FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker reviewed some audit findings in a Monday news briefing, saying his agency found issues with paperwork, tool management, and the order work was being done, among other things.  The FAA didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about the New York Times report. Boeing said, \u201cBased on the\u00a0FAA\u00a0audit, our quality [meetings], and the recent expert panel report, we continue to implement immediate changes and develop a comprehensive action plan to strengthen safety and quality and build the confidence of our customers and their passengers.\u201d  The company also outlined steps taken since the audits including inspections of employee toolboxes, adding training, and implementing additional layers of inspections and compliance checks, among other things.   \u201cIt all adds up to a pretty big problem,\u201d said AeroDynamic Advisory managing director Richard Aboulafia. \u201cThe company\u2019s position, in terms of market share, reputation, and relations with regulators is getting worse.\u201d  The mounting problems continue to weigh on Boeing stock, which dropped 4.3% in Tuesday trading to $184.24. They fell 3% on Monday following a report by The Wall Street Journal that the Justice Department had opened a criminal probe into the Jan. 5 incident. Boeing declined to comment on the report.  The \n        S&P 500\n       and \n        Dow Jones Industrial Average\n       closed up 1.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Coming into Tuesday\u2019s trading, Boeing stock was down about 26% this year.  The issues for investors didn\u2019t stop at the FAA audit on Tuesday. Separately, \n        Southwest Airlines\n       said that it expects to receive 46 Boeing MAX 8 jets in 2024, down from the 58 it had anticipated. The airline said it no longer expects any of the shorter MAX 7 jets it had ordered to be delivered in 2024. The MAX 7 hasn\u2019t been certified by aviation regulators yet.  \u201cPressure mounting,\u201d wrote Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu in a Tuesday report, citing all the recent news and adding that Boeing recently sent a letter to Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell\u2014chair of the Senate committee, Science and Transportation\u2014saying it couldn\u2019t find documentation on work performed on the door plug that blew out. Boeing didn\u2019t immediately comment on its correspondence with the senator.   \u201cAviation Week\u2026notes that the FAA published a notification yesterday that requires 737 operators to check specific wire bundles on their planes,\u201d added Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard in a Tuesday report.  Kahyaoglu rates shares Buy and has a $300 price target for the stock. Stallard rates shares Hold and has a $230 price target.  Overall, 69% of analysts covering the company rate shares Buy, according to FactSet. The average Buy-rating ratio for shares in the S&P 500 is about 55%. The average analyst target price for Boeing stock is about $267 a share.

            "text": "Stocks rose on Tuesday as investors shrugged off U.S. inflation that rose more than expected in February. These stocks made moves Tuesday: \nOracle\n       reported fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.41 a share as revenue rose 7% to $13.28 billion. Analysts had been expecting the enterprise software company to post a profit in the period of $1.38 a share on revenue of $13.3 billion. The company\u2019s cloud infrastructure business rose 49% to $1.8 billion. CEO Safra Catz said large new cloud infrastructure contracts signed during the quarter \u201cdrove \n        Oracle\u2019s\n       total remaining performance obligations up 29% to over $80 billion\u2014an all-time record.\u201d Oracle said it expects cloud revenue to rise as much as 24% in the fourth quarter. Oracle shares jumped 12%. \nNvidia\n       rose 7.2%. The strong market for the company\u2019s graphics-processing units\u00a0was emphasized\u00a0in Oracle\u2019s\u00a0earnings report. Oracle recently signed a new cloud-computing infrastructure deal with \n        Nvidia\n       and said it plans to boost capital spending in the next fiscal year, suggesting\u00a0sustained demand\u00a0for AI chips. \nSouthwest Airlines\n       sank 15% after the carrier said it expects revenue per available seat mile in the first quarter at flat to up 2% from a year earlier, compared with previous expectations for growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. Southwest cited soft leisure travel trends. The company also said it was re-evaluating fiscal-year guidance because of lower expected deliveries of \n        Boeing\n       aircraft. \n        Boeing\n       was down 4.3% as details emerged regarding the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s six-week audit of the aerospace giant. \nAmerican Airlines\n       fell 4.7% after saying it expects an adjusted loss in the first quarter at the \u201clow end\u201d of its previous estimate for a loss of 15 cents to 35 cents a share because of higher fuel prices. Analysts had been expecting a loss of 22 cents.  \n3M\n       rose 5% after announcing that William Brown, the former chief executive of defense giant\u00a0\n        L3Harris Technologies,\n       will succeed the industrial company\u2019s current CEO Michael Roman on May 1. Roman will continue as executive chairman of 3M\u2019s board.  \nAcadia Pharmaceuticals\n       fell 17% after the company\u2019s drug pimavanserin for the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia didn\u2019t demonstrate a statistically significant improvement over a placebo. \u201cWe will continue to analyze these data with our scientific advisors, but we do not intend to conduct any further clinical trials with pimavanserin,\u201d said Acadia CEO Steve Davis. Shares of \n        Archer Daniels Midland\n       rose 4% after the agricultural company said it expects fiscal-year adjusted earnings of $5.25 to $6.25 a share versus analysts\u2019 estimates of $5.41, and its board authorized an additional $2 billion to its share buyback program. The company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings missed forecasts. \nOn Holding\n       fell 8.9% after the Swiss footwear and apparel maker issued a sales forecast for the fiscal year that missed Wall Street estimates. The company said it expects sales of $2.57 billion, below analysts\u2019 expectations of $2.64 billion. On Holding said \u201cnegative foreign exchange impacts are expected to be more pronounced\u201d in the first half of the year. \nAsana,\n       the work management software company, reported a fiscal fourth-quarter loss of 4 cents a share, narrower than analysts\u2019 expectations. \n        Asana\n       said it expects an adjusted loss in the first quarter of 8 cents to 9 cents a share, in line with estimates, and revenue of $168 million to $169 million, up 10% to 11% from a year earlier. The stock fell 13%. \nNew York Community Bancorp\n       rose 5.9% after the regional lender said it was planning a reverse stock split after completing a deal that provided it with a $1.05 billion\u00a0capital infusion\u00a0from an investor group led by former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. \nKohl\u2019s\n       reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts\u2019 estimates but sales that missed. The shares fell 6.7%. The department-store company also announced a partnership with Babies \u201cR\u201d Us.  \nAdvance Auto Parts\n      \u00a0said it appointed three new directors to its board and reached cooperation agreements with activist investors Third Point and Saddle Point Management. Third Point has a stake in the auto parts retailer, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Dan Loeb\u2019s Third Point approached \n        Advance Auto Parts\n       earlier this year with the primary goal of adding directors with experience in the industry to its board, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. The stock was up 3.6%. It has declined 36% over the past 12 months.

            "text": "Airfares jumped 3.6% in February, the largest monthly rise since May 2022, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. While higher costs for labor and maintenance appear to be responsible, \n        Boeing\u2019s\n       latest troubles could help keep prices high for the rest of the year.  The latest gains continue a surge that began last summer, after a calmer spell that gave travelers a respite from the higher fares they paid in 2021 and 2022 as a result of postpandemic travel demand and higher costs for fuel. By February, airfares had gained 9% over the past seven months.  One element behind that is strikes by pilots and flight attendants that won higher wages and better benefits for airplane crews. Airlines are also facing an uptick in maintenance costs as higher flight volumes and longer hours in the air require more engine overhauls and extensive checks of the aircrafts, the companies have said. In 2023, the cost of maintenance and repair at \n        United Airlines Holdings\n       increased 27% from the previous year, while salaries and benefits for staff went up by 29%, lifting total operating expenses by 16%. Maintenance and salary costs grew by double digits at other major airlines as well. Higher operating costs mean that airlines have to either accept lower margins or raise ticket prices. Many airlines have increased baggage fees in recent weeks to boost revenue.\u00a0 While demand for travel is growing strongly\u2014the Airports Council International has forecast that global passenger traffic would increase 12% in 2024 to surpass the 2019 level for the first time\u2014putting more planes in the air to carry the extra passengers is likely to be harder than usual.  \nBoeing\u2019s\n       recent safety crisis has led to disruptions in its schedule of plane deliveries. Regulators are investigating the aerospace company\u2019s safety standards and production process in response to a January mid-flight incident in which an emergency-door plug blew out of a 737 MAX 9 jet.\u00a0The plane landed with a gaping hole in its fuselage. The ensuing probe into Boeing\u2019s safety standards and production process could leave airlines with fewer airplanes than expected this summer at the busiest time of the year. Multiple carriers have warned recently that their plans to increase capacity could be hurt by delivery delays from Boeing.\u00a0 During its Tuesday earnings call, \n        Southwest Airlines\n       management said Boeing expects to deliver 12 fewer MAX 8 aircraft than the previously expected 58. To adjust to the changes, the firm could delay planned plane retirements, which would likely lead to higher maintenance costs, or reduce its flight capacity. Southwest is leaning towards the latter. Management said the firm expects 2024 capacity to grow between 4.5% and 5% after a cut of 1 to 1.5 percentage points from the impact of the Boeing delays. But the impact would be primarily focused on post-peak summer schedules, the company said.

            "text": "\nSouthwest Airlines\n       is getting fewer aircraft this year than it previously expected as issues at \n        Boeing\n       intensify. \nSouthwest,\n       which strictly uses Boeing jets, said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday that Boeing told the airline to expect 46 deliveries of the 737-8 plane in 2024, less than the previously expected 79. \u201cAs a result of Boeing\u2019s continued challenges, the Company expects the delivery schedule to be fluid and, therefore, plans to reduce capacity and re-optimize schedules, primarily for the back half of 2024, which will likely result in at least a one point reduction to the Company\u2019s full year 2024 capacity plans on a year-over-year basis,\u201d Southwest said in the filing. Shares of Southwest were falling 15% to $28.85 and were on pace for their largest percentage decrease since March 12, 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The stock was the worst performer in the \n        S&P 500\n       Tuesday, while the index gained 0.7%. Boeing stock has dropped 29% so far this year, as the aircraft maker has had a challenging couple of months. An Alaska Air Group flight had to conduct in emergency landing in January after an emergency-door plug blew out on a 737 MAX 9. This led to the temporary grounding of the aircrafts. Then on March 4, the Federal Aviation Administration said it had found multiple instances where Boeing allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements. The U.S. Justice Department is also opening a criminal investigation into the Alaska Air flight that resulted in the emergency landing, The Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported on Saturday. Southwest\u2019s announcement on Tuesday comes as airlines get ready for the J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference later in the day. In preparation for the conference, Alaska Air said in a regulatory filing that as a result of the door incident and the grounding, \u201cour profitability was negatively impacted by at least $150 million.\u201d Alaska Air said it has \u201creceived partial compensation from Boeing,\u201d which will be accounted for in first-quarter earnings. \u201cOur adjusted loss-per-share expectation reflects this compensation, and approximately ($0.30) remaining impact from the grounding.\u201d Also, Alaska Air said it has returned its fleet \u201csafely to service and restored our schedule,\u201d and first-quarter performance is on track to exceed previous expectations. \nAmerican Airlines Group\n       updated its first-quarter financial estimates without mentioning Boeing in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. The airline now expects its first-quarter adjusted loss per share to be at the low end of previous guidance for a loss of 15 cents to 35 cents, as fuel prices \u201cincreased considerably.\u201d American Airlines stock was down 4.4% Tuesday while shares of Alaska Air Group were up 1%.

Barnett\u2019s attorney, Brian Knowles,\u00a0was quoted as having told TMZ that he had doubts\u00a0about the circumstances of Knowles\u2019s death, calling the self-inflicted gunshot \u201calleged.\u201d \u201cToday is a tragic day,\u201d Knowles reportedly told\u00a0Corporate Crime Reporter.\u00a0\u201cJohn had been back and forth for quite some time getting prepared.

Knowles and his co-counsel had been calling Barnett\u2019s phone on Saturday, but the calls went to voicemail, according to Knowles. \u201cWe then asked the hotel to check on him,\u201d he said. \u201cThey found him in his truck dead from an alleged self-inflicted gunshot.

In 2019, Barnett told the BBC that Boeing had compromised safety by rushing to get its 787 Dreamliner off the production line, alleging that up to a quarter of onboard oxygen systems could be faulty and not functional if needed. Boeing released a statement on Barnett\u2019s death. \u201cWe are saddened by Mr. Barnett\u2019s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends,\u201d the statement read.

            "text": "By Stuart Condie and Ben Otto SYDNEY--Air New Zealand will pause one of the world's longest non-stop flights for up to six months due to what the carrier said is a shortage of engines for its Boeing Dreamliner aircraft. New Zealand's national carrier on Tuesday said it would pause its non-stop Auckland-Chicago service from March 31. It cited challenges related to the availability of serviceable Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. \"Rolls-Royce has been unable to provide Air New Zealand with spare or replacement engines to deliver the level of service needed, leading to a reduction in the amount of flying Air New Zealand can deliver via its 787 fleet,\" it said. The airline said the Trent 1000 engines normally require being removed from aircraft and sent to the manufacturer for inspection after 1,000 engine cycles of take-offs and landings, but that Air New Zealand engineers had determined maintenance was required after 750-850 cycles. The airline added that while up to three aircraft will be \"unavailable for an extended period,\" it will maintain its schedule of up to 35 flights weekly to six ports across the U.S. and Canada. The carrier's fleet comprised 105 aircraft at the end of October, including 14 Boeing 787 jets. Air New Zealand began offering three non-stop Auckland-Chicago flights weekly in late 2018. The route takes about 15-16 hours, making it one of the world's longest non-stop flights. The airline said the decision to pause the service wasn't likely to affect the fiscal 2024 guidance it issued in February. Air New Zealand said last month it expects annual pretax earnings of between 200 million New Zealand dollars (US$123.4 million) and NZ$240 million. Last month, Rolls-Royce Chief Executive Tufan Erginbilgic said the wait times for Trent 1000 engines had doubled. He said Rolls-Royce expects Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to certify a new blade this year, which should improve the engine's durability. The engine manufacturer has also been affected by supply chain issues, he said on a call with investors. \"Across the industry in aerospace, there are bottlenecks caused by both labor and parts shortages,\" Erginbilgic said. Air New Zealand is already grappling with an engine shortage from a global recall of hundreds of Pratt & Whitney jet engines. Last month, the carrier said it anticipates NZ$35 million of fiscal second-half costs due to the recall, which forced it to revise flight schedules and lease aircraft.

            "text": "By Ed Frankl U.K. wage growth eased marginally, as the unemployment rate ticked up, a small relief to Bank of England policymakers hoping that labor pressures would ease ahead of expected interest-rate cuts later this year. The headline measure of average annual pay growth, excluding bonuses, was 6.1% in the three months to January, compared with 6.2% in the final quarter of 2023, a fifth fall in as many months, according to data published Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics. The rate was the lowest since October 2022. Meanwhile, the rate of joblessness grew to 3.9% between November and January, a little higher than the 3.8% in the three months to December, it said. It compares with expectations that wage growth and unemployment would hold steady at 6.2% and 3.8% respectively, according to economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. Including bonuses, annual wage growth eased to 5.6% in November-January, from 5.8% in the three months to December, the ONS said. \"Recent trends in the jobs market are continuing with earnings, in cash terms, growing more slowly than recently but, thanks to lower inflation, real terms pay continues to increase,\" the ONS's director of economic statistics Liz McKeown, said. The U.K.'s annual inflation was 4.0% in January, the same as December. Falling wage growth could mean the BOE would be more comfortable with lowering interest rates, though wage pressures remain high and unemployment is near its historic low. Indeed, despite encouraging signs of a more marked slowdown, the ease in wage growth in January is probably still a bit too slow for the Bank of England's liking, Paul Dales, Chief U.K. economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. A rise in the minimum wage at the start of April could also put further pressure on wages. The central bank meets next on March 21. However, a further fall in job vacancies--to 908,000 in the three months to February from 928,000 in the three months to January--suggests the labor market continues to loosen, Dales added. If wage growth continues to cool, and inflation falls below the BOE's 2.0% target in April, that could be enough to prompt the bank to cut rates in the summer, he said.

The headline measure of average pay growth, excluding bonuses, was 6.1% in the three months to January, compared with 6.2% in the final quarter of 2023, according to data published Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics. Meanwhile, the rate of joblessness grew to 3.9% between November and January, a little higher than the 3.8% in the three months to December, it said. It compares with expectations that wage growth and unemployment would hold steady, according to economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. Falling wage growth could mean the BOE would be more comfortable with lowering interest rates, though wage pressures remain high and unemployment is near its historic low. A rise in the minimum wage at the start of April could further put pressure on wages. The central bank meets later in March. Write to Ed Frankl at edward.frankl@wsj.com So far this year, the PHLX Semiconductor Index has increased 8.7% (with dividends reinvested), but it has declined 7.7% in April.

            "text": "Oracle Corp. has reached an important milestone in its decade-long shift to becoming a cloud-computing company \u2014 revenue from the cloud surpassed its traditional software licensing revenue for the first time. Oracle Chief Executive Safra Catz touted that fact on the company\u2019s conference call with analysts Monday while discussing its better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings. Oracle shares \n        ORCL,\n        +2.05%\n       jumped 14% in after-hours trading, ending the session at $130.50. The company\u2019s total cloud revenue jumped 24% in the quarter, while its software-licensing revenue was down 3%. Executives talked about continued strong demand for its cloud services, and how Oracle is building more data centers to keep up with demand, which is also being fueled by the need for more generative-AI infrastructure. \u201cWe have enormous amounts of demand,\u201d Catz said, adding that there are many new customers that have not reached their capacity yet. When asked about her projections to nearly double capital spending to $10 billion in fiscal 2025, she said it was necessary to build out more data centers and expand existing ones.   Oracle co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison described one massive data center in Salt Lake City currently under construction. \u201dYou can park eight Boeing 747s nose-to-tail in that one data center,\u201d he said.  The company is also getting a lot of interest from governments seeking to create so-called sovereign clouds, a cloud infrastructure designed exclusively for the security needs of government entities and their institutions.\u00a0 However, even while projecting a 22% to 24% increase in total cloud revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter,  Catz also guided non-GAAP earnings to a range of down 2% to flattish, between $1.62 and $1.66 share. She noted that as the company\u2019s cloud capacity fills up, margins will rise. Oracle may also be seeing an impact from its big spending and focus on low prices for cloud services. Also read: Oracle was late in the cloud but now its stock could win big. With its massive data-center buildout and crossover in revenue, Oracle can now truly call itself a major player in the cloud. But how sustainable that demand is remains the big question, as many investors  try to find companies besides the obvious chip makers \u2014 like Nvidia Corp. \n        NVDA,\n        +5.98%\n       \u2014 that will benefit from AI.   Southwest Airlines Co.\u2019s stock tumbled 9% Thursday after the airline posted a wider-than-expected first-quarter loss and revenue that lagged estimates.

            "text": "With Boeing facing multiple government investigations, the company needs to make \u201ca serious transformation\u201d around its safety and manufacturing quality, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Monday. The comments came one day after Buttigieg said the aircraft builder is under \u201cenormous\u201d scrutiny by his department since a panel blew off a Boeing 737 Max jetliner in midlfight. Over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Department of Justice\u00a0launched a criminal investigation\u00a0into the\u00a0Jan. 5 blowout\u00a0on an Alaska Airlines jet. That followed the company\u2019s admission that it couldn\u2019t find records that the National Transportation Safety Board sought for work done on the panel at a Boeing factory. The Federal Aviation Administration, part of Buttigieg\u2019s department, is\u00a0also investigating\u00a0Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.26%.\n \u201cObviously we respect the independence of DOJ (the Department of Justice) and NTSB (the National Transportation Safety Board) doing their own work,\u201d Buttigieg told reporters Monday, \u201cbut we are not neutral on the question of whether Boeing should fully cooperate with any entity \u2014 NTSB, us, or DOJ. They should, and we expect them to.\u201d Buttigieg said Boeing must \u201cgo through a serious transformation here in terms of their responsiveness, their culture and their quality issues.\u201d Boeing gave a one-sentence response. \u201cWe will continue to cooperate fully and transparently with all government investigations and audits, as we take comprehensive action to improve safety and quality at Boeing,\u201d the company said. Alaska Airlines \n        ALK,\n        -1.09%\n       said it is cooperating with the Justice Department investigation. \u201cIn an event like this, it\u2019s normal for the DOJ to be conducting an investigation,\u201d the Seattle-based airline said in a statement. \u201cWe are fully cooperating and do not believe we are a target of the investigation.\u201d Last week, Boeing, which is based in Arlington, Virginia, came under\u00a0withering criticism\u00a0by NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy over the missing work records on the Alaska jet. She told a Senate committee that Boeing had repeatedly rebuffed her agency\u2019s attempts to get information ever since the blowout. Boeing disputed some of Homendy\u2019s claims; NTSB stood by her testimony. The FAA has barred Boeing from boosting production of Max jets and gave the company 90 days to come up with a plan to fix\u00a0quality-control issues. A surprisingly high inflation reading in the first quarter has raised anxiety about whether a key price index in March could be worse than expected and could lower the odds of U.S. interest-rate cuts.

New Zealand's national carrier on Tuesday said that it would pause the service from March 31. It cited challenges related to the availability of serviceable Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. The airline said the decision was not likely to affect the fiscal 2024 guidance it issued in February. Air New Zealand said last month it expects annual earnings of 200 million New Zealand dollars (US$123.4 million) and NZ$240 million. Last month, Rolls-Royce Chief Executive Tufan Erginbilgic said that wait times for Trent 1000 engines had doubled. He said that Rolls-Royce expects Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to certify a new blade this year, which should improve the engine's durability. The engine manufacturer has also been affected by supply chain issues, he said on a call with investors. \"Across the industry in aerospace, there are bottlenecks caused by both labor and parts shortages,\" Erginbilgic said. Air New Zealand is already grappling with an engine shortage from a global recall of hundreds of Pratt & Whitney jet engines. Last month, the carrier said it anticipates NZ$35 million of fiscal second-half costs due to the recall, which forced it revise flight schedules and lease aircraft.

The company was sued Friday over allegedly using copyrighted works in training artificial-intelligence systems.  \nBoeing\n       fell 3% after The Wall Street Journal reported the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into the \n        Boeing\n       737 MAX jet that experienced a blowout on an Alaska Airlines flight in early January. The Journal, citing documents and people familiar with the matter, said investigators have contacted some passengers and crew on the Jan. 5 flight. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all MAX 9 jets after the incident. They returned to service\u00a0after all required repairs were made and the planes were inspected. \nCoinbase\n       fell 1% and \n        MicroStrategy\n      \u00a0rose 4.1% as the crypto-related companies reacted to \n        Bitcoin\u2019s\n       moves.

            "text": "It has been a rough couple of years for investors in China, but the world\u2019s second largest economy has begun to show signs of resurgence.  The MSCI China index \n        MCHI\n       has outperformed the S&P 500 \n        SPX\n       over the past month as valuations in the U.S. have sparked a debate over whether we\u2019re seeing the formation of an equity bubble, leading some analysts to argue that investors should take a another look at leading Chinese companies as an inexpensive alternative to those in the U.S. \n\u201c\u2018[W]hen Trump gets involved, his view can swiftly change votes and support on Capitol Hill with the Republican conference.\u2019\u201d\n The threat of a new China trade war looms over these arguments, as polling shows Donald Trump with a slight edge in the race with incumbent Joe Biden to win the White House in November. Yet China market experts say that a second Trump trade war may grab headlines but won\u2019t substantively affect the performance of the country\u2019s top companies.  Context: Biden says he\u2019ll sign proposed bill banning TikTok if Congress passes it. Trump is suddenly an opponent. A case in point is the former president\u2019s sudden reversal on the effort to force Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. to sell TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. ByteDance isn\u2019t publicly traded, but Trump\u2019s positions on the company could signal his attitudes toward China policy more broadly.  Trump said his reason for flip flopping on a proposed measure he supported when in office is that it would benefit Facebook \n        META,\n        +0.47%,\n       an entity he characterized as \u201can enemy of the people\u201d in a Monday interview with CNBC.   Critics from across the political spectrum, including former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, have pointed out that Trump\u2019s change of heart came shortly after a meeting with billionaire ByteDance investor and conservative donor Jeff Yass. Trump said he has never discussed TikTok with Yass.    The House of Representatives has scheduled a vote on the legislation  Tuesday after the bill was voted out of committee on a bipartisan, 50-0 vote.  \u201cIn our view, this bill has all the makings of something that could pass the House and Senate and be signed by the White House swiftly, but, in a twist that shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise anymore, Trump has decided to step into the fray and has\u00a0encouraged opposition to the bill,\u201d wrote Henrietta Treyz, director of economic-policy research at Veda Partners, in a Sunday client note.  \u201cAbsent Trump\u2019s involvement in the situation we would put 75% odds on this bill becoming law, but \u2026 when Trump gets involved, his view can swiftly change votes and support on Capitol Hill with the Republican conference,\u201d she added.  While there are many reasons to be skeptical about the Chinese economy more broadly, experts surveyed by MarketWatch argued that the sort of bilateral tariffs imposed by Trump on China aren\u2019t a major headwind for Chinese companies. \u201cThe impact of tariffs on trade with China won\u2019t be all that great,\u201d said Carl Weinberg, a longtime China watcher and chief economist with High Frequency Economics. He added that the Biden administration\u2019s new restrictions on high-tech exports to China are more effective, given that Chinese companies have proven adept at avoiding U.S. duties by exporting products indirectly through, for example, Mexico.  Don\u2019t miss: Is this the new normal Xi Jinping promised the Chinese people? Yes and no. From the archives (August 2023): China\u2019s youth job market is a nightmare. It\u2019s changing the face of the country. A recent analysis by the Financial Times found that just as direct trade with China and the U.S. has declined, exports from China to Mexico and from Mexico to China have soared. \u201cThe U.S. is the world\u2019s biggest consumer of stuff; China is the world\u2019s biggest producer of goods,\u201d Robin Brooks, former chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, reportedly told the FT. \u201cOne way or another, these two forces have to meet.\u201d The continued interconnectedness of the U.S. and Chinese economies calls into question the idea that, by investing in U.S. stocks, one is avoiding exposure to China, according to Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at KraneShares, which offers several China-focused ETFs.  \u201cIf you want to avoid China in your portfolio, sell Apple \n        AAPL,\n        -0.22%,\n       sell Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.34%,\n       sell Exxon Mobil \n        XOM,\n        -2.74%,\n       sell Tesla \n        TSLA,\n        -0.91%,\n      \u201d he said. \u201dAll these companies are highly geared toward China.\u201d  Indeed, many companies in the red-hot semiconductor space rely heavily on China for revenue: Qualcomm \n        QCOM,\n        +1.45%,\n       Monolithic Power Systems \n        MPWR,\n        +2.42%\n       and Western Digital \n        WDC,\n        +2.53%\n derive more than 40% of their revenues from China, and each has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year, according to FactSet. The yawning gap in sentiment between Chinese and U.S. stocks can be illustrated by the fact that the 32 companies held in the Krane Shares China internet ETF \n        KWEB,\n       which include firms such as Alibaba and Tencent, have a combined market capitalization of $1.1 trillion, $700 billion less than Amazon.com Inc. \n        AMZN,\n        +3.48%,\n       despite the fact that these companies in aggregate generate more revenue, cash flow and earnings per share than Amazon does, Ahern noted.  It is important for investors to take heed of the negative sentiment weighing on Chinese stocks but also to be aware that the longer-run outperformance by U.S. stocks isn\u2019t a permanent state of affairs, according to Xinchen Yu, an emerging-markets strategist at UBS. He told MarketWatch that investing in foreign companies provides important geographic diversification for U.S. investors, and he expects Chinese stocks to slightly outperform other emerging markets this year. He recommended looking for high-dividend-yield stocks in China, such as utilities or companies that are owned in part by the Chinese government.  The risk associated with a potential Trump win in November and the prospect of subsequent new trade restrictions on China bear watching, but, according to Brian McCarthy, chief strategist at Macrolens and veteran China investor, far more important is Chinese domestic policy.  \u201cTrump\u2019s strategy was to use a credible threat to try to force China to make policy changes, but he capitulated in 2019, and I think we can question just how credible the threat is,\u201d he told MarketWatch. In 2020, as Trump positioned for his failed re-election run and just weeks before the COVID-19 virus caused major disruptions to the global economy, Trump used the threat of increased tariffs to strike a deal with China wherein it agreed to purchase $200 billion in exports by the end of 2021.  Capitol Report (June 2020): Trump asked China\u2019s Xi to buy U.S. farm products to help him win re-election, Bolton book says Also see (June 2020): Bolton book adds urgency to Trump bid to depict himself as a China hawk and to paint Biden as a Beijing apologist China only ended up buying 58% of the exports it had promised \u2014 not even enough to reach the level of its imports Trump started the trade war. \u201cTrump proved in his first term ahead of an election that he was unwilling to go the distance,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201dA stark decoupling with China would cause a global recession and perhaps threaten something worse. So I\u2019m skeptical that Trump would really be willing to go the distance on that.\u201d From the archives: Does Trump\u2019s trade war court American humiliation? Trump will soon end the trade war with China because he doesn\u2019t really care about winning it Escalating U.S.-China trade war threatens global economy, poses Trump re-election risk Trump\u2019s unwinnable trade war with China The trade war is over \u2014 and the winner is China, writes Howard Gold Blinken arrived in China on Wednesday, visiting Shanghai shortly before Biden signed the $95 billion foreign-aid package that has several elements likely to anger Beijing.

            "text": "The U.S. Justice Department is opening a criminal investigation into the \n        Alaska Air Group\n       flight during which a door-sized hole opened up on a \n        Boeing\n       plane midflight, The Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, citing documents it has seen and people familiar with the matter.\u00a0 That had shares down in afternoon trading on Monday. \n        Boeing\n       stock was off 2.8% at $192.94 a share, while the \n        S&P 500\n       was down 01.%. The \n        Dow Jones Industrial Average\n       was up about 0.1%.   It wasn\u2019t the only reason Boeing stock was down. The MAX 10\u2014the longest version of the 737 MAX jet\u2014also weighed on investor sentiment.  The \n        Alaska Air\n       Jan. 5 flight had to make an emergency landing after a door plug blew out of a 737 MAX 9 jet a few minutes after takeoff. No one was hurt in the incident, but Boeing has since been trying hard to reassure passengers and customers that its aircraft are safe. Other Boeing planes were found to have missing bolts when extra inspections were carried out afterward. Boeing declined to comment on the criminal probe.   Government officials have interviewed pilots and attendants on the flight, and investigators have taken steps to notify passengers on the plane that they could potentially be crime victims, the report said.\u00a0\u00a0 In 2021, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion in criminal fines after two deadly 737 MAX crashes within five months that resulted in the worldwide grounding of the jet between March 2019 and November 2020. Those crashes weren\u2019t due to a structural issue, instead, both were tied back to faulty flight control software.  That fine demonstrated \u201cthe consequences of failing to be fully transparent with government regulators,\u201d a Justice Department news release said. \u201cThe public should be confident that government regulators are effectively doing their job, and those they regulate are being truthful and transparent.\u201d The criminal probe comes days after a Federal Aviation Administration six-week audit found \u201cmultiple instances where the companies allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements.\u201d The door blowout and increasing regulatory oversight has weighed on investor sentiment. Coming into Monday trading, Boeing stock was down about 24% so far this year.  Separately, \n        Delta Air Lines\n       CEO Ed Bastian told Bloomberg in an interview that he expects deliveries of Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX 10 aircraft to be delayed until 2027. It wasn\u2019t clear from the remarks if he was referring to the 100 MAX planes Delta had ordered and expected to receive in 2025, or if the model would be more generally delayed. Delta didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Wall Street currently expects the MAX 10 to be certified in 2025 or 2026. William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma pinned Monday\u2019s declines on the MAX 10. \u201cDelta was previously expecting the MAX 10 to be available in 2025,\u201d he wrote in a Monday report.  More delays for the MAX 10\u2014as well as more MAX-related investigations\u2014aren\u2019t what investors want to hear about.  DiPalma rates the shares Buy and doesn\u2019t have a price target for the stock. A Buy-rating at Blair essentially means its analyst expects the stock to outperform the market.

            "text": "Futures at the start of the week suggest the stock market may struggle to rebound from Friday\u2019s selloff. Investors may need to familiarize with a worrying technical phenomenon: the bearish engulfing pattern. The S&P 500 \n        SPX\n       hit a record intraday high of 5,189.3 during the previous session, only to close at 5,123.7. That top to bottom 1.3% retreat reflected an even more concerning day for Nvidia \n        NVDA,\n        +6.22%.\n Shares in the AI-chip maker and driver of market sentiment hit a record high of $974, but closed 5.5% lower at $875.3. It\u2019s a top to bottom range of 10.1% that has produced the aforementioned bearish engulfing pattern (BEP). A BEP occurs when a positive candlestick range \u2014 a technical chart showing a day\u2019s open and close in the thick of the body and a high and low of the day in the wick \u2014 is followed by a wider negative candlestick range. That is considered a pretty concerning dynamic because it shows that not only were traders wanting to sell at the highs, but continued to do so as the market turned negative, suggesting investors were not convinced about the previous day\u2019s gains either. And Nvidia\u2019s BEP was a whopper, as the chart below shows, with the about-turn coming on a record $101 billion of traded value. Michael Kramer at Mott Capital Management stretches technical analysis into the realms of astrophysics as he believes Nvidia imploded on itself \u201clike a star that goes supernova.\u201d \u201c[W]hen a star ages and grows large, its mass increases, and eventually, the mass grows so large that the star collapses on itself,\u201d says Kramer.  With Nvidia, as the price kept rising, its implied volatility was pushed ever higher until eventually it got so rich that it was very difficult for call option buyers to make a profit, he says. Call options give a trader the right to purchase an underlying security at a specified price within a certain time frame. \u201cThat essentially ended the squeeze taking place, causing the stock to collapse,\u201d he says. The charts below shows this in action. Once implied volatility in the $975 call for expiration on March 15 hit 75%, Nvidia\u2019s shares (the orange line) slumped along with the price of the calls. \u201cThis tells us two things for this week: be mindful that where Nvidia goes likely means the market will follow and that a hot CPI print come Tuesday morning may very well matter, and this time, Nvidia may not be able to save it,\u201d says Kramer. Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at BTIG, is of a similar mind: \u201cA consolidation in the AI trade has been overdue for a while now, so Friday\u2019s key reversal day could signal the start of that unwind.\u201d And the market remains overbought, Krinksy reckons, with the S&P 500 about 13% above its 200-day moving average, \u201cabout as wide as the spread tends to get.\u201d The big question for investors, says Krinsky, is if this latest dip represents the beginning of a pullback for previous market leaders, can the slack be picked up by others as buying rotates? The problem with that hope is that correlations are already at their lowest since 2006. \u201cTherefore, if correlations are poised to rise, that suggests a more broad-based selloff may be near,\u201d says Krinksy. \u201cWhile March came in strong like a bull, perhaps it will leave more like a bear, at least in the short-term.\u201d U.S. stock-index futures \n        ES00,\n        +1.04%\nYM00,\n        +0.41%\nNQ00,\n        +1.69%\n       are a bit lower as benchmark Treasury yields \n        BX:TMUBMUSD10Y\n       trade little changed.

            "title": "Week Ahead for FX, Bonds: Focus on U.S. Inflation, China Data",
            "text": "Below are the most important global events likely to affect FX and bond markets in the coming week starting March 11. In the U.S. and Europe, economic data will be watched closely--with U.S. inflation figures on Tuesday to be the highlight--as focus remains on when central banks are likely to start cutting interest rates. In Asia, the data docket is relatively light after an intense week dominated by China's economic blueprint for 2024. More Chinese data are on tap, with data also due from Japan and India, alongside comments from the Reserve Bank of Australia. U.S.: U.S. inflation data for February will be released on Tuesday and be very closely watched given the current intense focus on when the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to start cutting interest rates. Inflation figures for January were unexpectedly high and caused the market to scale back rate-cut forecasts. Investors will be looking to see whether this strong inflation trend continued into February. U.S. February producer price inflation data on Thursday will give an indication of pipeline inflationary pressures. Further U.S. data will provide clues on the health of the U.S. economy, including February retail sales and weekly jobless claims data on Thursday, followed by February industrial production and the University of Michigan March preliminary consumer survey on Friday. Any evidence of the economy slowing could increase expectations for a U.S. rate cut in June, especially after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in testimony before lawmakers that the central bank was on track to cut interest rates this year. The Fed's next meeting is the following week, on March 20. EUROZONE: The European Central Bank left interest rates on hold at its meeting on March 7 and said any cut in interest rates--which most analysts expect in June--will be dependent on upcoming data. Final German CPI data for February are due on Tuesday, with Spanish inflation data due on Thursday. Eurozone industrial production figures for January are due on Wednesday and could give evidence of whether the eurozone's sluggish economy is starting to pick up. The Netherlands, Germany, Italy and probably Portugal will conduct bond auctions in the eurozone, while Switzerland, Sweden and Norway will also issue bonds. U.K.: U.K. unemployment and wages data on Tuesday, then monthly GDP and industrial production data for January on Wednesday, will give an indication of how the U.K. economy is holding up ahead of a Bank of England policy decision the following week, on March 21. Recent data have suggested the U.K. economy has held up reasonably well and any signs of it faltering could alter rate-cut expectations. Most commentators currently expect the BOE to cut interest rates after the U.S. Fed and the European Central Bank. On Tuesday, the U.K.'s Debt Management Office will auction 10-year government bonds, or gilts. CHINA: China's high-level policy meetings--known as the Two Sessions--wrap up with a speech by President Xi on March 11. While no more major headlines are expected, market focus will stay on any follow-up measures to back Beijing's target of around 5% growth for the year. The broad consensus is that it will be tough for China to hit that target. There was also disappointment about the lack of detail on how the country plans to address weaknesses in its economy. More concrete measures would go a long way toward reassuring investors. \"Sentiment bottoming out and recovering will be the main catalyst for a sustainable economic recovery,\" says Lynn Song, ING's chief economist for Greater China. \"The policy rollout in subsequent weeks and months will play a large role in determining whether or not this bottoming out will occur this year.\" The policy implications of data on consumer inflation and factory prices released over the weekend will also be in focus. Deflation in the world's second-largest economy has been a major area of concern, with anemic demand powering down a key engine of growth. Any signs of reflation would likely be welcome. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal see CPI swinging back to positive territory at 0.3% in February from -0.8% in January, with PPI remaining in contraction at -2.5%. Money and credit data for February are also due during the week. \"Although February is typically a month with lower new loan flows, policymakers' guidance to smooth intra-year fluctuations in loan extension may have supported loan growth in February,\" said Arjun Varma and Hui Shan of Goldman Sachs. The central bank has also lowered reserve ratio requirements for banks and guided lenders to lower a key lending rate in February. \"These measures should be supportive to the broad credit growth,\" the GS strategists said. JAPAN: On March 11, Japan will release revised growth estimates for the final quarter of 2023 amid heightened expectations about the central bank's exit from negative interest rates. Preliminary data in February showed that the economy shrank 0.1% in the three months to December from the previous quarter, sparking concerns about a technical recession. However, the drop was small enough to leave room for doubt. The revised data could put the number back in positive territory. Comments from Bank of Japan board member Junko Nakagawa last week that the economy is making steady progress toward achieving its price goal added to expectations that the end of negative rates will be announced in the coming month. AUSTRALIA: The first public comments from the Reserve Bank of Australia's new chief economist will be closely scrutinized. Assistant Governor, Economic, Sarah Hunter is in charge of the central bank's forecasts and her appearance on a panel in Sydney on Tuesday will be her first since data showed the economy slowed to a crawl in the final months of 2023. Still, it is likely the RBA will want to stick to its recent warning that further interest-rate increases cannot be ruled out. Elsewhere, business and consumer confidence data for February and March are expected to confirm that the mood across the economy remains downbeat as unemployment rises while relief for household budgets in the form of interest-rate cuts still seems some time off. INDIA: On Tuesday, consumer and wholesale price data will show how inflationary pressures are holding up in India. The country's central bank has so far held rates steady amid easing inflation and economic resilience, but has said it will carefully monitor food prices. Strategists at Goldman Sachs expect headline CPI inflation to remain unchanged for the month, with core inflation declining slightly but food price inflation remaining elevated. SINGAPORE: On Wednesday, the Monetary Authority of Singapore will release its quarterly survey of professional forecasters, which offers a summary of forecasts of Singapore's key economic indicators by economists and analysts. In the December survey, the respondents estimated that for 2024, Singapore's GDP will expand by 2.3%, headline inflation will come in at 3.4%, and core inflation at 3.0%.

            "text": "SEATTLE \u2014 The Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into the\u00a0Boeing jetliner blowout\u00a0that left a gaping hole on an Alaska Airlines plane this January, the\u00a0Wall Street Journal reported\u00a0on Saturday. Citing documents and people familiar with the matter, the newspaper said investigators have contacted some passengers and crew \u2014 including pilots and flight attendants \u2014 who were on the Jan. 5 flight. The Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.37%\n       plane used by Alaska Airlines \n        ALK,\n        -1.12%\n       suffered the blowout seven minutes after takeoff from Portland, Ore., forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing. Boeing has been under increased scrutiny since the\u00a0incident, when a panel that plugged a space left for an extra emergency door blew off a Max 9 jet. There were no serious injuries. \u201cIn an event like this, it\u2019s normal for the DOJ to be conducting an investigation,\u201d Alaska Airlines said in a prepared statement. \u201cWe are fully cooperating and do not believe we are a target of the investigation.\u201d Boeing declined to comment. DOJ did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The Journal reported that the investigation would assist the Department\u2019s review of whether Boeing complied with a previous settlement that resolved a federal investigation into the safety of its 737 Max aircraft following two deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019. In 2021, Boeing had agreed to pay $2.5 billion, including a $244 million fine, to settle an investigation into the crashes of flights operated by Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines. The company also blamed two employees for deceiving regulators about flaws in the flight-control system. Boeing has acknowledged in a letter to Congress that it cannot find records for work done on the door panel of the Alaska Airlines plane. \u201cWe have looked extensively and have not found any such documentation,\u201d Ziad Ojakli, Boeing executive vice president and chief government lobbyist, wrote to Sen. Maria Cantwell on Friday. The company said its \u201cworking hypothesis\u201d was that the records about the panel\u2019s removal and reinstallation on the 737 Max final assembly line in Renton, Washington, were never created, even though Boeing\u2019s systems required it. The letter,\u00a0reported earlier by The Seattle Times, followed a contentious\u00a0Senate committee hearing\u00a0Wednesday in which Boeing and the National Transportation Safety Board argued over whether the company had cooperated with investigators. The safety board\u2019s chair, Jennifer Homendy, testified that for two months Boeing repeatedly refused to identify employees who work on door panels on Boeing 737s and failed to provide documentation about a repair job that included removing and reinstalling the door panel. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd that two months later we don\u2019t have that,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cWithout that information, that raises concerns about quality assurance, quality management, safety management systems\u201d at Boeing. Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington, demanded a response from Boeing within 48 hours. Shortly after the Senate hearing, Boeing said it had given the NTSB the names of all employees who work on 737 doors \u2014 and had previously shared some of them with investigators. In the letter, Boeing said it had already made clear to the safety board that it couldn\u2019t find the documentation. Until the hearing, it said, \u201cBoeing was not aware of any complaints or concerns about a lack of collaboration.\u201d In a preliminary report last month, the NTSB said four bolts that help keep the door plug in place\u00a0were missing\u00a0after the panel was removed so workers could repair nearby damaged rivets last September. The rivet repairs were done by contractors working for Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems \n        SPR,\n        +2.26%,\n       but the NTSB still does not know who removed and replaced the door panel, Homendy said Wednesday. The Federal Aviation Administration recently gave Boeing\u00a090 days\u00a0to say how it will respond to quality-control issues raised by the agency and a panel of industry and government experts.\u00a0The panel\u00a0found problems in Boeing\u2019s safety culture despite improvements made after two Max 8 jets crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people.

            "text": "Whisper it, but the path to lower interest rates is finally taking a clear shape on both sides of the Atlantic. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell spent the week telling Congress that interest rates will come as soon as there\u2019s enough evidence that inflation is under control. The strength of the economy, of which the better-than-expected jobs report Friday is just the latest surprise, is of secondary importance.\u00a0 Markets have been pricing in a June Fed cut for weeks, and Powell had every opportunity to change those expectations. He didn\u2019t. \u201cWe continue to see a strong chance of a June cut, with the Fed indicating a desire to gradually move policy back to more neutral levels later in the year,\u201d said ING economist James Knightley said after Friday\u2019s jobs numbers. \u201cThis is now fully priced by markets.\u201d Over in Frankfurt, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde tried to keep her rate-cutting cards close to her chest after a rate decision this week, but gave away a big clue when talking about the decisions being data-dependent. \u201cWe will know a little more in April, but we will know a lot more in June,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cLagarde is clearly teeing up markets for a June rate cut, so long as the important data that the ECB monitors continue to evolve in line with recent trends,\u201d said \n        Nomura\n       economist Andrzej Szczepaniak.\u00a0 The Bank of England may also get in on the action. Economists don\u2019t expect a first cut in the U.K. until later in the year, but inflation has been slowing more quickly than the central bank had expected and the economy is in recession.  What\u2019s more, it\u2019s an election year in Britain as well as the U.S.\u2014even though the BOE is independent from the government with a mandate solely focused on inflation, the collective pressure for Governor Andrew Bailey to ease borrowing costs could lead to an earlier move. Put it all together, and the start of rate moves will be a lot more in sync on the way down than on the way up. The BOE started hiking first, way back in December 2021. Then the Fed moved in March 2022 while the ECB waited until July.\u00a0 While it\u2019s important to know when the long-awaited rate cuts will finally come, it\u2019s probably more important to anticipate what happens after that. That\u2019s when the stories on the two sides of the Atlantic will diverge again. Atlanta Fed President Raphel Bostic made some interesting remarks on this on March 4. He said the Fed doesn\u2019t need to act with urgency in bringing rates down, and suggested that the central bank could take a long pause after the first cut to see how the economy reacts. It\u2019s a very different story in Europe. The economy there is on its knees\u2013the U.K. is in recession, and the 20-nation euro area is flatlining. While inflation is still too strong for policymakers to deliver relief now, as soon as they feel confident that inflation is conquered, there\u2019s no reason to think they\u2019ll take a snail\u2019s pace on rate cuts. Nomura\u2019s Szczepaniak sees the ECB\u2019s June cut being the first in a series of five quarter-point reductions.\u00a0 Inflation has come down impressively, but keeping it lower is harder when a robust economy supports demand. That\u2019s an issue for the Fed. Europe\u2019s weak economy should make it easier for the ECB to contain inflation with lower rates. This divergence has important implications for investors. For one, it will guide currency movements. The dollar weakened against the euro the first two months of the year as traders planned on the Fed cutting first, but it has started to strengthen since mid-February as outlook shifted. A stronger dollar is usually bad for U.S. firms selling things overseas because it reduces the value of foreign sales. If Europe does cut rates more aggressively once it gets started, that could be a boost for companies across the pond. European shares already trade at a substantial discount\u2013the average price-to-year ahead earnings ratio on the STOXX Europe 600 is 13.5. For the S&P 500, it\u2019s 20.6. Rate cuts are good for stocks. If the market\u2019s expectations are correct, June could see the sun shine on investors.

            "text": "Boeing\u2019s new tool for fixing quality and manufacturing problems just might be cash. That\u2019s fine, just so long as it\u2019s one of many tools \n        Boeing\n       uses to turn things around.  Recently, Boeing told employees it was overhauling incentives for some workers in its commercial aerospace division. Safety and quality metrics will determine 60% of annual bonuses, up from 25% previously. The balance is a mix of financial-based metrics. Within\u00a0Boeing\u2019s defense business, operating metrics that impact bonuses will focus solely on safety and quality. Those metrics will continue to represent 25% of bonus scores.  \u201cEach and every one of you should see these at your level with your contribution,\u201d said Boeing COO Stephanie Pope in an all-employee webcast. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t, please get with your manager. It\u2019s very, very important to drive the outcomes that we\u2019re all committed to, and that\u2019s to deliver a safe and quality product to our customer.\u201d It appears to be a sensible move. Boeing stock, however, closed down 2.2% in Friday trading at $198.49, a signal that investors understand fixing quality, manufacturing, and design problems is a long process. The \n        S&P 500\n       and \n        Nasdaq Composite\n       fell 0.7% and 1.2%, respectively.  All of Boeing\u2019s recent moves come in the aftermath of an incident in early January when an emergency door plug blew out of a 737 MAX 9 flight operated by \n        Alaska Air.\n       The FAA grounded all MAX 9 jets after the incident. They were returned to service after all the planes were inspected and any required repairs made.  The MAX 9 is one of two versions of the MAX aircraft certified to fly. It is a little longer than the MAX 8, which accounts for a majority of MAX jets in service. All MAX jets were grounded worldwide between March 2019 and November 2020 following two deadly crashes tied to faulty flight control software.  All the MAX issues have weighed heavily on investor sentiment. Boeing stock was north of $400 a share before the second fatal MAX crash in March 2019. Shares traded just above $200 in premarket trading, down about 19% since the MAX 9 incident on Jan. 5. Boeing has been doing more than just changing pay to improve its processes. Several top managers have been replaced over the past five years\u2014including the chief executive. Current CEO Dave Calhoun has reorganized the global engineering organization. Boeing also recently confirmed it is in talks to acquire fuselage supplier \n        Spirit AeroSystems, \n      a move that would give Boeing more direct control over production.  There is no quick fix. The Federal Aviation Administration said Monday, after a six-week audit, that it found \u201cmultiple instances\u201d in which Boeing failed to comply with its own manufacturing quality-control requirements.  \u201cBy virtue of our quality [meetings], the FAA audit findings, and the recent expert review panel report, we have a clear picture of what needs to be done,\u201d said Calhoun after the FAA\u2019s statement was released. \u201cTransparency prevailed in all of these discussions. Boeing will develop the comprehensive action plan with measurable criteria that demonstrates the profound change that [FAA] Administrator Whitaker and the FAA demand.\u201d  Calhoun has pushed transparency in dealing with regulators, investors, and the media as well. That is a good idea, too.  \u201cI give Dave Calhoun a lot of credit,\u201d said \n        General Electric\n       CEO Larry Culp at GE Aerospace\u2019s analyst event in New York on Thursday. GE is a key engine supplier to the aircraft maker. \u201cI think he\u2019s doing all he can to galvanize that organization.\u201d  Maintaining confidence among suppliers is key for Boeing. Now they have to win back the confidence of regulators and the flying public.

Growth in GE\u2019s backlog of new engines plus maintenance needs for its 44,000-engine  commercial engine fleet provides a visible opportunity for the company. \u201cThe fact that this installed base is growing is quite important because this provides the foundation for future earnings,\u201d Seifman said.

            "text": "It\u2019s time to buy the pound, Bank of America says, as the U.K. currency hits a seven-month high versus the U.S. dollar. A somewhat softer-than-expected U.S. jobs report released Friday contributed to the British pound \n        GBPUSD,\n        -0.11%\n       gaining 0.5% to trade at $1.287, the highest level since July. A reduction of political risks, sticky British inflation and technical tailwinds could see cable, as the exchange rate between the pound and the dollar is known, quickly rise to the $1.30 to $1.314 range, said Bank of America strategists led by Kamal Sharma. Expected yield differentials are one factor underpinning the pound. With U.K. inflation at 4.2%, more than twice the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, its monetary-policy committee is not expected to start reducing interest rates from their current 5.25% until August, according to pricing in swaps markets. The Federal Reserve and European Central Bank are considered likely to start trimming borrowing costs in June. \u201cWe expect the BOE to remain resolute in its current stance and reassured by recent consensus upgrades to U.K. growth,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cThis should provide a strong cyclical basis for [pound] outperformance.\u201d Another factor supporting the pound is that the government\u2019s spring budget this week contained no damaging surprises. \u201cMuch of content of the Budget had been well trailed by the media and just as much as there were no \u2018rabbits out of the hat,\u2019 there were equally no negative surprises that could have destabilized either the Gilt [bond] market or [the pound],\u201d said the BoA team. Other observers have noted that U.K. political risk has also declined because the election this year is likely to be won by the opposition Labour Party, which is deemed by many analysts to be more economically competent than recent Conservative administrations. Bank of America also said that with Brexit now out of the way \u2014 an issue that has weighed on sterling since the 2016 vote to leave the European Union \u2014 they expect that corporate repatriation of foreign earnings for paying pound-denominated dividends will support sterling. \u201cGiven that a large proportion of U.K.-listed companies (energy and basic materials) are [dollar] functional, we would expect GBP/USD to be the main beneficiary of such flows,\u201d Bank of America said. Finally, technical factors suggest \u201ca bullish cup-and-handle pattern is forming,\u201d Bank of America said.  \u201cA breakout above the cup line at 1.2819-1.2827 will confirm it and signals upside to 1.30/1.3140. Medium term, this pattern can also suggest upside to 1.3315 and possibly 1.3610.\u201d Thursday\u2019s U.S. economic data is ringing alarm bells in the minds of traders, economists and others, who are beginning to voice concerns that the world\u2019s largest economy could be shifting into a stagflation-type of environment.

            "text": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A United Airlines jetliner bound for Japan made a safe landing in Los Angeles on Thursday after losing a tire while taking off from San Francisco. Video shows the plane losing one of the six tires on its left-side main landing gear assembly seconds after takeoff. The tire landed in an employee parking lot at San Francisco International Airport, where it smashed into a car and shattered its back window before breaking through a fence and coming to stop in a neighboring lot. No one was injured, airport spokesman Doug Yakel said in a statement. Fire engines stood by at Los Angeles International Airport but weren\u2019t needed, as the Boeing 777 made an uneventful landing and stopped about two-thirds of the way down a runway. Airport spokesman Dae Levine said the plane landed safely. It was then towed away. The flight carried 235 passengers and a crew of 14, United \n        UAL,\n        -1.25%\n       said. The airline said that the plane, built in 2002, was designed to land safely with missing or damaged tires. The passengers will be moved to another plane for the rest of the trip, United said. Boeing 777s have six tires on each of the two main landing gears. Video of Flight 35 departing shows the plane losing one of the six tires on its left-side main landing gear assembly seconds after takeoff. Aviation experts said planes losing tires is a rare occurrence and not indicative of a larger safety issue. \u201cIn aviation, we never want to have single points of failure if they can be avoided, and this is a case in point,\u201d said Alan Price, a former chief pilot for Delta Air Lines. \u201cThe remaining tires are fully capable of handling the load,\u201d he added. Price said a loose tire is normally a maintenance issue and not a problem created by the manufacturer. John Cox, a retired pilot and professor of aviation safety at the University of Southern California, agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t see any impact for Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.25%\n       as it was a United maintenance team that changed the tire,\u201d he said. The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate, spokesman Tony Molinaro said. Alphabet shares surge after Google\u2019s parent posts better-than-expected earnings and announces its first cash dividend, Microsoft posts 31% quarterly growth in Azure cloud-computing revenue, and Exxon Mobil\u2019s earnings miss estimates.

            "text": "Executives at General Electric\u2019s jet-engine unit met with investors to tell them about the business\u2019s prospects as an independent company. Their biggest challenge may be living up to Wall Street\u2019s existing enthusiasm. Management came out swinging. GE started the day by offering investors a look into 2028. It hopes to produce $10 billion in operating profit, up from about $6.3 billion expected in 2024. That works out to an average annual growth rate of roughly 12%. GE stock was rising 2.2% on Thursday to $162.94 a share, while the \n        S&P 500\n       and \n        Dow Jones Industrial Average\n       were up 0.9% and 0.4%, respectively.  On April 2, GE will split into two companies\u2014the jet engine business, called GE Aerospace, and GE Vernova, a power-generation company. GE Vernova held an investor day on Wednesday. GE Aerospace management spoke Thursday.  Along with a look into 2028, GE reiterated details of financial guidance it gave in January. In 2024, GE Aerospace should grow sales at \u201clow double digits [percentage] or more, \u201d which points to an increase of 10% or 11% from 2023. Operating profit in 2024 should come in at $6 billion to $6.5 billion, with free cash flow of more than $5 billion.  GE Aerospace generated 2023 sales of $31.8 billion, up 22% from 2022. Operating profit came in at $6.1 billion, although GE said that number would have been closer to $5.6 billion if GE Aerospace had been a standalone company in 2023.   In 2025, GE Aerospace expects another year of double-digit sales growth and operating profit of $7.1 billion to $7.5 billion.  Sales are growing that fast because the global aerospace industry is continuing to recover from the pandemic. Global passenger traffic in January reached 99.6% of 2019 levels, according to the International Air Transport Association. \u201cFive lost years,\u201d noted Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu in a report Wednesday. The pandemic is behind the company now. GE Aerospace expects global airline passenger traffic to grow about 7% a year, on average, between 2023 and 2028.  Kahyaoglu wrote Thursday that Aerospace\u2019s 2028 guidance implies operating profit margins in the low 20% range, up from about 18% expected in 2024.  Margins might dip this year because of the mix of new engine sales to service sales, although some of the dip is due to comparability. New engine sales have lower profit margins than service sales. Operating profit margins in 2023 came in at 19.2%; GE said 2023 adjusted operating profit margins\u2014accounting for standalone company costs\u2014came in at about 17.6%. Both numbers are already better than for manufacturers in general or other aerospace companies.  The average operating profit margin for manufacturing stocks in the S&P 500 is about 16%, according to Bloomberg. The average margin for aerospace and defense companies is about 14%, not counting \n        Boeing,\n       which has run into problems with its MAX jet in recent years. Boeing reported a 2023 operating profit margin of negative 1%. Growth is another reason investors like GE Aerospace. The number of planes flying people around is expected to roughly double over the coming 20 years. That works out to an average annual growth rate of about 4%. All of those planes need engines, and GE engines power roughly three of every four commercial flights today.  GE also expects global defense budgets to hit $2.1 trillion in 2028, up from $1.8 trillion in 2023, which works out to an average annual growth rate of about 3% and provides a tailwind for GE Aeropsace\u2019s $9 billion defense business. The company expects to outperform the global growth rate, expanding sales at \u201cmid- to high-single digits\u201d for the coming five years.   Kahyaoglu values GE Aerospace at 17 times the roughly $9.2 billion of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization she expects the company to produce in 2024. That implies a business value for GE Aerospace of about $156 billion. GE\u2019s total business value today is about $171 billion. Turning business values into stock prices, Kahyaoglu has a $180 price target for GE stock. About $146 of that is GE Aerospace. Another $25 is GE Vernova. Adjustments for debt, cash, and investments account for the remainder.   TD Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna raised his GE stock price target to $175 a share from $155 on Thursday. He values Aerospace at about $155 a share and GE Vernova\u2014GE\u2019s power generation businesses\u2014at about $20 a share.  Investors can expect more estimates\u2014and more math\u2014from Wall Street analysts in the coming days. Khanna rates GE shares at Hold. Kahyaoglu rates GE shares at Buy. Overall,  68% of the analysts covering the company rate shares Buy. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&P 500 is about 55%. The average analyst price target for GE shares is about $163. Through Wednesday trading, GE stock has risen about 83% over the past 12 months, while the S&P 500 had risen about 28%.

            "text": "By Christian Moess Laursen Harbour Energy on Thursday reported a slump in full-year profit on lower oil and gas production and prices. Here is what the FTSE 250 energy company had to say. On production: \"Production averaged 186,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (2022: 208,000 BOE per day), split 52 per cent natural gas and 48 per cent liquids and in line with guidance. In the U.K., we delivered higher production from our operated J-Area hub, supported by new wells on-stream around the end of 2022, while our operated Greater Britannia Area continued to outperform expectations.\" This was offset by the deferral of drilling at partner-operated hubs resulting in fewer wells on-stream later in the year. Production was also impacted by some extended shutdowns in the second half of the year, including at our operated AELE hub and the East Irish Sea assets.\" On revenue: \"Revenue earned from hydrocarbon production activities decreased to $3.68 billion (2022: $5.35 billion) after realized hedging losses of $911 million (2022: $3.185 billion). This decrease was mainly driven by lower post-hedging realized UK natural gas prices and reduced production volumes.\" \"Crude oil sales decreased to $2.09 billion (2022: $2.79 billion) after realized hedging losses of $93 million (2022: $753 million). This was driven by lower production volumes, with our realized post-hedging oil price stable at $78 per barrel (2022: $78 per barrel).\" \"Gas revenue was $1.415 billion (2022: $2.32 billion), split between U.K. natural gas revenue of $1.28 billion (2022: $2.14 billion) including realized hedging losses of $818 million and international gas revenue of $131 million (2022: $180 million). The realized post-hedging price for our U.K. and Indonesia gas was 54 pence per therm (2022: 86 pence per therm) and $13 per thousand-standard-cubic-feet (2022: $14 per MSCF), respectively.\" On costs: \"Cost of operations decreased to $2.36 billion (2022: $2.845 billion) driven primarily by a positive movement in hydrocarbon inventories and (over)/underlift.\" \"Total operating costs were flat year on year at $1.115 billion (2022: $1.06 billion) driven by strong cost control in an inflationary environment. Operating costs were higher on a unit of production basis at $16.4 per BOE (2022: $13.9 per BOE) due to lower production volumes.\" Write to Christian Moess Laursen at christian.moess@wsj.com The Google parent posts earnings ahead of expectations, helped in part by AI-driven demand for cloud computing.

            "title": "NTSB says Boeing has not provided key work records about 737 Max midair blowout",
            "text": "Boeing and the National Transportation Safety Board argued Wednesday over whether the company has cooperated with investigators looking into the blowout of a door-plug panel on one of its planes during a flight in January. The safety board\u2019s chair, Jennifer Homendy, told a Senate Committee that for two months Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.27%\n       repeatedly refused to identify employees who work on door panels on Boeing 737s. Investigators want to interview them. Homendy also said the company has failed to provide documentation about a repair job that included removing and reinstalling the panel on the Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 that suffered the blowout \u2014 or even whether Boeing kept records. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd that two months later we don\u2019t have that,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cWithout that information, that raises concerns about quality assurance, quality management, safety management systems\u201d at Boeing. Shortly after the Senate hearing ended, Boeing responded that it gave the NTSB the names of all employees who work on 737 doors \u2014 and had previously shared some of them with investigators. \u201cEarly in the investigation, we provided the NTSB with names of Boeing employees, including door specialists, who we believed would have relevant information,\u201d a company spokesman said in a statement. \u201cWe have now provided the full list of individuals on the 737 door team, in response to a recent request.\u201d NTSB fired back, saying that Homendy \u201cstands behind her accurate testimony\u201d to the Senate Commerce Committee. It is still not clear whether Boeing kept records about who removed the plug \u2014 a panel that takes the place of extra emergency doors when those doors are not required \u2014 on the Alaska plane last September. \u201cIf the door plug removal was undocumented there would be no documentation to share,\u201d Boeing said. Boeing has been under increasing scrutiny since the\u00a0Jan. 5 incident\u00a0in which a panel that plugged a space left for an extra emergency door blew off an Alaska Airlines \n        ALK,\n        -1.35%\n       Max 9. Pilots were able to land safely, and there were no injuries. In a preliminary report last month, the NTSB said four bolts that help keep the door plug in place\u00a0were missing\u00a0after the panel was removed so workers could repair nearby damaged rivets last September. The rivet repairs were done by contractors working for Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems \n        SPR,\n        +2.11%,\n       but the NTSB still does not know who removed and replaced the door panel, Homendy said Wednesday. Homendy said Boeing has a 25-member team led by a manager, but Boeing has declined repeated requests for their names. The manager of the team is on medical leave and unavailable, and security-camera footage that might have shown who removed the panel was erased and recorded over 30 days later, she said. Lawmakers seemed stunned. \u201cThat is utterly unacceptable,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., accused Boeing of failing to emphasize safety, which \u201cendangered the lives of the 180 passengers and crew aboard the Alaska Airlines flight.\u201d Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., who represents the state where Max jetliners are assembled, said she would press Boeing to cooperate with NTSB. She also noted that Boeing is a leading U.S. exporter and major defense contractor. \u201cWe need to get this right,\u201d Cantwell said. \u201cWe need to help with the investigation so we can find out what in our system needs to be improved.\u201d The Federal Aviation Administration recently gave Boeing\u00a090 days\u00a0to say how it will respond to quality-control issues raised by the agency and a panel of industry and government experts.\u00a0The panel\u00a0found problems in Boeing\u2019s safety culture despite improvements made after two Max 8 jets crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people.

            "text": "U.S. stocks tumbled for a second day on Tuesday as technology shares came under pressure, dragged down by Apple\u2019s continued slump, while investors remained cautious ahead of closely watched remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and labor-market data, both of which should offer more clues on the central bank\u2019s interest-rate path and the health of the economy.  On Tuesday, all three major indexes suffered their largest daily point and percentage decline since Feb. 13, while booking back-to-back losses after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq pulled back Monday from record finishes scored at the end of last week, according to Dow Jones Market Data.  Tuesday\u2019s trading session saw investors taking a cautious tone, with megacap tech stocks tumbling, dragging the market further from record highs reached over the past few weeks.  So far, the year has been good for U.S. stocks as investors have navigated moderating inflation, consistent economic growth and uncertainty over the Federal Reserve\u2019s next move on interest rates.  However, until investors see a fresh round of economic data and speeches on these topics later this week, it\u2019s still a risk-off mood in the financial market \u2014 at least for equities. Bitcoin \n        BTCUSD,\n        -1.50%\n       notched a new record high on Tuesday morning, briefly moving past $69,000, before plummeting to trade above $63,000 a coin Tuesday afternoon. There\u2019s good reason for the scrutiny, said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. \u201cThis is an important week for\u00a0a market that has been pricing in a host, a series, of rate cuts,\u201d she told MarketWatch via phone on Tuesday. Investors will brace for remarks from Fed Chair Powell \u2014 who is expected to deliver monetary-policy updates to the House of Representatives on Wednesday and to the Senate on Thursday \u2014 while listening hard for clues on the pace, timing and extent of any interest-rate cuts for the rest of 2024, she said. Until then, Krosby said she saw the selloff on Tuesday as a \u201chealthy\u201d consolidation, because investors \u201cneed to digest the gains\u201d from last few weeks.  Greg W. Halter, director of research at Carnegie Investment Counsel, also said the pullback was natural, adding that some investors may seize the chance to take profits and shift into the remaining 493 companies in the S&P 500 that are trading at lower valuations.  \u201cThe market is broadening out, but the question of debate is can the market [continue to] go higher if you don\u2019t have Microsoft \n        MSFT,\n        +1.82%,\n       Apple and Nvidia \n        NVDA,\n        +6.18%\n       being the leaders,\u201d Halter said in a phone interview with MarketWatch.  In U.S. economic data on Tuesday, the ISM service-sector PMI fell to 52.6% in February from 53.4% in January, marking a bigger-than-expected drop. Still, a number over 50% signals economic expansion, where the index has been since December 2022.   Factory orders also fell 3.6% in January, dragged down by fewer contracts for passenger airplanes from Boeing.   Tuesday also saw pressure from a dip in Apple Inc.\u2019s \n        AAPL,\n        -0.35%\n       shares weighing on the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500. The company\u2019s shares fell 2.8% after a report that iPhone sales in China fell 24% during the first six weeks of the year. Jamie Chisholm contributed.

            "text": "The numbers: U.S. factory orders fell 3.6% in January large due to fewer contracts for Boeing passenger planes, but there was not much sign of a broad revival among manufacturers. Economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal had forecast a 3.1% decline.   If transportation is excluded, orders for manufactured goods dropped a smaller 0.8%, the government said. Key details: Businesses are investing plenty in new computing power, an offshoot of Bide subsidies and the budding artificial-intelligence revolution. Spending is up sharply compared to a year earlier. All other major areas of the industrial sector are quite weak, however. Orders for durable goods plunged 6.2% last month, a tick higher than previously reported. Core capital goods orders, a proxy for broader business investment, was flat in January. Initially the government reported a 0.1% gain. These orders are down slightly compared to a year earlier. Shipments of manufactured goods already produced fell almost 1% and have declined in four of the past five months. These figures are factored into gross domestic product report \u2014 the official scorecard of the U.S. economy \u2014 and suggest GDP in the first quarter might not get much help from business investment. Big picture: Manufacturers have struggled to achieve robust growth for the past few years because of shifting consumer spending habits and higher interest rates orchestrated by the Federal Reserve to quell inflation. Large subsidies and incentives by the Biden administration have helped to prop up industrial spending to some extent, but manufacturers could get a boost later in the year if the Fed cuts interest rates as expected.  That could help increase business investment once borrowing costs get cheaper. Looking ahead: \u201cServices have been holding up better than factories,\u201d said Neil Dutta, head of macroeconomics at Renaissance Macro Research.  Market reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average \n        DJIA\n       and S&P500 \n        SPX\n       fell in Tuesday trades.

The drop was bigger than expected. Economists polled by the Wall Street Journal had expected the ISM index to inch lower to 53.1%. Numbers over 50% indicate expansion in the economy. The nonmanufacturing index has been above 50% since December 2022. A separate gauge, the S&P Global U.S. Services PMI, posted 52.3% in its final reading in February. That\u2019s up from a flash reading of 51.3%. The PMI was 52.5% in January. Key details: A measure of new orders was 56.1% in February,\u00a0up from 55% in the prior month. The employment gauge contracted for the second time in three months, falling to 48% from 50.5% in the prior month. A measure of prices paid for services fell to 58.6% from 64% in January.  While that\u2019s a slowdown from the prior month, upward price pressures continue. Big picture: The service sector has been an important ingredient in keeping the economy surprisingly strong over the past six months. The pace hasn\u2019t been strong, but it has been steady. \u201cThe report continues to reflect steady, incremental growth for the services sector,\u201d said Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM\u2019s service PMI survey. He noted that prices continue to rise, even if it is at a subdued pace. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing prices continue of this trend of increasing,\u201d Nieves said. He noted that the trend has been ongoing for almost seven years.  Higher service inflation is one reason the Federal Reserve is being cautious about cutting interest rates.

Joyce, president of Houston financial advisory Joyce Wealth Management. \"Maybe the animal spirits are back out now as far as the emotions of market ... it does seem to be quite a bit of momentum.\" In other \"spirit\"-related developments, JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines terminated their merger agreement, weeks after a judge ruled that the $3.8 billion deal would reduce competition and harm cost-conscious fliers. An audit by U.S. regulators in response to a mid flight Alaska Air incident in January found that Boeing allegedly failed to comply with quality-control requirements in manufacturing. Shares of Spirit Aerosystems, the company that made the fuselage involved in the Alaska Air mishap, rose in anticipation of Boeing repurchasing its former unit. \"Boeing needs to get some things corrected, and to take one of its biggest suppliers back under its wing could be a good way to get quality control back,\" said Joyce. Vista Outdoor has rejected MNC Capital Partners' $2.9 billion buyout offer, saying the proposal undervalues the maker of the ammunition and outdoors equipment.

            "text": "Shares of Boeing Co. turned higher Monday after American Airlines Group Inc. included the aerospace giant\u2019s troubled 737 Max line in its orders for 260 new aircraft, which aims at boosting premium seating by 20%. American said its orders include 85 Boeing 737 Max 10s, 85 Airbus A321neo and 90 Embraer E175 aircraft, with options and rights to buy an additional 193 aircraft. As part of the Boeing orders, American said it converted 30 existing 737 Max 8 orders to 737 Max 10 aircraft.  The order \u201cprovides a lift for the Max 10, but does not provide clarity on expected delivery timeline,\u201d Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said in a note to clients Monday. With the new order, American has a backlog of more than 150 of the 737 Max, up from 71 previously, Kahyaoglu said.  Although American did not provide an exact timeline for deliveries, it said \u201cit is planning for the future with its new order, and looks forward to cert of the aircraft and its addition to its fleet,\u201d the analyst said.  Boeing\u2019s stock \n        BA,\n        +0.27%\n       gained 0.5% in midday trading, after trading down as much as 1.5% earlier in the session. The gain comes after the stock closed at a four-month low of $200.00 on Friday. The U.S.-listed shares of Airbus SE \n        EADSY,\n        +0.84%\nAIR,\n        -0.92%\n       rose 2% on Monday, and those of Embraer S.A. \n        ERJ,\n        +3.94%\nEMY,\n        +9.09%\n       advanced 3.1%. Meanwhile, American Airlines stock \n        AAL,\n        -1.77%\n       swung to a loss of 4%, from a gain of as much as 3.1% before the orders announcement. \u201cWe deeply appreciate American Airlines\u2019 trust in Boeing and its confidence in the 737 Max family,\u201d said Stan Deal, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. \u201cAmerican\u2019s selection of the 737-10 will provide even greater efficiency, commonality and flexibility for its global network and operations.\u201d The orders come as Boeing has been dealing with a call from regulators to fix problems with quality regarding the 737 Max jets.

Also read: Boeing confirms talks with Spirit AeroSystems as it aims to \u2018improve quality.\u2019 American said the orders are part of its plan to expand premium seating across its narrow-body and regional fleets and to upgrade its fleet to more efficient aircraft. The air carrier expects premium seating in its fleet to grow by more than 20% by 2026. \u201cThe aircraft orders support American\u2019s measured growth into the next decade and smooth the delivery schedule in the coming years,\u201d American said. Including the new orders, American said it expects to remain within its previously announced guidance for capacity and capital expenditures. In January, the company said it expects 2024 capacity to grow in the mid-single digits percentage range and aircraft capex to be about $2.3 billion. Claudia Assis in San Francisco contributed.

            "title": "Boeing\u2019s Talks to Buy Spirit Aero Has Wall Street Buzzing",
            "text": "\nBoeing\n       is in talks to acquire its fuselage provider \n        Spirit AeroSystems\n       as both companies look to improve quality amid recent manufacturing problems with the 737 MAX jet. Now Wall Street is weighing in on the possibility of buying back a supplier once part of Boeing.  Friday, both companies confirmed the talks originally reported by The Wall Street Journal.  Spirit Aero generates about 60% of sales from Boeing, partly because it was once part of that company. Boeing sold Spirit Aero to private-equity firm Onex in 2005. About a year later, Spirit Aero became a publicly traded company offering shares at $29 apiece.  Shares have had a disappointing run. Spirit Aero stock has spent most of 2024 below that level. However, they jumped 15.3% on Friday to $32.98 as news of the takeover talks leaked out. Spirit Aero shares were up another 2.6% in premarket trading Monday at $33.85 apiece, while \n        S&P 500\n       and \n        Dow Jones Industrial Average\n       futures were down 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively. Boeing shares were down 0.1% in early Monday trading after falling 1.8% on Friday. \u201cIn a perfect world, Spirit AeroSystems handles its manufacturing issues in-house and the arm\u2019s-length relationship continues together as [production] rates ramp and both enjoy improved profits and cash,\u201d wrote Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu in a Sunday report. \u201cHowever, Spirit AeroSystem\u2019s livelihood is an existential threat to Boeing, so the cards are on the table to ensure and protect the 737 MAX program in the face of \n        Airbus\n       competition. Both companies\u2019 success is tied to the other\u2019s.\u201d Spirit Aero makes about 70% of the fuselage for a 737 MAX jet. Some of the manufacturing Kahyaoglu referenced are improperly drilled holes on some 737 MAX jets and some tolerance problems on 787 jets. \u201cOur take is there is a price for everything, but buying a troubled supplier is a strategic pivot from prior thinking,\u201d added Kahyaoglu. She estimates that bringing back Spirit Aero could save up to $400 million a year for Boeing. Kahyaoglu rates Boeing stock is Buy with a $300 price target. She rates Spirit Aero stock at Buy with a $40 price target.  CFRA analyst Stewart Glickman is on the other side of the spectrum with a Sell rating on Boeing stock with a $194 price target. \u201cWe think Boeing is turning over every stone to prevent more defects from occurring,\u201d Glickman wrote in a Friday report. \u201cWe note possible complications for Airbus, given that Spirit AeroSystems also produces fuselages for Airbus.\u201d  Spirit Aero logged about $1.1 billion in sales from Airbus in 2023. That works out to about 2.5% of Airbus\u2019 operating expenses, according to Glickman.  Boeing will probably have to sell the Airbus business if it takes over Spirit Aero. \u201cWe suspect neither Airbus nor Boeing would like Boeing to supply Airbus,\u201d wrote Citi analyst Charles Armitage in a Friday report. He believes it\u2019s likely that Boeing will sell Spirit Aero\u2019s Airbus business to Airbus, and that the price won\u2019t be material to the European airplane maker. He rates Airbus stock at Buy with a \u20ac190 price target. Airbus stock was at \u20ac154.98, up 1.5%, in overseas trading Monday.  Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard called any Boeing-Sprit Aero tie-up neutral for Airbus. He added that a deal is \u201cgreat for Spirit, not so great for Boeing,\u201d in a Friday report. Stallard rates Spirit Aero stock at Hold with a $31 price target, and rates Boeing stock at Hold with a $230 price target. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been riding the Spirit roller coaster, this might be a good opportunity to take profits,\u201d added Stallard. \u201cFor\u00a0Boeing, buying Spirit could have long-term benefits but in the immediate term it would probably just add to their problems.\u201d Boeing would be reintegrating a business while trying to improve quality and ramp production of one of its most important planes, the MAX, amid higher regulatory scrutiny.  Staying apart or joining up presents problems\u2014and opportunities. In the end, Boeing might be forced to do something bold.

            "title": "GE Is About to Break Up. How Much Is Each Part Worth?",
            "text": "\nGeneral Electric\u2019s\nsplit into two businesses\u2014one dedicated to aircraft engines and the other to power generation\u2014raises the question of what each part is worth.  The split is due to take effect April 2. A starting point in solving the valuation problem is to look at how similar companies trade in the marketplace.  Today, General Electric trades for about 14.5 times estimated 2024 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda. That is very similar to nonfinancial and manufacturing companies in the \n        S&P 500,\n       but that data point is only worth so much. There will be no \u201cGeneral Electric\u201d for investors to reference in just a few weeks.  There will be GE Aerospace, which keeps the \u201cGE\u201d stock symbol and is considered to be an excellent business by most on Wall Street. That means it should get a premium valuation.  Aerospace and defense stocks in the U.S. trade for an average of about 18 times estimated 2024 Ebitda. There is a wide range, though, which partly depends on growth and margins. \n        Heico\n       trades for 26 times Ebitda. Its sales have grown more than 10% a year on average for the past few years.  \nBoeing\n       trades for almost 26 times while \n        Airbus\n       sells for 11. They are similar companies, but Boeing\u2019s profit margins have been depressed by problems with its 737 MAX jet and defense business. Investors expect margins to improve over time.  Heico achieves that growth partly via acquisition. GE Aerospace should be able to grow sales by 4% to 5% a year on average just by market growth alone. The number of planes in global fleets grows about 3% to 4% a year. GE gets some benefits for innovation as well as pricing.  At 18 times estimated Ebitda, GE Aerospace would account for roughly 85% to 90% of the value of the pre-spin General Electric. That leaves about $20 billion to $30 billion in value for GE Vernova\u2014GE\u2019s gas power, wind turbine, and electricity-grid businesses.  Valuing Vernova is trickier than assessing what GE Aerospace is worth. For starters, Vernova has been working to improve underperforming business units for years. What\u2019s more, some companies do some of what GE Vernova does, but no single company does everything. Few of those that are most comparable to Vernova are U.S.-based.  Japanese-based \n        Mitsubishi Heavy Industries\n       makes gas turbines but does other things as well. \n        Schneider Electric\n       has power grid-related businesses, but it earns much higher margins than GE\u2019s grid business. \n        Siemens Energy\n       and \n        Vestas Wind Systems\n       both make wind turbines, so they offer some help to investors, but they don\u2019t trade similarly to one another.  Another way to value Vernova is to look at U.S. manufacturing companies. They trade for an average of about 12 times estimated 2024 Ebitda. That might be a multiple GE Vernova can strive to get as it continues to improve margins and turn around its money-losing wind turbine business.  GE Vernova didn\u2019t make a bottom-line profit in 2023. It did generate positive free cash flow of about $440 million, which the company expects to improve to about $900 million in 2024. Ebitda in 2023 amounted to about $800 million. That should improve to about $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion in 2024.  That Ebitda implies a 2024 Ebitda margin of about 6% to 7%. Eventually, Vernova will have to get to double-digit Ebitda margins if it hopes to get that higher multiple.  Investors will hear how Vernova management plans to achieve that at an investor day in New York on Wednesday. Investors will hear from GE Aerospace management on Thursday.  Through Friday trading, GE stock was up some 90% over the past 12 months. The \n        S&P 500\n       and \n        Dow Jones Industrial Average\n       were up about 27% and 17%, respectively.

            "text": "Shares of \n        Spirit AeroSystems\n       have taken off in response to news that \n        Boeing\n       is in talks to buy the supplier it once owned.  Boeing confirmed the discussions late Friday, following a report by the Wall Street Journal. A deal for Spirt would be a strategic pivot for Boeing and would highlight that spinning out company-owned supply businesses isn\u2019t really a great idea.  Spirit Aero stock closed up 15.3% at $32.98 on Friday. Boeing stock closed down 1.8%, while the \n        S&P 500\n       was up about 0.8%. Spirit shares added 2.2% in after-hours trading after Boeing confirmed talks.  \u201cWe have been working closely with Spirit AeroSystems and its leadership to strengthen the quality of the commercial airplanes that we build together. We confirm that our collaboration has resulted in preliminary discussions about making Spirit AeroSystems a part of\u00a0Boeing\u00a0again,\u201d said the company in an emailed statement. \u00a0 Spirit AeroSystems didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.  Spirit Aero makes fuselages for both Boeing and \n        Airbus\n      \u2014including a large portion of the fuselage for a 737 MAX jet. Some 60% of Spirt Aero\u2019s sales come from Boeing. Airbus is responsible for about 20%.  Spirit Aero was once a part of Boeing. The company became a publicly traded company in a November 2006 initial public offering of stock priced at $26. Through Thursday trading, shares had returned about 0.3% a year on average since then, while the S&P 500 has returned about 9% a year on average over the same span.  Investors just didn\u2019t warm up to an aerospace supplier with its fortunes tied predominantly to one customer, despite some success in diversifying its business. Spirit Aero\u2019s sales in 2024 are expected to be about $7.4 billion, up from $3.2 billion in 2006. That\u2019s an annual growth rate of almost 5%.  It isn\u2019t the first time that a supply business spun out of a larger manufacturing organization hasn\u2019t worked out for investors. \n        General Motors\n       spun out its parts business Delphi in 1999. \n        Ford Motor\n       followed with \n        Visteon\n      \u00a0in 2000. Both companies, in various forms, still operate today, but both had to reorganize in Chapter 11 bankruptcy roughly 10 years after being spun off.  The reason Boeing is looking at a deal is easy to see. The plane maker is looking to gain more control over quality and production in the aftermath of a Jan. 5. incident in which an emergency-door plug blew out of a 737 MAX 9 jet, leaving a hole in the fuselage. The incident resulted in an emergency landing for an \n        Alaska Air Group\n       flight as well as more oversight from the Federal Aviation Administration.  It\u2019s \u201ca massive [change] by Boeing management who have long said that they don\u2019t need to do this,\u201d said Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard. \u201cOn the plus side, it would bring Spirit AeroSystems back in house so Boeing can sort it out.\u201d  \u201cOn the negative side\u2026Boeing has no money,\u201d added Stallard. No money is hyperbole, but Boeing has added some $35 billion in long-term debt over the past few years, a consequence of the pandemic and the worldwide grounding of the 737 MAX between March 2019 and November 2020. \u201cThe most obvious issue is what happens to the [portion of] revenues that came from aerostructures built for Airbus aircraft,\u201d wrote Capital Alpha analyst Byron Callan in a Friday report. \u201cWe assume they would be divested, as Airbus is not going to want to risk enabling Boeing to conceivably have detailed insight into its production plans and aircraft designs.\u201d  Bringing Spirit Aero back into Boeing won\u2019t be easy, but Boeing may have no choice.

            "text": "Boeing Co. late Friday confirmed talks about buying supplier Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc., saying such a move would \u201cfurther strengthen aviation safety.\u201d  Boeing \n        BA,\n        +0.27%\n       said it has been in \u201cpreliminary discussions\u201d about making Spirit AeroSystems \n        SPR,\n        +2.11%\n       a part of the company again. Boeing sold assets that became Spirit AeroSystems in 2005. \u201cWe believe that the reintegration of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems\u2019 manufacturing operations would further strengthen aviation safety, improve quality and serve the interests of our customers, employees, and shareholders,\u201d the aerospace and defense company said.  Shares of both Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems gained in the extended session Friday. Spirit AeroSystems shares ended the regular trading day up 15%, while Boeing shares closed nearly 2% lower.  \u201cAlthough there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement, we are committed to finding ways to continue to improve the safety and quality of the airplanes on which millions of people depend each and every day,\u201d Boeing said.  Spirit AeroSystems issued its own, similar statement shortly after, adding it does not intend to comment further.  The Wall Street Journal reported the talks earlier Friday. Spirit AeroSystems, which makes fuselages and other plane components for Boeing, is at the center of several recent quality problems confronting the aerospace and defense company.  Investors will want to know whether this acquisition would solve the quality issues at Boeing, but the short answer to that question is no, at least not in the near term, Ken Herbert of RBC Securities said in a note Friday.  Broadly speaking, the aerospace industry is trending toward more vertical integration after several years of outsourcing, Herbert said. But news that Boeing is pursuing Spirit AeroSystems came as a surprise, he said.  \u201cWe do not believe acquiring [Spirit AeroSystems] represents a near-term fix\u201d for Boeing and the concerns about its 737 Max airplanes, Herbert said. Moreover, a purchase would add to Boeing\u2019s near-term execution issues, even though Spirit was once part of the aerospace and defense giant, he said.  On the flip side, there are potential long-term benefits for Boeing from \u201cgreater integration around tooling, supplier management, production best practices, and execution, among other factors,\u201d he said.  Spirit AeroSystems made the fuselage involved in the mid-air blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines plane last month.  A preliminary report earlier this month found that bolts were missing on that plane. Aviation regulators this week gave Boeing 90 days to come up with plan to improve safety and quality problems. Last year, Boeing and Spirit disclosed problems involving the 737 Max jets that had slowed production. Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a note Friday that a potential acquisition would be dilutive to Boeing\u2019s free cash flow, to the tune of 3.6%, or $297 million, to Jefferies\u2019 2025 cash flow estimates of $8.2 billion.  Assuming Spirit assets connected with France\u2019s Airbus SE \n        AIR,\n        -0.92%\n       are sold, the deal would not impact Boeing\u2019s top line, Kahyaoglu said. According to an earlier Wall Street Journal report, Spirit AeroSystems is also exploring the sale of its Ireland operations that support Airbus production. Those represent less than one-third of Spirit\u2019s sales, the analyst said.  Citi analyst Jason Gursky estimated that Boeing ended last year with about $22 billion in liquidity but said that if a deal were to happen, an all-stock transaction likely would make \u201cthe most sense as the success of both companies is and will remain closely tied.\u201d Gursky kept his buy ratings on both Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems shares, saying \u201cefforts to improve operations should lead to improved earnings visibility for shareholders.\u201d In the last 12 months, shares of Boeing have fallen 1.8% and shares of Spirit AeroSystems have dropped 4.5%. That contrasts with gains of around 30% for the S&P 500 \n        SPX\n       in the same time frame.

Arlington, Va.-based Boeing said it believes that a reintegration of Boeing and Spirit's manufacturing operations would further strengthen aviation safety, among other benefits. It added that an agreement between the two sides isn't guaranteed. Spirit on Friday also confirmed the discussions with Boeing. A potential deal comes as Boeing faces quality issues with its 737 MAX jets after an Alaska Airlines door-plug blowout in January. Spirit's factory in Wichita, Kan., made the fuselage involved in the accident. Boeing and Spirit have come under pressure from airline customers and federal regulators to shore up quality issues following the Alaska Airlines accident. Spirit, which makes 737 fuselages and other airframe components, was created when Boeing sold some of its factories in 2005. Boeing accounts for nearly two-thirds of Spirit's sales, with Airbus and defense companies comprising the rest.

These stocks made moves Friday: \nDell Technologies\n       posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter adjusted earnings and revenue as the maker of personal computers continues to see robust demand for artificial-intelligence servers. The company said its backlog of AI servers has now reached $2.9 billion, compared with $1.6 billion last quarter. Dell has shipped $1.5 billion of AI servers over the last two quarters, and said it has a pipeline of interest in AI servers that is \u201cmultiples\u201d of the current backlog. Dell also said it was increasing its annual cash dividend 20% to $1.78 a share. Shares surged 32%. \nSpirit Aerosystems\n       soared 15% after The Wall Street Journal reported \n        Boeing\n       was in talks to acquire the troubled parts supplier. \n        Spirit\n       has hired bankers to explore strategic options and has had preliminary discussions with its former owner, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. \n        Boeing\n       spun off \n        Spirit Aerosystems\n       in 2006. \nNew York Community Bancorp\n       plunged 26% after disclosing that fourth-quarter earnings would take a hit of $2.4 billion from a goodwill impairment charge, and separately that it had identified \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d in its loan review process. The weaknesses, the bank said, resulted from ineffective oversight, risk assessment, and monitoring activities. The regional lender also announced CEO Thomas Cangemi would be stepping down after 27 years with the bank.  \nNetApp\n       rose 18% after issuing strong guidance for 2024. The data storage company said it expects adjusted profit in the year of $6.40 and $6.50 a share, compared with previous expectations of $6.05 to $6.25. \n        NetApp\n       forecast 2024 revenue of $6.185 billion to $6.335 billion. Cybersecurity company \n        Zscaler\n       reported fiscal second-quarter adjusted profit that beat analysts\u2019 estimates as revenue rose to $525 million from $388 million a year earlier. \n        Zscaler\n       expects third-quarter adjusted earnings of 64 cents to 65 cents a share on revenue of $536 million. Analysts had been calling for third-quarter earnings of 58 cents a share on revenue of $532 million. Zscaler shares, however, fell 9.4%. \nSoundHound AI,\n       the artificial-intelligence voice technology company, narrowed its losses in the fourth quarter on a sales jump of 80%, boosted by a contribution from \u201cpre-eminent AI chip company,\u201d according to CEO Keyvan Mohajer, who wouldn\u2019t disclose the customer\u2019s name. That company is thought to be \n        Nvidia.\n       The stock though fell 19% as fourth-quarter sales of $17.1 million missed estimates of $17.7 million. \n        SoundHound\n       also had forecast that it would be profitable in the quarter on the basis of adjusted Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. But the company actually lost $3.7 million on that basis.\u00a0  \nSweetgreen\n       rose 28% after the salad-restaurant chain issued first-quarter revenue guidance higher than analysts\u2019 estimates. The company said it sees first-quarter revenue of $150 million to $154 million vesus analysts\u2019 estimates of $147.8 million. \nPlug Power\n       said doubts about its ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d no longer exist. The stock rose 10.2%. The hydrogen-technology company disclosed in a 10-K filing that losses in 2023 totaled $1.4 billion, or $2.30 a share, compared with losses in 2022 of $724 million, or $1.25 a share.\u00a0 \nElastic,\n       the enterprise data software company, reported fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings and sales that beat Wall Street estimates, and said it expects fourth-quarter sales of $328 million and $330 million, compared with expectations of $327 million. Shares declined 13%. \nAutodesk\n       posted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $2.09 a share, better than Wall Street estimates, and revenue of $1.47 billion that also beat forecasts. The stock rose 2.5%. \n        Autodesk\n       said it expects fiscal 2025 sales of $5.99 billion to $6.09 billion, higher than Wall Street forecasts of $5.96 billion. CEO Andrew Anagnost, in an interview with Barron\u2019s, highlighted opportunities the design software company has with generative artificial intelligence. \n        Fisker,\n       the electric-vehicle start-up, reported weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter sales and issued a \u201cgoing concern\u201d warning with its update. \n        Fisker\n       said it was in \u201cnegotiations with a large automaker for a potential transaction which could include an investment in Fisker, joint development of one or more electric vehicle platforms, and North America manufacturing.\u201d The company also said it intends to reduce its workforce by about 15%.

            "title": "How Larry Culp Saved GE by Breaking It Up",
            "text": "\nGeneral Electric\n       is nearing the end of its five-year journey back from the brink. For investors, a looming corporate breakup is only the beginning.\u00a0 The future looked bleak for GE in October 2018. John Flannery had just been removed as CEO after a year at the helm. Profitability was declining. GE Capital was losing money. The acquisition of \n        Alstom\u2019s\n       power business had proven disastrous. And investors were forced to sift through dozens of pages of disclosures to gain a coherent picture of the company\u2019s financial condition.  Worse still, its massive debt load\u2014some $112 billion, excluding cash and insurance liabilities\u2014was growing more unwieldy as free cash flow deteriorated, resulting in downgrades from the major credit-rating firms and a slashing of its dividend to a penny per quarter.  By the end of the year, GE stock had fallen 80% from its 2000 peak and was trading for less than it had during the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. Into this mess stepped Larry Culp, the retired CEO of \n        Danaher.\n       Culp had joined GE\u2019s board in April 2018, but now, five months later, he was being asked to do the seemingly impossible\u2014save General Electric, the company founded by Thomas Edison in 1892. Culp immediately set about selling businesses and paying down debt, before announcing in 2021 that GE would split into three separate companies.\u00a0 So far the breakup plan is working brilliantly. Since the early 2023 spinoff of \n        GE HealthCare Technologies,\n       which makes medical imaging products, shares of General Electric have gained about 120%, while GE HealthCare has gained 50%. Both have outperformed the \n        S&P 500\n       index, which has advanced 30% over the same span.  The final move is due on April 2, with General Electric splitting itself into two. The parent company will be renamed GE Aerospace, and will be a maker of airplane engines; and the power business will be spun off and named GE Vernova. Shareholders will receive one GE Vernova share for every four GE shares.  Buying General Electric stock ahead of that split could well pay off handsomely. There\u2019s a strong case that the two new stocks together will be worth more than the existing shares. Expect to hear more on that when GE management makes the cases for the new companies during its investor days on March 6 and 7. The truth is, all three of the new companies will be dominant players in their respective industries and, remarkably, all three will have investment-grade credit ratings.  \u201cWith Culp\u2019s visionary guidance, GE began one of the most amazing turnarounds I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d says Jim Osman, founder of the Edge, which provides research and recommendations about special situations such as corporate breakups and spinoffs.\u00a0 Getting here hasn\u2019t been easy. GE was a darling of the 1980s and 1990s, at one point becoming the world\u2019s most valuable company. By 2000, it was worth some $600 billion, but cracks were appearing, such as a growing reliance on financial earnings. The expansion of GE Capital, whose assets peaked at more than $600 billion in 2008, happened just in time for the 2008-09 financial crisis, and its problems didn\u2019t end there. \u201cI recall not sleeping a lot,\u201d says Culp about his early days as CEO. \u201cThere was just so much to do, so much to learn.\u201d\u00a0 Fixing GE also has meant a smaller GE. Culp aggressively sold off assets to pay down debt. GE\u2019s biopharma business was offloaded to \n        Danaher\n       for $21 billion in March 2020. GE\u2019s aircraft leasing business was sold to \n        AerCap Holdings\n       in 2021 for $30 billion. GE also exited its transportation business, merging it with \n        Wabtec\n       in 2019, while a lighting unit was sold in 2020. GE exited energy services, and GE Capital is no more\u2014the unit has been effectively shut down.\u00a0\u00a0 The results have been impressive. GE has repaid some $100 billion in debt since the end of 2018, bringing its debt load down to just $21 billion. What\u2019s more, free cash flow, which had dropped from $5.6 billion in 2017 to $2.3 billion in 2019, has started growing again: GE generated $5.2 billion in 2023 and should produce more than $6 billion in 2024. The free cash won\u2019t accrue to General Electric, at least not as we once knew it. Instead, it will go to the two new companies, while all three will bear the GE logo. GE HealthCare, which has some 50,000 workers, is already independent. It generated 2023 sales of $19.6 billion, up 7% year over year, and operating profit of $3 billion, up $100 million. The stock, at a recent $91.92, has been a winner since it started trading on a when-issued basis in 2022 and since Barron\u2019s recommended it in March 2023. GE Aerospace, though, is the crown jewel. Three-quarters of new single-aisle jets made by \n        Boeing\n       and \n        Airbus\n       carry GE engines, and they\u2019re also found on twin-aisle jetliners like the 787 Dreamliner and jet fighters like the F-18 Hornet. In total, there are more than 40,000 GE engines in commercial airliners and 26,000 in military aircraft.\u00a0 The aerospace business shows no signs of slowing down. Global air travel has nearly returned to prepandemic levels, and growth will require new planes. Both Boeing and Airbus expect the global airline fleet to grow to some 50,000 planes over the coming 20 years, up from about 25,000 today. GE\u2019s aerospace sales and orders both grew about 22% in 2023 compared with 2022. What\u2019s more, every engine GE sells needs to be serviced and cared for. That aftermarket business accounted for 70% of Aerospace\u2019s $32 billion in sales in 2023, and is more profitable than selling new equipment. Wall Street expects operating profit margins to expand by about two percentage points over the coming few years, up from about 19% in 2023, as new engines start to hit the shop for scheduled maintenance. That business should help Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, hit about $8 billion in 2024, up from $7.2 billion in 2023; it could reach $9 billion in 2025.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPhenomenally strong aftermarket franchise,\u201d says RBC analyst Ken Herbert. \u201cMassive upside on the horizon.\u201d Aerospace is so strong that it accounts for most of General Electric\u2019s current value. While it could be compared with \n        RTX,\n       which makes jet engines, flight controls, and a host of defense products, and trades for 12 times Ebitda, or \n        Safran,\n       a GE partner on the single-aisle jet engines, which trades for about 16 times, a better multiple might be that of aftermarket parts supplier \n        TransDigm Group,\n       which changes hands at 18 times. Herbert argues that\u2019s the valuation GE Aerospace deserves, which implies a value of about $160 billion based on Ebitda estimates for the coming two years, or about $140 of current General Electric\u2019s share price.   With GE shares trading at $155, that leaves about $15 for GE Vernova. That could significantly undervalue the company. Vernova didn\u2019t earn a profit in 2023\u2014it reported a bottom-line loss of $540 million\u2014and likely won\u2019t again in 2024. Still, that\u2019s an improvement. In 2018, when Scott Strazik took over the power unit, it posted sales of some $27 billion and an operating loss of more than $800 million. Operating profit margins improved from minus 3% to about 8% in 2023, as the company exited coal businesses.  The big issue at Vernova has been its wind business. While Vernova\u2019s power and electrification businesses turn a profit, the renewable-power group, which builds turbines for giant windmills, is losing between $300 million to $400 million a quarter. The wind business hasn\u2019t been great for anyone. \n        Vestas Wind Systems\n       (VWS.Denmark) posted single-digit Ebitda margins in 2023 after losing money in 2022. Inflation and fixed-price contracts, combined with fluctuating energy prices, have made the wind business tough in recent years.\u00a0 \u201cIn theory, [wind] is a business that long ago should have reached some kind of acceptable level of profit margins,\u201d says Neuberger Berman portfolio manager Evelyn Chow. That hasn\u2019t happened. What\u2019s worse, the new turbines tend to come with a host of warranty issues as well.\u00a0 Vernova, though, is more than just wind. Heading into the investor event, management has provided more financial details, including the fact that it will report in three segments instead of two: renewable wind power, gas power turbines, and the new grid business, which includes transformers, software, and other products for utilities. Solving for wind should be a big part of the event\u2014cost-cutting and product rationalization are likely to be part of the turnaround strategy\u2014but so should the strength in the other two segments. In 2023, Vernova\u2019s total sales came in at $33.2 billion, up about 11% from 2022. The gas-turbine power business generated sales of about $17.4 billion, for Ebitda of $1.7 billion, while the grid business notched $6.4 billion in sales and Ebitda of about $230 million. While wind had revenue of $9.8 billion, it produced an Ebitda loss of $1 billion, though that was an improvement from 2022\u2019s negative $1.7 billion.\u00a0\u00a0 Finding the right comparisons isn\u2019t easy. Tokyo-based \n        Mitsubishi Heavy Industries\n       (7011.Japan) makes natural-gas-powered turbines, just like Vernova, but it also builds carbon capture, hydrogen projects, and warehouses, and its sales have been flat for the past five years. It currently trades at 11 times Ebitda. Paris-based \n        Schneider Electric \n      (SU.France) makes transformers and software for the grid, and trades at 16 times. \n        Siemens Energy\n       (ENR.Germany), which has a wind, gas, and grid business similar to Vernova\u2019s, trades at just five times.  Mashing up those three stocks can yield a valuation for Vernova anywhere between $20 billion to $50 billion. One way to gauge early trading in the stock is to think of anything near the low end of that range as a good deal and near the high end as fully valued. Another option is to think about the story Vernova will try to tell\u2014that of an American company building big machines, focused on improving profit margins while growing its service and aftermarket business. That\u2019s not unlike the stories other cyclical manufacturers tell, whether the cream of the crop like \n        Deere\n       and \n        Caterpillar\n       or stragglers like\n         Ford Motor.\n       The main difference is the operating margins they\u2019re able to produce\u201417% for the former group and closer to 6% for the latter.  Those differences show up in valuations as well, with Deere and Caterpillar fetching between 12 and 18 times Ebitda, depending on where they are in the cycle, and a range of eight to 12 for the less-profitable, slower growing, companies. Vernova won\u2019t be at the top, but should grow faster than companies at the bottom.\u00a0 Putting a multiple of 10 times on expected 2025 Ebitda of $3 billion would yield $30 billion, and adding in Vernova\u2019s expected cash balance of $4.2 billion would give a market value of around $34 billion, or about $31 a GE share. Continued improvement in wind combined with more demand for wind power could lead to even better margins\u2014and perhaps a higher valuation. \u201cThe future outlook is good,\u201d says the Edge\u2019s Osman. \u201cVernova will emerge as a stronger and more focused energy player in the upcoming years.\u201d\u00a0 Osman is a fan of holding GE stock into the spinoff, which should be completed early in the second quarter, and then owning both Aerospace and Vernova. Though there won\u2019t be a company calling itself General Electric for the first time since it was incorporated more than 130 years ago, the results should speak for themselves. A couple of years of improving margins at Vernova and continued strength at GE Aerospace could make the combined companies worth $200, up 30% from the current $154.\u00a0 \u201cWe feel pretty good about [the breakup],\u201d Culp says. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Thomas Edison is looking down and saying this is the right thing.\u201d The financial markets certainly are.\u00a0 Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com JPMorgan, Walmart, and others are using the technologies to become more efficient..

            "text": "By Anthony O. Goriainoff Ryanair Holdings said it will have to make schedule cuts for the summer season after confirming it now expects Boeing to deliver only 40 of the 57 aircraft it has ordered and which were due for delivery before the end of June. The Irish low-cost carrier said the delays, combined with the grounding of up to 20% of its competitors' Airbus fleets due to the Pratt & Whitney engine issues, will lead to higher air fares in summer as capacity constrains. The airline said the delays in delivery will result in changes to its schedule and will reduce fiscal 2025's traffic to just under 200 million passengers, down from its original target of 205 million. The airline said it will reduce frequencies on existing routes rather than cut new routes for July, August and September. Ryanair said it will work with Boeing to accept aircraft deliveries during these peak months but that given the delivery uncertainties it won't be able to put these aircraft on sale for the summer 2024 season.
